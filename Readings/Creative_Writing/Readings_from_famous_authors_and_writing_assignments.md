# The Art of Creative Writing: Lesson Materials and Assignments

## Lesson 1: Finding Your Creative Voice & The Art of Short Fiction

### Reading: "The Writer's Voice" by Stephen King

Stephen King, in his memoir "On Writing," emphasizes the importance of developing a unique voice:

> "The most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn't very interesting. Stick to the parts that are, and don't get carried away with the rest. Long life stories are best received in bars, and only then an hour or so before closing time, and if you are buying."

King's advice reminds us that voice isn't just about style, but also about choice – what we choose to include and exclude in our writing.

Ernest Hemingway, master of the short story, once said:

> "All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know."

This simple yet profound advice encapsulates the essence of finding your voice and crafting compelling short fiction.

Consider the opening line of Gabriel García Márquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude":

> "Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice."

This single sentence demonstrates a unique voice, sets up an intriguing narrative, and exemplifies the art of short fiction by creating a world of possibilities in just a few words.

### Assignment: The Six-Word Story

Ernest Hemingway is famously credited with writing a six-word story that goes: "For sale: baby shoes, never worn." Your assignment is to craft your own six-word story. This exercise will challenge you to distill a narrative to its essence, helping you focus on the power of each word and develop your unique voice.

Write five different six-word stories. Each should tell a complete tale and showcase a distinct voice or perspective. After writing, reflect on which one feels most authentic to your voice and why.

## Lesson 2: Poetry: Painting with Words & Creative Non-Fiction

### Reading: "The Red Wheelbarrow" by William Carlos Williams

William Carlos Williams, known for his imagist poetry, wrote:

> "so much depends
> upon
> 
> a red wheel
> barrow
> 
> glazed with rain
> water
> 
> beside the white
> chickens"

This poem demonstrates the power of concrete imagery and how a few carefully chosen words can create a vivid picture and evoke deep emotions.

In the realm of creative non-fiction, Joan Didion said:

> "I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear."

This quote encapsulates the exploratory nature of creative non-fiction, where the act of writing becomes a journey of self-discovery.

Consider this excerpt from Mary Oliver's "The Summer Day":

> "I don't know exactly what a prayer is.
> I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
> into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,
> how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
> which is what I have been doing all day.
> Tell me, what else should I have done?
> Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?
> Tell me, what is it you plan to do
> with your one wild and precious life?"

Oliver's work beautifully blends keen observation with profound questioning, a hallmark of both poetry and creative non-fiction.

### Assignment: Sensory Poetry and Personal Essay

Part 1: Write a poem focusing on a single object, much like Williams' "The Red Wheelbarrow." Use concrete imagery and appeal to at least three senses. Keep your language simple and your lines short.

Part 2: Now, use this same object as a starting point for a brief personal essay (300-500 words). Explore what this object means to you, what memories it evokes, or what questions it raises about your life or the world around you.

## Lesson 3: Novel Writing & Character Development

### Reading: "Creating Memorable Characters" by F. Scott Fitzgerald

F. Scott Fitzgerald, author of "The Great Gatsby," was a master of character development. He once wrote:

> "Action is character."

This simple statement reminds us that characters are defined not by what we say about them, but by what they do.

Consider the opening lines of Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice":

> "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."

In this single sentence, Austen not only sets up the premise of her novel but also gives us insight into the society her characters inhabit.

Virginia Woolf, in "Mrs. Dalloway," demonstrates how to reveal character through internal monologue:

> "What a lark! What a plunge! For so it had always seemed to her, when, with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now, she had burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into the open air."

This stream of consciousness gives us immediate access to Mrs. Dalloway's personality and memories.

### Assignment: Character Creation and Novel Opening

Create a main character for a potential novel. Write a detailed character profile, including their background, personality traits, desires, and fears. Then, write the opening paragraph of your novel, introducing this character in a way that immediately gives the reader a sense of who they are. Remember Fitzgerald's advice - show us who your character is through their actions and thoughts, not just description.

## Lesson 4: Dialogue and Voice & World-Building in Writing

### Reading: "The Art of Dialogue" by Elmore Leonard

Elmore Leonard, known for his sharp, realistic dialogue, offered this advice:

> "If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it."

This emphasizes the importance of making dialogue sound natural and true to each character's voice.

For world-building, J.R.R. Tolkien, creator of Middle-earth, said:

> "The story-maker proves a successful 'sub-creator'. He makes a Secondary World which your mind can enter. Inside it, what he relates is 'true': it accords with the laws of that world. You therefore believe it, while you are, as it were, inside."

This highlights the importance of consistency and detail in creating believable fictional worlds.

Consider this exchange from Ernest Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises":

> "How did you go bankrupt?" Bill asked.
> "Two ways," Mike said. "Gradually, then suddenly."

This brief dialogue not only reveals character but also hints at a larger world and backstory.

### Assignment: Dialogue in a New World

Create a short scene (500-750 words) that takes place in a world of your own creation. The scene should primarily consist of a dialogue between two characters. Through their conversation, reveal aspects of your world's culture, history, or physical environment without resorting to explicit exposition. Pay attention to each character's distinct voice and how it reflects their place in this world.

## Lesson 5: Experimental Writing Forms & Overcoming Writer's Block

### Reading: "Creativity and Writer's Block" by Ray Bradbury

Ray Bradbury, author of "Fahrenheit 451," had this to say about writer's block:

> "If you stuff yourself full of poems, essays, plays, stories, novels, films, comic strips, magazines, music, you automatically explode every morning like Old Faithful. I have never had a dry spell in my life, mainly because I feed myself well, to the point of bursting."

This suggests that the cure for writer's block is constant exposure to various forms of creativity.

On experimental writing, Jorge Luis Borges said:

> "I cannot walk through the suburbs in the solitude of the night without thinking that the night pleases us because it suppresses idle details, just as our memory does."

Borges' works often blurred the lines between reality and fiction, encouraging us to think beyond conventional narrative structures.

Consider this excerpt from George Saunders' experimental short story "Pastoralia":

> "I have to admit I'm not feeling my best. Not that I'm doing so bad. Not that I really have anything to complain about. Not that I would actually verbally complain if I did have something to complain about. No. Because I'm Thinking Positive/Saying Positive. I'm sitting back on my haunches, waiting for people to poke their heads in. Here at the cave we're not supposed to be overly gregarious."

Saunders' unique voice and surreal setting demonstrate how experimental forms can offer fresh perspectives on familiar themes.

### Assignment: Constraint-Based Writing and Block-Busting

Part 1: Choose one of the following constraints and write a short story (300-500 words) adhering to it:
- Use only one-syllable words
- Write a story where each sentence starts with a consecutive letter of the alphabet
- Write a story without using the letter 'e'

Part 2: Set a timer for 10 minutes and engage in a free-writing exercise. Write continuously without stopping to edit or censor yourself. The goal is to overcome any blocks and let your ideas flow freely. After the time is up, review what you've written and highlight any interesting ideas or phrases that could be developed into a larger piece.

Remember, as Bradbury suggests, to "stuff yourself full" of various creative works. Make a list of books, movies, music, or art that inspire you, and commit to engaging with one item from this list each day for the next week.
