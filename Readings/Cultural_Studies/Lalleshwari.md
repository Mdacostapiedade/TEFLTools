Based on the document provided, here are some key poems by Lal Děd with brief commentary from the scholarly perspective presented in the text:

1. "One shrine to the next, the hermit can't stop for breath.
Soul, get this! You should have looked in the mirror.
Going on a pilgrimage is like falling in love 
with the greenness of faraway grass."

Commentary: This poem critiques external religious practices in favor of inner spiritual development. As the introduction notes, Lalla emphasizes "inward and inner-directed evolution, not [...] the pursuit of shrines and pilgrimages, rituals and scriptures, observances and sacrifices" (Hoskote, Introduction).

2. "I burnt up the landscape with footprints, looked for
Him everywhere. 
Then it hit me: What am I thinking, He's everywhere!
Lalla distilled this truth from a hundred pieces of talk.
Now hear this, people, and go mad!"

Commentary: This reflects Lalla's teaching that the Divine pervades all things, so seeking it externally is futile. The scholar notes this poem conveys "the understanding of the omnipresence of the Divine" (Hoskote, Introduction).

3. "I trapped my breath in the bellows of my throat:
a lamp blazed up inside, showed me who I really was.
I crossed the darkness holding fast to that lamp,
scattering its light-seeds around me as I went."

Commentary: This poem describes yogic breath control techniques and the resulting spiritual illumination. The commentary notes it refers to "ujjayi prāṇāyāma and bhastrikā prāṇāyāma" breathing practices (Hoskote, Notes).

4. "Sleep has not visited me the whole night,
Will the dawn ever come?
O my companion,
Once I awoke with a start from a dream.
Now the remembrance from that vision
Never fades."

Commentary: This expresses the sleepless longing of the devotee for the Divine. The scholar interprets it as conveying "the transformative power of even a brief spiritual experience and the subsequent intensification of longing for complete union with the Divine" (Hoskote, Notes).

5. "Wear the robe of wisdom,
brand Lalla's words on your heart, 
lose yourself in the soul's light,
you too shall be free."

Commentary: This final poem in the collection invites readers to embrace Lalla's teachings. The scholar sees it as offering "a spiritual technology of hope and liberation that can be passed on to future generations" (Hoskote, Notes).
