When one has the actual knowledge of themself, 
that is when they know their life and being
to be God, the one and only selfhood,
and this self to be one and indivisible, impossible of 
separation into multiple personalities,
then they are ready to learn how to live in 
the midst of what may seem to be trials and 
tribulations,
and walk undismayed, free and immune.
Of their personal efforts no one can think
themselves into the kingdom of heaven, redeem
themselves from what seems the necessity to
make demonstrations, or rise above the belief
that they are imperfect, insecure and incomplete.

Not until one discards everything that has
to do with personal efforts, personal getting
or demonstration, in fact everything that has
to do with the becoming,
will they be able to understand the illuminating
"I AM".

Many still need to see that there is no such
thing as personality, nor ever can be,
nor can one be "God individualized".

Let one turn absolutely and completely away
from all belief that they are other than the
one perfect life now,
that they are other than the one immaculate
body now,
all the one all-knowing, all-existing, all-supplying
Mind now.

If one finds himself unable to fulfill this
divine requirement, then of necessity they
need to be born again.

Just how can this be accomplished?
Only through the Immaculate Conception.

For instance, do you still make note of a certain
day and place where you were born of human
parents?
Do you believe that two human beings gave
you life and that you are a product of humanity?
These beliefs must be laid aside. Unless this
is done, you are bound to consider yourself
a human being,
under the law of human birth, age and death.

Each must eventually conceive themselves spiritually,
immaculately - 
that is, conceive themselves to be Spirit,
never having been born,
never having had existence apart from Spirit.
You must be born of the Spirit before you
can actually see and claim yourself to be
Spirit.

Without this rebirth or letting go of human
concepts to accept the real and the true, you
will unwittingly be attempting to place the
Immaculate Conception over the human and material
belief.
Such an attempt to gain the light of Truth
will prove inconsistent and futile.

See and think only from the standpoint that
Spirit is our only substance and identity.
The one Immaculate Body is ours here and now.
The perfect Universe of Spirit is within us
and about us.

What has been called a material world shall
be known to be the city of God.
Our body, which may seem to be physical or
material, shall be found to be immaculate,
free from spot or blemish.

There is nothing but Spirit.
Our whole mind, being, world, our Spirit,
supply, income and abundance are Spirit.
Happiness, companionship, joy and peace are
Spirit.

Through the Immaculate Conception we see the
whole body to be Spirit,
its actions and functions Spirit,
which is ever perfect in inside awareness, 
power and glory.

The truth cannot change or be changed.
And this truth means that your mind, your body,
and your world are perfect, immaculate, free
and flawless,
even at this identical moment.

Never can you be redeemed or spiritualized
by trying in any way to redeem or spiritualize
yourself.
What is your redemption?
To release yourself from all belief and teaching
that you are human or material,
and identify yourself with God,
the one Mind,
one Life, 
one Body,
one World alone.

From this true and real position you'll be
able to see and understand that which is
and that which is not.
Never accept the belief that the Infinite
has done all the thinking.
Instead, know that you are the Infinite,
and that you are to accept only that teaching
which is based upon divine knowledge, insight
and understanding.

Each must be this understanding unto themself,
not as a personality, but as the perfect Mind
Itself.
Never accept the notion that as you believe
yourself to be well, prosperous or happy, you
will become so.
There is no such thing as a becoming.

As a personality you do not control yourself
for good or bad.
You are the Self and no other.
And in you is life full and complete, knowledge
and experience of reality and truth.

None will attempt to make demonstrations after
they discover their changeless and eternal
being, their immaculate self, body and world.
Today many are busy with the changing of thoughts.
The practice of thought-changing will never
truly satisfy anyone.
For a while this idea flourished, but inevitably
the time comes when no amount of personal
thinking will bring health, happiness or success.
It will prove unavailing.

The need is for a new light, which reveals
to one that no mind stands back of discordant
pictures,
for the one Mind is without a second.
One keeps no record of the time they spend
in the glory of this new enlightenment - that
there is no second mind.
But when they come to view themselves again,
their whole vision and outlook will have cleared.
They are free.

They have penetrated into Reality and have
discovered that all belief and teaching in
a human or personal mind is wrong, and that
there is no truth in it.
Through revelation they know for a certainty
that God is One, the one Mind, and that there
can be no other mind sending out wrong thoughts
and pictures.
A mind called "the human mind", said to be responsible
for all wrong thinking as well as for discordant
pictures in the world, does not exist either
in truth or in falsity, in reality or unreality.

Discovering through insight and illumination
that there is no mind from which delusions
and illusions can come, since God-Mind is the
only Mind there is,
one is in the place of absolute peace and
harmony.
Wrong thoughts and pictures are unknown,
foreign, no time in discussing illusion, fear
or wrong thinking.

Could the sun send forth darkness as well
as light?
Or could there be another sun which produces
darkness?
Obviously no.
Even so, there can be no mind or minds in opposition
or contradistinction to the one infinite Mind
of God.
Belief in a universe or "mortal mind", as well
as belief in multitudinous single human minds,
must be exploded.

No responsibility rests upon you to remove
falsity or to attain right thinking and right
results.
You possess now and always the Mind of God,
which knows eternal perfection and completeness
to be in everyone that has existence.

Abide in this effulgent glory, 
and rest in a sweet and precious understanding
that your efforts to deal with thoughts are
now over.
Be concerned only that you are seeing and
accepting Truth as absolute.

Here you are in the Light.
You see and think with a Divine Mind.
You know consciousness and body to be one,
and to be perfect and spiritual always.
