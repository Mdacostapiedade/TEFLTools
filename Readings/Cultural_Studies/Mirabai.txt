Don't forget love
It will bring you all the madness you need
To unfill yourself
Across the Universe

I want you to have this
All the beauty in my eyes
And the grace of my mouth
All the splendor of my strength
All the wonder of the mask parts of my body
For are we not talking about real love
Real life

I came for the sake of love
Devotion seeing the world
I whipped only now the bitterness of love
Who has deeply felt its pangs
When you are in trouble no one comes near you
When fortune smiles all come to share the joy
Love shows no external wound
But the pain pervades every poor devotee

Mira offers her body as a sacrifice to Giridhar forever
My love is gone off to some foreign country
Shopping with an outdoor way
I watched the clouds rapture
Mira says nothing can harm him
Dispassion has yet to be slight

Unbreakable, oh Lord, is the love that binds me
Like a diamond it breaks a hammer that strikes
My heart goes into you as the polish goes into the gold
As the lotus lives in its water, I live in you
Like the bird that gazes all night at the passing moon
I have lost myself dwelling in you

Oh my beloved, return
Do not leave me alone
A helpless woman
My strength, my crown
I am empty of virtues
The ocean of them
My heart's music
You helped me in my world crossing
You protected the king of the elephants
You deserve the fear of the terrified
Where can I go? Save my honor
For I have dedicated myself to you
Now there is no one else for me

Only those who have felt the knife can understand the wound
Only the jeweler knows the nature of the jewel
I know a cure for sadness:
Let your hands touch something that makes your eyes smile

But tonight I finally made the connection
The change always strolled hand in hand with loss
Without people and that I would always feel it keenly
Because in the end I did not live under the same sky as most other people

Some praise me, some blame me
I go the other way
Is living on fruits and water of superior merit?
Monkeys and fish will go to heaven

Performance I went to the root of things
And found nothing but Him alone
Oh my companion, worldly comfort is an illusion
As soon as you get it, it goes

To be born in a human body is rare
Don't throw away the reward of your past good deeds
Life passes in an instant
The leaf doesn't go back to the branch
The ocean of rebirth sweeps up all beings
Hard pulls them into its cold running
Fierce implacable currents

Giridhar, your name is the raft
The one safe passage over
Take me quickly

All the awake ones travel with Mira
Singing the name she says with them
Get up, stop sleeping
The days of our life are short

Life in the world is short
Why shoulder an unnecessary load of worldly relationships?
My parents gave me birth in the world
But the Lord ordained my fate
Life passes in getting and spending
No merit is earned by virtuous deeds

I will sing the praises of Hari
In the company of the holy ones
Nothing else concerns me
Nearest Lord is the courtly Giridhar
She says only by thy power have I crossed to the farthest shore

Nothing is really mine except Krishna
Oh my parents, I have searched the world
And found nothing worthy of love
Hence I am a stranger amidst my kinfolk
And an exile from their company
Since I seek the companionship of holy ones
There alone do I feel happy

In the world I only weep
I planted the creeper of love
And silently watered it with my tears
Now it has grown and overspread my dwelling

You offered me a cup of poison
Which I drank with joy
Mira is absorbed in contemplation of Krishna
She is with God and all is well

On my mind, worship the lotus feet of the indestructible one
Whatever thou seest between earth and sky will perish
Why undertake fasts and pilgrimages?
Why engage in philosophical discussions?
Why commit suicide in panadas?

Take no pride in the body
He will soon be mingling with the dust
This is like the sporting of sparrows
It will end with the onset of night
Why don the ocher robe?
I leave home as a son Yahtzee
Those who add the external garb of a yogi
But do not penetrate to the secret
Accord again in the net of rebirth

I have felt the swaying of the elephant's shoulders
And now you want me to climb on a jackass?
Try to be serious

One night as I walked in the desert
The mountains rode on my shoulders
And the sky became my heart
And the earth my own body
I explored
Every object began to wink at me

Mira wisely calculated the situation
Thinking my charms must be at their height
Now would be a good time to rush into his arms
Maybe he won't drop me so quick

My friend, I went to the market and bought the Dark One
You claim by night, I claim by day
Actually, I was beating the drum all the time I was buying him
You say I gave too much
I say too little
Actually, I put him on a scale before I bought him
What I paid was my social body, my town body, my family body
And all my inherited jewels

Mirabai says: The Dark One is my husband now
Be with me when I lie down
You promised me this in an earlier life

Listen my friend, this road is the heart opening
Kissing his feet, resistance broken, tears all night
If we could reach the Lord through immersion in water
I would have asked to be born a fish in this life
If we could reach him through nothing but berries and wild nuts
Then surely the saints would have been monkeys when they came from the womb
If we could reach him by munching letters and dry leaves
Then the goats would surely get to the Holy One before us
If the worship of stone statues could bring us all the way
I would have adored a granite mountain years ago

I have found, yes I have found the wealth of the Divine Name's gem
My true Guru gave me a priceless thing
With his grace, I accepted it
I found the capital of my several births
I have lost the whole rest of the world
No one can spend it, no one can steal it
Day by day it increases one and a quarter times

On the boat of truth, the boatman was my true Guru
I came across the ocean of existence
Mira's Lord is the mountain holder
The suave lover of whom I merely merrily sing
