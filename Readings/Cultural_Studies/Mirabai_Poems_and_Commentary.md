1. A Cowherding girl

The plums tasted
sweet to the unlettered desert-tribe girl-
but what manners! To chew into each! She was ungainly,
low-caste, ill mannered and dirty,
but the god took the
fruit she'd been sucking.
Why? She'd knew how to love.
She might not distinquish
splendor from filth
but she'd tasted the nectar of passion.
Might not know any Veda,
but a chariot swept her away-
now she frolics in heaven, esctatically bound
to her god.
The Lord of Fallen Fools, says Mira,
will save anyone
who can practice rapture like that-
I myself in a previous birth
was a cowherding girl
at Gokul.

Commentary: This beautiful poem speaks to the essence of true devotion. The Divine does not discriminate based on caste, education, or social status. What matters is the purity and intensity of one's love. The "unlettered desert-tribe girl" represents the soul in its natural, unrefined state - full of love but lacking in worldly polish. Yet it is precisely this raw, unfiltered devotion that pleases the Divine. The Lord accepts our offerings, however imperfect they may seem to others, when they come from a place of genuine love. Mirabai's identification with the cowherding girl shows her humility and her recognition that true bhakti transcends all lifetimes and social barriers.

2. A great Yogi

In my travels I spent time with a great yogi.
Once he said to me.
"Become so still you hear the blood flowing
through your veins."
One night as I sat in quiet,
I seemed on the verge of entering a world inside so vast
I know it is the source of
all of
us.

Commentary: This poem beautifully captures the essence of deep meditation and the vastness of our inner world. The yogi's instruction to become so still as to hear the blood flowing through one's veins is a powerful metaphor for attaining a state of profound inner silence. In this silence, Mirabai discovers a vast inner world - the source of all existence. This experience points to the fundamental truth that the Divine is not separate from us but is the very essence of our being. Through stillness and introspection, we can discover this infinite source within ourselves.

3. All I Was Doing Was Breathing

Something has reached out and taken in the beams of my eyes.
There is a longing, it is for his body, for every hair of that dark body.
All I was doing was being, and the Dancing Energy came by my house.
His face looks curiously like the moon, I saw it from the side, smiling.
My family says: 'Don't ever see him again!' And they imply things in a low voice.
But my eyes have their own life; they laugh at rules, and know whose they are.
I believe I can bear on my shoulders whatever you want to say of me.
Mira says: Without the energy that lifts mountains, how am I to live?

Commentary: This poem beautifully expresses the all-consuming nature of divine love. Mirabai's longing for the Divine, represented here as Krishna, is so intense that it overtakes her entire being. The image of the "Dancing Energy" visiting her house suggests the spontaneous and joyful nature of spiritual awakening. Despite societal and familial disapproval, Mirabai remains steadfast in her devotion. Her declaration that her eyes "laugh at rules" shows the transcendent nature of true spiritual love, which goes beyond social conventions. The final line powerfully conveys that this divine love is not just a luxury, but a necessity for her very existence.

4. Clouds

Clouds -
I watched as they ruptured,
ash black and pallid I saw mountainous clouds
split and spew rain
for two hours.
Everywhere water, plants and rainwater,
a riot of green on the earth.
My lover's gone off
to some foreign country,
sopping wet at our doorway
I watch the clouds rupture.
Mira says, nothing can harm him.
This passion has yet
to be slaked.

Commentary: In this poem, Mirabai uses the imagery of monsoon clouds to symbolize the overwhelming nature of her devotion. The rupturing clouds and the ensuing downpour represent the intensity of her emotions and the transformative power of divine love. The "riot of green on the earth" suggests the spiritual rejuvenation that comes with this devotion. Even as she longs for her "lover" (Krishna) who has "gone off to some foreign country," her faith remains unshakable. The last lines beautifully capture the eternal nature of true devotion - it is a passion that can never be fully quenched, always yearning for more union with the Divine.

5. Dark Friend, what can I say?

Dark Friend, what can I say?
This love I bring
from distant lifetimes is ancient,
do not revile it.
Seeing your elegant body
I am ravished.
Visit our courtyard, hear the women
singing old hymns
On the square I've laid
out a welcome of teardrops,
body and mind I surrendered ages ago,
taking refuge
wherever your feet pass.
Mira flees from lifetime to lifetime,
your virgin.

Commentary: This poem speaks to the timeless nature of the soul's love for the Divine. Mirabai's devotion is not a fleeting emotion but an ancient connection that spans multiple lifetimes. Her plea to the "Dark Friend" (Krishna) not to revile her love shows both vulnerability and steadfastness. The image of laying out a "welcome of teardrops" is particularly poignant, symbolizing how devotion often involves both joy and pain. Mirabai's declaration of surrendering body and mind "ages ago" reflects the complete abandonment of ego in true bhakti. The final lines beautifully capture the eternal chase of the soul after the Divine, with Mirabai seeing herself as forever pure in her devotion, untouched by the world across all lifetimes.

6. Do Not Leave Me

Do not leave me alone, a helpless woman.
My strength, my crown,
I am empty of virtues,
You, the ocean of them.
My heart's music, you help me
In my world-crossing.
You protected the king of the elephants.
You dissolve the fear of the terrified.
Where can I go? Save my honour
For I have dedicated myself to you
And now there is no one else for me.

Commentary: This heartfelt plea to the Divine beautifully encapsulates the essence of complete surrender in bhakti yoga. Mirabai acknowledges her own powerlessness and sees the Divine as her sole strength and protection. The reference to the "king of the elephants" alludes to the story of Gajendra, symbolizing how the Lord comes to the aid of devoted beings in their hour of need. Mirabai's declaration that she has nowhere else to go highlights the single-pointed focus of her devotion. This poem reminds us that true spiritual progress comes when we recognize our own limitations and place our trust entirely in the Divine.

7. Drink the Nectar

Drink the nectar of the Divine Name, O human! Drink the nectar of the Divine Name!
Leave the bad company, always sit among righteous company. Hearken to the mention
of God (for your own sake).
Concupiscence, anger, pride, greed, attachment: wash these out of your
consciousness.
Mira's Lord is the Mountain-Holder, the suave lover. Soak yourself in the dye of His
colour.

Commentary: This poem serves as a spiritual instruction, urging seekers to immerse themselves in the Divine Name. The repetition of "Drink the nectar" emphasizes the transformative power of nama japa (repetition of God's name). Mirabai wisely advises to seek good company and avoid negative influences, recognizing the impact our associations have on our spiritual journey. The call to wash out negative qualities from our consciousness reminds us of the purifying nature of true devotion. The final line, urging us to soak in the "dye of His colour," beautifully captures the idea of complete identification with the Divine - the ultimate goal of bhakti.

8. Friend, without that Dark raptor

Friend, without that Dark raptor
I could not survive.
Mother-in-law shrills at me,
her daughter sneers,
the prince stumbles about in a permanent fury.
Now they've bolted my door
and mounted a guard.
But who could abandon a love
developed through uncounted lifetimes?
The Dark One is Mirabai's lord,
who else could
slake her desire?

Commentary: This poem powerfully illustrates the transformative and sustaining power of divine love. Despite facing opposition and confinement from her family, Mirabai's devotion to Krishna (the "Dark raptor") remains unshakeable. Her declaration that she "could not survive" without this love speaks to the essential nature of spiritual connection for the devoted soul. The reference to "uncounted lifetimes" suggests the eternal nature of the soul's journey towards the Divine. Mirabai's rhetorical question at the end emphasizes that only the Divine can truly satisfy the soul's deepest longings. This poem reminds us that true spiritual love transcends all worldly obstacles and oppositions.

9. Go To That Impenetrable Realm

Go to that impenetrable realm
That death himself trembles to look upon.
There plays the fountain of love
With swans sporting on its waters.
There the company of holy men is available,
And one may talk of spiritual knowledge.
There one can mediate on Shyam
And purify one's mind.
There one may bind on
The anklets of good-conduct,
And dance the dance of inner contentment.
There one may adopt a headpiece of gold
And the sixteen kinds of adornment,
Let there be love for Shyam
And indifference to all else.

Commentary: In this beautiful poem, Mirabai describes the transcendent realm of spiritual realization. This "impenetrable realm" represents the state of consciousness beyond death and rebirth, where the soul experiences unity with the Divine. The imagery of swans (symbolizing the liberated soul) and the fountain of love create a picture of supreme bliss. The emphasis on the company of holy men and spiritual knowledge reminds us of the importance of satsang (spiritual company) on the path. The dance of inner contentment and the adornments mentioned symbolize the joy and beauty of a life lived in devotion. The final lines underscore that true spiritual attainment involves complete love for the Divine (Shyam) and detachment from worldly concerns.

10. I am mad with Love

I am mad with love
And no one understands my plight.
Only the wounded
Understand the agonies of the wounded,
When the fire rages in the heart.
Only the jeweller knows the value of the jewel,
Not the one who lets it go.
In pain I wander from door to door,
But could not find a doctor.
Says Mira: Harken, my Master,
Mira's pain will subside
When Shyam comes as the doctor.

Commentary: This passionate poem beautifully captures the intensity of divine love-madness (prema). Mirabai's anguish at being misunderstood by others highlights how the path of devotion often appears irrational to those not experiencing it. The metaphor of the wounded understanding the wounded speaks to the shared experience of spiritual seekers. The jeweller metaphor reminds us that only those who truly value spiritual wealth can appreciate it. Mirabai's wandering in search of a cure for her love-sickness symbolizes the soul's restless seeking for union with the Divine. The final lines poignantly express that only the Divine (Shyam) can heal the pain of separation that He Himself has caused. This poem beautifully illustrates the paradoxical nature of spiritual longing - both painful and sweet.

11. I am pale with longing for my beloved;

I am pale with longing for my beloved;
People believe I am ill.
Seizing on every possible pretext,
I try to meet him 'by accident.'
They have sent for a country doctor;
He grabs my arm and prods it;
How can he diagnose my pain?
It's in my heart that I am afflicted.
Go home, country doctor,
Don't address me by my name;
It's the name of God that has wounded me,
Don't force your medicines on me.
The sweetness of his lips is a pot of nectar,
That's the only curd for which I crave;
Mira's Lord is Giridhar Naagar.
He will feed me nectar again and again.

Commentary: This poem beautifully illustrates the consuming nature of divine love. Mirabai's physical manifestation of her spiritual longing - becoming pale - is misunderstood by those around her as illness. This misunderstanding highlights the gap between worldly perception and spiritual experience. The futile attempts of the doctor to diagnose her condition serve as a metaphor for how material solutions cannot address spiritual needs. Mirabai's assertion that it's the name of God that has wounded her speaks to the transformative power of divine remembrance. The imagery of God's lips as a pot of nectar beautifully captures the sweetness of divine communion. This poem reminds us that true spiritual longing can only be satisfied by the Divine itself, not by any worldly remedies.

12. I Danced Before My Giridhara

I danced before my Giridhara.
Again and again I dance
To please that discerning critic,
And put His former love to the test.
I put on the anklets
Of the love of Shyam,
And behold! My Mohan stays true.
Worldly shame and family custom
I have cast to the winds.
I do not forget the beauty of the Beloved
Even for an instant.
Mira is dyed deeply in the dye of Hari.

Commentary: This joyous poem celebrates the ecstasy of devotional expression. Mirabai's dance before Giridhara (Krishna) represents the soul's joyful offering of itself to the Divine. The repetition of the dance suggests the continuous nature of devotion - it is not a one-time act but a constant expression of love. The metaphor of putting on "anklets of love" beautifully captures how devotion adorns and beautifies the soul. Mirabai's casting aside of worldly shame and family custom illustrates the transformative power of divine love, which frees one from societal constraints. The image of being "dyed deeply in the dye of Hari" speaks to the complete transformation of the devotee, who becomes one with the object of their devotion. This poem reminds us that true spiritual practice involves a total surrendering of the ego and a joyful immersion in divine love.

13. I Do Not Care About Social Norms

I will fasten the bells of his love to my feet
And dance in front of Girdhar.
Dancing and dancing I will please his eyes;
My love is an ancient one.
My love is the only truth.
I do not care about social norms
Nor do I keep my family's honour.
I cannot forget, even for a moment,
The beauty of my lover.
I am dyed in Hari's colour.

Commentary: This powerful poem expresses Mirabai's complete surrender to divine love, transcending societal norms and family expectations. The image of fastening "bells of his love" to her feet and dancing before Krishna (Girdhar) symbolizes the joyful expression of devotion. Mirabai's declaration of her love as "ancient" and "the only truth" speaks to the eternal nature of the soul's connection to the Divine. Her disregard for social norms and family honor in the face of this love illustrates the transformative power of bhakti, which can overcome all worldly attachments and concerns. The final line, "I am dyed in Hari's colour," beautifully captures the idea of complete identification with the Divine - the ultimate goal of the devotional path. This poem reminds us that true spiritual love often requires us to transcend societal expectations and conventional notions of propriety.

14. I have found

I have found, yes, I have found the wealth of the Divine Name's gem.
My true guru gave me a priceless thing. With his grace, I accepted it.
I found the capital of my several births; I have lost the whole rest of the world.
No one can spend it, no one can steal it. Day by day it increases one and a quarter
times.
On the boat of truth, the boatman was my true guru. I came across the ocean of
existence.
Mira's Lord is the Mountain-Holder, the suave lover, of whom I merrily, merrily sing.

Commentary: This joyous poem celebrates the discovery of the Divine Name, which Mirabai likens to a priceless gem. The reference to the guru highlights the importance of spiritual guidance on the path of devotion. The idea that this spiritual wealth is the "capital of several births" speaks to the culmination of many lifetimes of spiritual seeking. The description of this wealth as something that cannot be spent or stolen, and which continually increases, beautifully captures the inexhaustible nature of spiritual ri
The description of this wealth as something that cannot be spent or stolen, and which continually increases, beautifully captures the inexhaustible nature of spiritual riches. The metaphor of crossing the ocean of existence with the guru as the boatman is a powerful image of the spiritual journey. This poem reminds us of the transformative power of the Divine Name and the crucial role of the guru in spiritual awakening.

15. I Send Letters

I send letters to my Beloved,
The dear Krishna.
But He sends no message of reply,
Purposely preserving silence.
I sweep his path in readiness
And gaze and gaze
Till my eyes turn blood-shot.
I have no peace by night or day,
My heart is fit to break.
O my Master, You were my companion
In former births.
When will you come?

Commentary: This poignant poem expresses the longing and apparent separation that often characterizes the devotional path. Mirabai's one-sided correspondence with Krishna symbolizes the devotee's constant attempts to connect with the Divine, even when there seems to be no response. The act of sweeping Krishna's path and gazing until her eyes are bloodshot beautifully captures the intensity of her devotion and anticipation. The reference to Krishna as a companion in former births speaks to the eternal nature of the soul's relationship with the Divine. This poem reminds us that the spiritual path often involves periods of seeming silence or absence, which can intensify our longing and deepen our devotion.

16. I will sing the praises of Hari

We do not get a human life
Just for the asking.
Birth in a human body
Is the reward for good deeds
In former births.
Life waxes and wanes imperceptibly,
It does not stay long.
The leaf that has once fallen
Does not return to the branch.
Behold the Ocean of Transmigration.
With its swift, irresistible tide.
O Lal Giridhara, O pilot of my soul,
Swiftly conduct my barque to the further shore.
Mira is the slave of Lal Giridhara.
She says: Life lasts but a few days only.
Life in the world is short,
Why shoulder an unnecessary load
Of worldly relationships?
Thy parents gave thee birth in the world,
But the Lord ordained thy fate.
Life passes in getting and spending,
No merit is earned by virtuous deeds.
I will sing the praises of Hari
In the company of the holy men,
Nothing else concerns me.
Mira's Lord is the courtly Giridhara,
She says: Only by Thy power
Have I crossed to the further shore.

Commentary: This profound poem reflects on the preciousness of human life and the importance of using it wisely for spiritual growth. Mirabai emphasizes the rarity and brevity of human existence, urging us not to waste this opportunity. The metaphor of the fallen leaf beautifully captures the irreversibility of time. The image of the "Ocean of Transmigration" with its swift tide reminds us of the cycle of birth and death that traps unenlightened souls. Mirabai's plea to Giridhara (Krishna) to guide her across this ocean reflects the soul's yearning for liberation. The latter part of the poem emphasizes detachment from worldly relationships and the futility of mere material pursuits. Mirabai's declaration that she will sing the praises of Hari in the company of holy men highlights the importance of devotion and spiritual company. This poem serves as a powerful reminder of the true purpose of human life - to seek the Divine and attain liberation.

17. I Write Of That Journey

I remember how my mother would hold me.
I would look up at her sometimes and see her weep.
I understand now what was happening.
Love so strong a force
it broke the
cage,
and she disappeared from everything
for a blessed
moment.
All actions have evolved
From the taste of flight;
the hope of freedom
moves our cells
and limbs.
Unable to live on the earth,
Mira ventured out alone in the sky -
I write of that journey
of becoming as
free as
God.
Don't forget love;
it will bring all the madness you need
to unfurl yourself across
the universe.

Commentary: This deeply introspective poem draws parallels between human love and divine love, using the metaphor of flight to represent spiritual freedom. Mirabai's recollection of her mother's tears speaks to the transformative power of intense love, which can momentarily free us from our limited identities. The idea that all actions evolve from "the taste of flight" suggests that our deepest motivations stem from a desire for spiritual freedom. Mirabai's venture into the sky alone symbolizes the solitary nature of the spiritual journey. The final stanza beautifully captures the essence of bhakti yoga - that love, in its purest form, is the key to spiritual liberation and union with the Divine. This poem reminds us that true freedom comes from surrendering to love, even if it appears as madness to the world.

18. In A Sudden

On a sudden,
the sight,
Your look of light,
stills all,
The curd-pot
falls to the ground.
Parents and
brothers
all call a halt.
Prise out, they say,
this thing from your heart.
You've lost your path.
Says Meera:
Who but you
can see in the dark
of a heart?

Commentary: This concise yet powerful poem captures the moment of spiritual awakening and its impact on worldly life. The "look of light" represents the divine vision that transforms Mirabai's perception, causing everything else to fall away (symbolized by the falling curd-pot). The opposition from family members highlights the conflict that often arises when one embarks on a spiritual path. Their attempt to "prise out" this love from Mirabai's heart shows the incomprehension of those who haven't experienced such divine love. The final lines beautifully express the intimacy of the relationship between the devotee and the Divine - only God can truly see and understand the depths of the heart. This poem reminds us that the spiritual journey often involves facing opposition and misunderstanding from others, but the inner certainty of divine love sustains the devotee.

19. It's True I Went To The Market

My friend, I went to the market and bought the Dark One.
You claim by night, I claim by day.
Actually I was beating a drum all the time I was buying him.
You say I gave too much; I say too little.
Actually, I put him on a scale before I bought him.
What I paid was my social body, my town body, my family body, and all my inherited
jewels.
Mirabai says: The Dark One is my husband now.
Be with me when I lie down; you promised me this in an earlier life.

Commentary: This vivid poem uses the metaphor of a market transaction to describe Mirabai's total surrender to Krishna (the Dark One). The act of "buying" Krishna represents Mirabai's choice to dedicate her life to divine love. The contrast between night and day claims suggests the all-encompassing nature of this love. The beating of the drum symbolizes the joyful, public nature of her devotion. The disagreement over the price paid beautifully captures the idea that no price is too high for divine love, yet any price seems insufficient. Mirabai's payment with her "social body, town body, family body, and inherited jewels" represents her renunciation of all worldly identities and possessions. The final lines, referring to a promise from an earlier life, speak to the eternal nature of the soul's relationship with the Divine. This poem powerfully illustrates the complete surrender and transformation involved in the path of bhakti.

20. Keep Up Your Promise

Take my arm
and keep up your promise!
They call you the refugeless refuge,
they call you redeemer of outcasts.
Caught in a riptide
in the sea of becoming,
without your support I'm a shipwreck!
You reveal yourself age after age
and free the beggar
from her affliction.
Dark One, Mira is clutching your feet,
at stake is your honor!

Commentary: This impassioned plea to Krishna beautifully captures the devotee's reliance on divine grace. Mirabai reminds Krishna of his reputation as the "refugeless refuge" and "redeemer of outcasts," appealing to his compassion. The metaphor of being caught in a riptide in the "sea of becoming" vividly depicts the soul's struggle in the cycle of birth and death. Mirabai's declaration that she would be a shipwreck without divine support emphasizes the essential role of grace in spiritual life. The reference to Krishna revealing himself "age after age" alludes to the concept of divine incarnations. The final lines, where Mirabai clutches Krishna's feet and invokes his honor, show both her complete surrender and her bold expectation of divine response. This poem reminds us that on the spiritual path, we must combine our own efforts with trust in divine grace.

21. Life In The World Is Short

Life in the world is short,
Why shoulder an unnecessary load
Of worldly relationships?
Thy parents gave thee birth in the world,
But the Lord ordained thy fate.
Life passes in getting and spending,
No merit is earned by virtuous deeds.
I will sing the praises of Hari
In the company of the holy men,
Nothing else concerns me.
Mira's Lord is the courtly Giridhara,

Commentary: This poem serves as a powerful reminder of the transient nature of worldly life and the importance of focusing on spiritual pursuits. Mirabai questions the value of burdening oneself with worldly relationships, given the brevity of life. Her statement about parents giving birth but the Lord ordaining fate speaks to the interplay of human action and divine will. The observation that life passes in "getting and spending" echoes the futility of materialistic pursuits. Mirabai's resolve to sing the praises of Hari (Krishna) in the company of holy men highlights the importance of devotion and spiritual company. This poem encourages us to reflect on our priorities and to dedicate our limited time to spiritual growth rather than getting entangled in worldly affairs.

22. Listen

Listen, my friend, this road is the heart opening,
kissing his feet, resistance broken, tears all night.
If we could reach the Lord through immersion in water,
I would have asked to be born a fish in this life.
If we could reach Him through nothing but berries and wild nuts
then surely the saints would have been monkeys when they came from the womb!
If we could reach him by munching lettuce and dry leaves
then the goats would surely get to the Holy One before us!
If the worship of stone statues could bring us all the way,
I would have adored a granite mountain years ago.
Mirabai says: The heat of midnight tears will bring you to God.

Commentary: This profound poem cuts through various external practices and rituals, emphasizing the essence of true devotion. Mirabai beautifully expresses that the path to the Divine is through the opening of the heart, complete surrender (kissing his feet), and intense longing (tears all night). She then uses a series of vivid metaphors to illustrate that mere external actions or circumstances are not enough for spiritual realization. The references to fish, monkeys, and goats humorously yet pointedly show the futility of thinking that simple physical actions or austerities can lead to God. The mention of stone statues reminds us that even idol worship, if done without true devotion, is insufficient. The final line powerfully captures the essence of bhakti yoga - it is the intensity of one's longing and love for the Divine, symbolized by "midnight tears," that ultimately leads to spiritual union. This poem encourages us to look beyond outward practices and cultivate genuine, heartfelt devotion.

23. Mine is Gopal

Mine Is Gopal
Mine is Gopal, the Mountain-Holder; there is no one else.
On his head he wears the peacock-crown: He alone is my husband.
Father, mother, brother, relative: I have none to call my own.
I've forsaken both God, and the family's honor: what should I do?
I've sat near the holy ones, and I've lost shame before the people.
I've torn my scarf into shreds; I'm all wrapped up in a blanket.
I took off my finery of pearls and coral, and strung a garland of wildwood flowers.
With my tears, I watered the creeper of love that I planted;
Now the creeper has grown spread all over, and borne the fruit of bliss.
The churner of the milk churned with great love.
When I took out the butter, no need to drink any buttermilk.
I came for the sake of love-devotion; seeing the world, I wept.
Mira is the maidservant of the Mountain-Holder:
Now with love He takes me across to the further shore.

Commentary: This powerful poem expresses Mirabai's complete dedication to Krishna (Gopal) and her renunciation of worldly ties. Her declaration of Gopal as her only relation emphasizes the primacy of the divine relationship over worldly ones. The imagery of tearing her scarf, discarding finery, and wearing a blanket symbolizes her rejection of societal norms and embrace of a simple, devotional life. The metaphor of watering the "creeper of love" with tears beautifully captures the nurturing of devotion through intense emotion. The churning of milk represents spiritual practice, with the resulting "butter" of divine bliss making all lesser pleasures unnecessary. Mirabai's weeping upon seeing the world speaks to the compassion that arises from spiritual insight. The final lines, depicting Mirabai as a maidservant being carried across by her lord, beautifully capture the interplay of surrender and divine grace in the spiritual journey. This poem reminds us that true devotion often requires us to transcend societal expectations and conventional relationships, finding our ultimate fulfillment in the Divine alone.

24. No one knows my invisible life

No one knows my invisible life.
Pain
and madness for Rama.
Our wedding bed is high up
in the gallows.
Meet him?
If the dark healer comes,
we'll negotiate the hurt.
I love the man who takes care
of cows. The cowherd.
Cowherd and dancer.
My eyes are drunk,
worn out from making love
with him. We are one.
I am now his dark color.
People notice me, point fingers at me.
They see my desire,
since I'm walking about like a lunatic.
I'm wiped out, gone.
Yet no one knows I live with my prince,
the cowherd.
The palace can't contain me.
I leave it behind.
I couldn't care less about gossip
or my royal name.
I'll be with him
in all his gardens.

Commentary: This deeply personal poem reveals the intense, inner world of the devotee's relationship with the Divine. Mirabai speaks of her "invisible life" - the spiritual reality that others cannot see or understand. The vivid imagery of pain, madness, and a wedding bed in the gallows captures the paradoxical nature of divine love, which can be both agonizing and blissful. The reference to the "dark healer" suggests that the very source of her pain (separation from the Divine) is also its cure. Mirabai's love for the cowherd (Krishna) has transformed her completely, making her "one" with him and taking on his "dark color." The world's incomprehension of her state, seeing her as a lunatic, highlights the gulf between worldly perception and spiritual reality. Her disregard for her royal status and gossip shows the complete reorientation of values that comes with spiritual awakening. This poem beautifully illustrates how true devotion transcends social norms and transforms one's entire being, creating an inner reality that may seem madness to the outside world but is the ultimate truth for the devotee.

25. Nothing is really mine except Krishna.

Nothing is really mine except Krishna.
O my parents, I have searched the world
And found nothing worthy of love.
Hence I am a stranger amidst my kinfolk
And an exile from their company,
Since I seek the companionship of holy men;
There alone do I feel happy,
In the world I only weep.
I planted the creeper of love
And silently watered it with my tears;
Now it has grown and overspread my dwelling.
You offered me a cup of poison
Which I drank with joy.
Mira is absorbed in contemplation of Krishna,
She is with God and all is well!

O my King, my father, nothing delights me more
Than singing the praises of Krishna.
If thou art wrath,
then keep thy kingdom and thy palace,
For if God is angry, where can I dwell?
Thou didst send me a cup of poison and a black cobra,
Yet in all I saw only Krishna!
Mira is drunk with love, and is wedded to the Lord!

The heart of Mira is entangled
In the beauty of the feet of her Guru;

Commentary: The heart of Mira is entangled
In the beauty of the feet of her Guru;
Nothing else causes her delight!
He enabled her to be happy in the drama of the world;
The Knowledge he gave her dried up
The ocean of being and becoming.
Mira says: My whole world is Shri Krishna;
Now that my gaze is turned inward, I see it clearly

This profound poem encapsulates the essence of Mirabai's devotion and spiritual realization. Her declaration that nothing is truly hers except Krishna speaks to the ultimate truth of non-attachment and the primacy of the Divine in a devotee's life. The imagery of planting and watering the "creeper of love" with tears beautifully captures the nurturing of devotion through both joy and sorrow. Mirabai's willingness to drink poison with joy demonstrates her complete surrender and trust in Krishna. The reference to the guru's feet highlights the importance of spiritual guidance on the path of devotion. The final lines, where Mirabai sees Krishna as her whole world and perceives this clearly through inner vision, point to the ultimate goal of bhakti - complete absorption in and union with the Divine. This poem reminds us that true spiritual realization involves a radical reorientation of our perspective, where the Divine becomes the center of our existence.

26. O I saw witchcraft tonight

O I saw witchcraft tonight
in the region of Braj.
A milking girl going her rounds,
a pot on her head,
came face to face with the Dark One.
My friend, she is babbling,
can no longer say "buttermilk."
- Come get the Dark One, the Dark One!
A pot full of Shyam! -
In the overgrown lanes
of Vrindavan forest
the Enchanter of Hearts fixed his
eye on this girl,
then departed.
Mira's lord is hot, lovely
and raven -
tonight she saw witchcraft
at Braj.

Commentary: This vivid, almost cinematic poem captures a moment of divine encounter and its transformative effect. The "witchcraft" Mirabai speaks of is the enchanting, magical nature of Krishna's presence. The setting in Braj, a region associated with Krishna's earthly pastimes, adds to the mystical atmosphere. The milking girl's encounter with the "Dark One" (Krishna) leaves her in a state of divine intoxication, unable to speak of mundane things like buttermilk. The image of a "pot full of Shyam" (another name for Krishna) beautifully captures how the divine presence can fill and overflow one's being. The reference to Krishna as the "Enchanter of Hearts" speaks to his irresistible attraction for devotees. Mirabai's description of her lord as "hot, lovely and raven" expresses both the beauty and the intensity of divine love. This poem reminds us of the transformative power of even a momentary encounter with the Divine, which can turn our ordinary world into a realm of magic and wonder.

27. O my friends

O my friends,
What can you tell me of Love,
Whose pathways are filled with strangeness?
When you offer the Great One your love,
At the first step your body is crushed.
Next be ready to offer your head as his seat.
Be ready to orbit his lamp like a moth giving in to the light,
To live in the deer as she runs toward the hunter's call,
In the partridge that swallows hot coals for love of the moon,
In the fish that, kept from the sea, happily dies.
Like a bee trapped for life in the closing of the sweet flower,
Mira has offered herself to her Lord.
She says, the single Lotus will swallow you whole.

Commentary: This powerful poem explores the all-consuming and often paradoxical nature of divine love. Mirabai describes the path of love as strange and unfamiliar, challenging conventional understanding. The vivid imagery she uses - the crushed body, offering one's head as a seat for the Divine, the moth drawn to the flame - all speak to the complete self-surrender required in the path of devotion. The analogies of the deer running towards the hunter, the partridge swallowing hot coals, and the fish dying happily out of water, beautifully capture the seeming irrationality of divine love from a worldly perspective. The image of the bee trapped in a flower suggests both the sweetness and the all-encompassing nature of devotion. Mirabai's final statement about being swallowed whole by the "single Lotus" (a symbol for the Divine) speaks to the ultimate goal of bhakti - complete absorption into the Divine. This poem reminds us that the path of devotion often defies logical understanding and requires a willingness to lose oneself entirely in love for the Divine.

28. O my mind

O my mind,
Worship the lotus feet of the Indestructible One!
Whatever thou seest twixt earth and sky
Will perish.
Why undertake fasts and pilgrimages?
Why engage in philosophical discussions?
Why commit suicide in Banaras?
Take no pride in the body,
It will soon be mingling with the dust.
This life is like the sporting of sparrows,
It will end with the onset of night.
Why don the ochre robe
And leave Home as a sannyasi?
Those who adopt the external garb of a Jogi,
But do not penetrate to the secret,
Are caught again in the net of rebirth.
Mira's Lord is the courtly Giridhara.
Deign to sever, O Master.
All the knots in her heart.

Commentary: This profound poem serves as a spiritual instruction, urging the mind to focus on the eternal rather than the transient. Mirabai emphasizes the impermanence of all worldly phenomena and questions the value of external religious practices without true inner transformation. Her rhetorical questions about fasts, pilgrimages, and philosophical discussions challenge the notion that these alone can lead to spiritual realization. The vivid image of life as "the sporting of sparrows" beautifully captures its brevity and fragility. Mirabai warns against taking pride in the body or in external symbols of renunciation, emphasizing that true spirituality is an inner state. The final lines, where she asks her Lord to sever the knots in her heart, speak to the need for divine grace in overcoming our internal obstacles. This poem reminds us that genuine spiritual practice involves turning our attention inward and cultivating a direct relationship with the Divine, rather than relying solely on external rituals or appearances.

29. Only He Knows the Bitterness of Love

Only he knows the bitterness of love
Who has deeply felt its pangs.
When you are in trouble
No one comes near you:
When fortune smiles.
All come to share the joy.
Love shows no external wound.
But the pain pervades every pore
Devotee Mira offers her body
As a sacrifice to Giridhara for ever.

Commentary: This poignant poem speaks to the deeply personal and often painful nature of spiritual love. Mirabai asserts that only those who have experienced the intensity of divine love can truly understand its bittersweet nature. Her observation about fair-weather friends highlights the solitary aspect of the spiritual journey - in times of difficulty, the devotee often stands alone with their Beloved. The image of love showing no external wound but pervading every pore beautifully captures the invisible yet all-encompassing nature of spiritual anguish. Mirabai's offer of her body as a sacrifice to Giridhara (Krishna) represents the ultimate surrender of the devotee to the Divine. This poem reminds us that the path of devotion, while ultimately fulfilling, often involves periods of intense longing and apparent separation that can be understood only by those who have experienced them.

30. Out in a Downpour

Out in a downpour
in a sopping wet
skirt.
And you have gone to a distant country.
Unbearable heart,
letter after letter
just asking when,
my lord, when
are you coming?

Commentary: This brief but powerful poem vividly captures the anguish of separation from the Divine. The image of Mirabai standing in a downpour with a sopping wet skirt symbolizes her complete exposure to the elements of emotion and longing. The reference to the lord being in a "distant country" speaks to the feeling of divine absence that devotees often experience. The "unbearable heart" and the repeated letters asking when the lord will return beautifully express the intensity of spiritual yearning. This poem reminds us that the path of devotion often involves periods of apparent separation from the Divine, which can intensify our longing and deepen our love. It also highlights the devotee's persistent faith and hope for reunion, even in the face of seeming absence.

31. Sleep

Sleep has not visited me the whole night,
Will the dawn ever come?
O my companion,
Once I awoke with a start from a dream.
Now the remembrance from that vision
Never fades.
My life is ebbing as I choke and sigh,
When will the Lord of the Afflicted come
I have lost my senses and gone mad,
But the Lord knows my secret.
He who deals out life and death
nows the secret of Mira's pain.

Commentary: This deeply emotional poem expresses the sleepless longing of the devotee for the Divine. Mirabai's sleepless night and yearning for dawn symbolize the spiritual darkness and the hope for enlightenment. The reference to a dream that now never fades suggests a momentary glimpse of divine reality that has left an indelible mark on her consciousness. The imagery of life ebbing away in sighs and chokes powerfully conveys the intensity of her spiritual anguish. Mirabai's self-description as having "gone mad" speaks to how divine love can appear as insanity from a worldly perspective. The final lines, acknowledging that only the Lord knows her secret pain, highlight the deeply personal and often misunderstood nature of the devotional path. This poem beautifully captures the transformative power of even a brief spiritual experience and the subsequent intensification of longing for complete union with the Divine.

32. Strange Are The Decrees Of Fate

Strange are the decrees of fate.
Behold the large eyes of the deer!
Yet he is forced to roam the forests.
The harsh crane has brilliant plumage,
While the sweet-voiced cuckoo is black.
The rivers flow in pure streams,
But the sea makes them salt.
Fools sit on thrones as kings,
While the wise beg their bread.
Mira's lord is the courtly Giridhara:
The king persecutes the Bhaktas.

Commentary: This contemplative poem reflects on the paradoxes and apparent injustices of life. Mirabai uses a series of natural and social contrasts to illustrate the seemingly arbitrary nature of fate. The imagery of the beautiful-eyed deer forced to roam forests and the harsh crane with brilliant plumage contrasted with the sweet-voiced but black cuckoo, speaks to the often mismatched relationship between inner qualities and outer circumstances. The transformation of pure river water into salt sea water symbolizes how purity can be altered by its environment. The observation about fools as kings and the wise as beggars highlights the frequent disconnect between wisdom and worldly success. The final lines, referring to the persecution of devotees (Bhaktas) by the king, may allude to Mirabai's own experiences of opposition to her spiritual path. This poem encourages us to look beyond surface appearances and worldly measures of success, recognizing that true worth often lies hidden from immediate view.

33. Strange Is The Path When You Offer Love

Do not mention the name of love,
O my simple-minded companion.
Strange is the path
When you offer your love.
Your body is crushed at the first step.
If you want to offer love
Be prepared to cut off your head
And sit on it.
Be like the moth,
Which circles the lamp and offers its body.
Be like the deer, which, on hearing the horn,
Offers its head to the hunter.
Be like the partridge,
Which swallows burning coals
In love of the moon.
Be like the fish
Which yields up its life
When separated from the sea.
Be like the bee,
Entrapped in the closing petals of the lotus.
Mira's lord is the courtly Giridhara.
She says: Offer your mind
To those lotus feet.

Commentary: This powerful poem explores the all-consuming and often paradoxical nature of divine love. Mirabai warns that the path of love is not for the faint-hearted, using vivid and sometimes violent imagery to convey the total self-sacrifice required. The crushing of the body and the willingness to "cut off your head and sit on it" symbolize the complete annihilation of the ego necessary for true devotion. The series of analogies - the moth offering itself to the flame, the deer to the hunter, the partridge swallowing burning coals, the fish yielding its life, and the bee trapped in the lotus - all beautifully capture different aspects of self-surrender in love. These images emphasize that true devotion often appears self-destructive from a worldly perspective, yet leads to union with the Divine. The final instruction to offer one's mind to the "lotus feet" of the Divine encapsulates the essence of bhakti yoga - complete surrender of one's thoughts and identity to the Beloved. This poem reminds us that the path of devotion requires courage, commitment, and a willingness to lose oneself entirely in love for the Divine.

34. That dark Dweller in Braj

That dark Dweller in Braj
Is my only refuge.
O my companion,
Worldly comfort is an illusion,
As soon you get it, it goes.
I have chosen the Indestructible for my refuge,
Him whom the snake of death
Will not devour.
My Beloved dwells in my heart,
I have actually seen that Abode of Joy.
Mira's Lord is Hari, the Indestructible.
My Lord, I have taken refuge with Thee,
Thy slave.

Commentary: This devotional poem expresses Mirabai's complete surrender to Krishna (the "dark Dweller in Braj") and her recognition of the transient nature of worldly comforts. Her choice of the "Indestructible" as her refuge speaks to the eternal nature of the Divine, contrasted with the fleeting nature of worldly pleasures. The image of the Lord being beyond the reach of death's snake beautifully captures the idea of spiritual immortality. Mirabai's declaration of having "actually seen that Abode of Joy" in her heart suggests a direct, mystical experience of the Divine. Her self-identification as a slave of the Lord emphasizes her complete surrender and devotion. This poem reminds us of the ultimate futility of seeking lasting happiness in worldly things and encourages us to turn instead to the eternal, indestructible Divine dwelling within our own hearts.

35. The Arrow of His Glance

Friend, the arrow of his glance struck
my eyes;
Its point pierced my heart (and) his
sweet image entered my soul.
For a long time I have been staying
(here) watching the road, standing
at my house.
My life clings to (my) dark beloved,
(he is) a life-giving herb.
Mira says I am sold into the hands of
Giridhar, but people say I am loose.

Commentary: This passionate poem beautifully captures the transformative power of a single glance from the Divine. The metaphor of the glance as an arrow that pierces first the eyes, then the heart, and finally enters the soul, vividly illustrates the stages of spiritual awakening. Mirabai's patient vigil, watching the road for her beloved, speaks to the devotee's constant anticipation of divine presence. The description of her dark beloved as a "life-giving herb" suggests that this divine connection is essential for her very existence. The final line poignantly captures the misunderstanding that devoted seekers often face from society - what appears as looseness or madness to others is, for Mirabai, complete dedication to the Divine. This poem reminds us of the power of even a momentary connection with the Divine to completely reorient one's life, and how this reorientation may be misunderstood by those who haven't experienced it.

36. The Dagger

The dagger of love has pierced my heart.
I was going to the river to fetch water,
A golden pitcher on my head.
Hariji has bound me
By the thin thread of love,
And wherever He draws me,
Thither I go.
Mira's Lord is the courtly Giridhara:
This is the nature
Of his dark and beautiful form.

Commentary: This evocative poem uses the metaphor of a dagger to describe the sudden, piercing nature of divine love. The everyday scene of fetching water from the river with a golden pitcher on her head contrasts sharply with the intense spiritual experience Mirabai undergoes. The image of being bound by a "thin thread of love" beautifully captures both the delicacy and the strength of the devotee's connection to the Divine. Mirabai's willingness to go wherever she is drawn by this thread speaks to the complete surrender characteristic
Mirabai's willingness to go wherever she is drawn by this thread speaks to the complete surrender characteristic of the bhakti path. The description of Giridhara (Krishna) as both "courtly" and having a "dark and beautiful form" captures the divine's paradoxical nature - both regal and intimately accessible. This poem beautifully illustrates how divine love can interrupt and transform our ordinary lives, binding us to the Beloved with an unbreakable, yet gentle, bond.

37. The Dark One Is Krishna

Thick overhead
clouds of the monsoon,
a delight to this feverish heart.
Season of rain,
season of uncontrolled whispers---the Dark One's returning!
O swollen heart,
O sky brimming with moisture---
tongued lightning first
and then thunder,
convulsive spatters of rain
and then wind, chasing the summertime heat.
Mira says: Dark One,
I've waited---
it's time to take my songs
into the street.

Commentary: This vibrant poem uses the imagery of the monsoon season to express the devotee's anticipation of union with the Divine. The monsoon clouds bring relief to Mirabai's "feverish heart," symbolizing how the presence of the Divine soothes the pain of separation. The "uncontrolled whispers" of the rainy season mirror the devotee's excited, barely contained joy at the imminent return of the "Dark One" (Krishna). The vivid descriptions of lightning, thunder, and rain create a sense of drama and intensity that reflects Mirabai's inner emotional state. The final lines, where Mirabai declares it's time to take her songs to the street, speak to the overflowing nature of divine love - when it fills the heart, it cannot be contained but must be expressed openly. This poem beautifully captures the way in which natural phenomena can mirror and amplify our inner spiritual experiences.

38. The Heat of Midnight Tears

Listen, my friend, this road is the heart opening,
Kissing his feet, resistance broken, tears all night.
If we could reach the Lord through immersion in water,
I would have asked to be born a fish in this life.
If we could reach Him through nothing but berries and wild nuts,
Then surely the saints would have been monkeys when they came from the womb!
If we could reach him by munching lettuce and dry leaves,
Then the goats would surely go to the Holy One before us!
If the worship of stone statues could bring us all the way,
I would have adored a granite mountain years ago.
Mirabai says: The heat of midnight tears will bring you to God.

Commentary: This profound poem cuts through various external religious practices to emphasize the essence of true devotion. Mirabai describes the spiritual path as one of "heart opening," complete surrender (kissing his feet), and intense longing (tears all night). She then uses a series of vivid metaphors to illustrate that mere external actions or circumstances are not enough for spiritual realization. The references to fish, monkeys, and goats humorously yet pointedly show the futility of thinking that simple physical actions or austerities can lead to God. The mention of stone statues reminds us that even idol worship, if done without true devotion, is insufficient. The final line powerfully captures the essence of bhakti yoga - it is the intensity of one's longing and love for the Divine, symbolized by "midnight tears," that ultimately leads to spiritual union. This poem encourages us to look beyond outward practices and cultivate genuine, heartfelt devotion.

39. The Rainy Season

The rainy season is abroad
And the skirt of my dress is wet.
You have gone off to distant lands,
And my heart finds it unbearable.
I keep sending letters to my Beloved
Asking when He will return.
Mira's Lord is the courtly Giridhara:
O Krishna, O Brother of Balram,
Grant me thy sight.

Commentary: This poignant poem uses the imagery of the rainy season to express the devotee's longing for the Divine. The wet skirt symbolizes Mirabai's immersion in the emotions of separation. The reference to the Beloved being in "distant lands" captures the feeling of divine absence that devotees often experience. Mirabai's continuous sending of letters asking for the Lord's return beautifully expresses the persistent nature of spiritual yearning. The final plea for Krishna to grant his sight speaks to the ultimate goal of bhakti - direct vision of the Divine. This poem reminds us that the spiritual journey often involves periods of apparent separation from the Divine, which can intensify our longing and deepen our love.

40. The Saffron

The saffron of virtue and contentment
Is dissolved in the water-gun of love and affection.
Pink and red clouds of emotion are flying about,
Limitless colours raining down.
All the covers of the earthen vessel of my body are wide open;
I have thrown away all shame before the world.
Mira's Lord is the Mountain-Holder, the suave lover.
I sacrifice myself in devotion to His lotus feet.

Commentary: This vivid poem uses the imagery of Holi, the festival of colors, to describe the transformative power of divine love. The dissolution of virtue and contentment in the "water-gun of love" suggests that even positive qualities are transcended in the flood of devotion. The colorful clouds and limitless raining colors represent the overwhelming emotions experienced in divine love. Mirabai's description of her body as an open earthen vessel beautifully captures the idea of complete receptivity to divine grace. Her statement about throwing away all shame before the world speaks to the way intense devotion often leads one to disregard societal norms. The final lines, expressing sacrifice to the lotus feet of the Lord, emphasize the complete self-surrender characteristic of the bhakti path. This poem reminds us that true spiritual transformation often involves letting go of our carefully constructed self-image and opening ourselves completely to divine love.

41. Turn Back?

This infamy, O my Prince,
is delicious!
Some revile me,
others applaud,
I simply follow my incomprehensible road.
A razor-thin path
but you meet some good people,
a terrible path but you hear a true word.
Turn back?
Because the wretched stare and see nothing?
O Mira's lord is noble and dark,
and slanderers
rake only themselves
over the coals

Commentary: This defiant poem expresses Mirabai's unwavering commitment to her spiritual path, despite societal disapproval. Her description of infamy as "delicious" shows her disregard for worldly opinion in the face of divine love. The "incomprehensible road" she follows speaks to the often misunderstood nature of the spiritual journey. The imagery of a "razor-thin path" captures both the difficulty and the precision required on the spiritual path. Mirabai's rhetorical question about turning back emphasizes her determination to continue regardless of others' opinions. The final lines, suggesting that slanderers harm only themselves, reflect a deep understanding of the nature of karma and the ultimate irrelevance of others' judgments on one's spiritual journey. This poem encourages us to stay true to our spiritual convictions, even when they are misunderstood or criticized by others.

42. Unbreakable

Unbreakable, O Lord,
Is the love
That binds me to You:
Like a diamond,
It breaks the hammer that strikes it.
My heart goes into You
As the polish goes into the gold.
As the lotus lives in its water,
I live in You.
Like the bird
That gazes all night
At the passing moon,
I have lost myself dwelling in You.
O my Beloved - Return.

Commentary: This beautiful poem uses a series of vivid metaphors to describe the unbreakable bond between the devotee and the Divine. The comparison of love to a diamond that breaks the hammer striking it powerfully conveys the indestructible nature of true devotion. The image of the heart going into the Divine as polish into gold suggests a process of refinement and beautification through spiritual love. The lotus living in water and the bird gazing at the moon are exquisite metaphors for the devotee's complete dependence on and absorption in the Divine. The final plea for the Beloved to return speaks to the pain of apparent separation that often characterizes the devotional path. This poem beautifully captures the all-encompassing nature of divine love and the devotee's complete identification with the Beloved.

43. Why Mira Can't Come Back to Her Old House

The colors of the Dark One have penetrated Mira's body; all the other colors washed
out.
Making love with the Dark One and eating little, those are my pearls and my
carnelians.
Meditation beads and the forehead streak, those are my scarves and my rings.
That's enough feminine wiles for me. My teacher taught me this.
Approve me or disapprove me: I praise the Mountain Energy night and day.
I take the path that ecstatic human beings have taken for centuries.
I don't steal money, I don't hit anyone. What will you charge me with?
I have felt the swaying of the elephant's shoulders;
and now you want me to climb on a jackass?
Try to be serious

Commentary: This powerful poem expresses Mirabai's complete transformation through her devotion to Krishna (the Dark One) and her inability to return to conventional life. The image of Krishna's colors penetrating her body while other colors wash out beautifully captures how divine love has permeated her entire being, leaving no room for worldly attachments. Mirabai redefines her valuables in spiritual terms, seeing her devotional practices as her true jewelry. Her statement about praising the "Mountain Energy" regardless of others' approval shows her unwavering commitment to her spiritual path. The contrast between the "swaying of the elephant's shoulders" and climbing on a jackass vividly illustrates the vast difference between the spiritual life she has chosen and the mundane life others expect her to return to. This poem powerfully conveys the irreversible nature of true spiritual transformation and the impossibility of returning to ordinary worldly existence once one has tasted divine love.

44. Your Look Of Light

On a sudden,
the sight.
Your look of light
stills all,
stills
all, The curd-pot
falls to the ground.
Parents and
brothers
all call a halt.
Prise out, they say,
this thing from your heart.
You've lost your path.
Says Meera:
Who but you
can see in the dark
of a heart?

Commentary: This concise yet powerful poem captures the moment of spiritual awakening and its impact on worldly life. The "look of light" represents the divine vision that transforms Mirabai's perception, causing everything else to fall away (symbolized by the falling curd-pot). The opposition from family members highlights the conflict that often arises when one embarks on a spiritual path. Their attempt to "prise out" this love from Mirabai's heart shows the incomprehension of those who haven't experienced such divine love. The final lines beautifully express the intimacy of the relationship between the devotee and the Divine - only God can truly see and understand the depths of the heart. This poem reminds us that the spiritual journey often involves facing opposition and misunderstanding from others, but the inner certainty of divine love sustains the devotee.

45. Your Slander Is Sweet

Rana, to me your slander is sweet.
Some praise me, some blame me. I
go the other way.
On the narrow path, I found God's
people. What should I turn back for?
I am learning wisdom among the
wise, and the wicked look at me
with malice.
Mira's Lord is Giridhar Nagar.
Let the wicked burn in the kitchen fire.
Mira's God is the lifter of mountains.
I don't like your strange world, Rana,
A world where there are no holy men,
and all the people are trash.
I have given up ornaments, given up
braiding my hair.
I have given up putting on kajal
(collyrium), and putting my hair up.
Mira's Lord is Giridhar Nagar; I have
found a perfect bridegroom.

Commentary: This defiant poem expresses Mirabai's complete dedication to her spiritual path, regardless of societal opinion. Her statement that slander is "sweet" shows her ability to transmute negativity into spiritual fuel. The image of the "narrow path" where she finds "God's people" speaks to the challenging yet rewarding nature of the spiritual journey. Mirabai's rejection of the "strange world" without holy men reflects her prioritization of spiritual company over worldly associations. Her renunciation of ornaments and traditional feminine grooming symbolizes her letting go of worldly identities and attachments. The repeated reference to Giridhar Nagar (Krishna) as her Lord and perfect bridegroom emphasizes that for Mirabai, divine love has replaced all worldly relationships. This poem powerfully illustrates how the path of devotion often requires us to go against societal norms and expectations, finding our true home and identity in the Divine alone.

These poems collectively offer a profound insight into the devotional path, illustrating the intensity, challenges, and ultimate fulfillment of a life dedicated to divine love. Mirabai's words continue to inspire seekers on the spiritual path, reminding us of the transformative power of bhakti.
