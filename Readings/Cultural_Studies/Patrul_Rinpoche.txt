The wisdom of Patrul Rinpoche flows like a river, carving through the landscape of spiritual understanding. His words are arrows, precisely crafted to pierce the veil of illusion that shrouds the human experience. Let us examine the profound implications of his teachings, drawing from the wellspring of tantric knowledge.

"Pleasure and Pain alternate inexorably" - This simple statement encapsulates a fundamental truth of existence. The duality of experience, the ebb and flow of sensations and emotions, is the very fabric of our perceived reality. Like the oscillation of a pendulum, pleasure and pain swing back and forth, each giving meaning and contrast to the other. This alternation is not to be resisted but understood as the natural rhythm of life.

"Happiness comes from the south and can be found in the sound of only" - Here, Patrul Rinpoche speaks in the language of symbolism. The south, in many spiritual traditions, represents warmth, growth, and expansion. It suggests that happiness is not a destination but a direction, a way of orienting oneself towards life. The incomplete phrase "in the sound of only" hints at the ineffable nature of true happiness - it is found in the spaces between words, in the silence that underlies all sound, in the simplicity of being rather than in the complexity of doing.

"Define truth you must not cling to your convictions never remember" - This passage strikes at the heart of spiritual practice. The quest for absolute truth is a trap, for truth is not a fixed point but a living, breathing reality that shifts with each moment. Clinging to convictions, to rigid beliefs and ideologies, only serves to calcify the mind and heart. The instruction to "never remember" is particularly potent - it suggests a state of perpetual presence, where the burden of past experiences and future expectations is shed, allowing for direct, unmediated experience of reality.

"The primary purpose of meditation is to become more conscious and familiar with our inner life" - Meditation is often misunderstood as a means of escaping reality or achieving some altered state. Patrul Rinpoche cuts through this misconception, revealing meditation as a tool for deep self-exploration. By turning our attention inward, we begin to map the terrain of our consciousness, becoming intimate with the patterns of thought, emotion, and sensation that shape our experience.

"The ultimate purpose is to reach the source of life" - Beyond the immediate benefits of meditation lies a greater goal: to trace consciousness back to its origin, to dive into the wellspring from which all experience arises. This source is not separate from us but is our very essence, often obscured by the turbulence of thoughts and sensations.

"If you are angry separate yourself" - This advice seems counterintuitive in a world that often encourages us to "express" our anger. Yet, Patrul Rinpoche suggests a different approach: to create space around the anger, to observe it without becoming it. This separation allows for a profound shift in perspective, where anger is seen as a passing phenomenon rather than an integral part of one's identity.

"Just as every drop of the ocean carries the taste of the ocean, so does every moment carry the taste of Eternity" - This beautiful metaphor illuminates the fractal nature of reality. Each moment, no matter how mundane, contains within it the entirety of existence. Eternity is not a far-off realm but is present here and now, in every breath, in every heartbeat. This understanding transforms ordinary experience into a gateway to the infinite.

"The world is made of Consciousness is consciousness itself" - Here, Patrul Rinpoche points to the non-dual nature of reality. The perceiver and the perceived are not separate entities but are expressions of the same underlying consciousness. This radical unity challenges our habitual way of seeing the world as a collection of discrete objects and beings.

"In the light of Consciousness all things happening don't give special importance to any" - When seen from the perspective of pure consciousness, all phenomena are equally valid expressions of the whole. The habit of categorizing experiences as important or unimportant, good or bad, is revealed as an arbitrary imposition of the mind. This equanimity towards all experience is a hallmark of spiritual maturity.

"The song of God let them be I remember them and then make memory into a problem do not divide them" - This passage speaks to the human tendency to complicate the simplicity of being. The "song of God" is the ongoing symphony of existence, playing in every moment. Yet, we often overlay this direct experience with memories, judgments, and divisions, creating problems where none inherently exist. The instruction is to let experiences be, to allow them to arise and pass without grasping or rejecting.

"Go back to the souls go to the South it does not matter" - This enigmatic phrase suggests a return to essence, to the core of being. The reference to "the South" echoes the earlier mention of happiness coming from the south, reinforcing the idea of a directional orientation towards truth or fulfillment. Yet, paradoxically, "it does not matter" - the specific path or practice is less important than the intention and awareness brought to it.

"Hey when you go beyond the witness there's a state of non-duality in which there is no cognition" - This points to the highest states of spiritual realization, where even the subtle duality of the observer and the observed dissolves. In this state of non-dual awareness, there is no separate entity to perform the act of cognition or witnessing. It is a state of pure being, beyond the grasp of the conceptual mind.

"Only in the state of Separation seasons contemplate" - This cryptic statement suggests that our perception of time, change, and separation is a product of a particular state of consciousness. In the ultimate state of unity, there are no separate seasons to contemplate, no distinct phenomena to observe. It is only in our ordinary state of perceived separation that we experience the flow of time and the changing of seasons.

"Life is infinite undivided ever present ever active" - Here, Patrul Rinpoche offers a concise description of the nature of ultimate reality. Life, in its essence, is not bound by the limitations we typically ascribe to it. It is infinite, knowing no boundaries; undivided, free from the fragmentation of our perceptions; ever-present, existing in an eternal now; and ever-active, in constant creative flow.

"Until you realize yourself as one with it" - This phrase acknowledges that for most, this understanding of life as infinite and undivided is not an immediate reality but a potential to be realized. The journey of spiritual practice is precisely this: the gradual (or sometimes sudden) recognition of one's true nature as identical with the infinite life described.

"It is not even very difficult for you will be returning only to your own natural condition" - This is a profound encouragement to the spiritual seeker. The realization of one's true nature is not an impossible task or the acquisition of something new. Rather, it is a return to what has always been the case, a recognition of one's natural state. The difficulty we experience in this recognition is not inherent but is due to our habitual patterns of thought and perception.

"Function of the mind is to tell you what is not" - This insight into the nature of mind is particularly relevant in the context of spiritual seeking. The mind, with its categories, labels, and concepts, can only point to what something is not. It operates through distinction and differentiation. True understanding, however, comes from direct experience that transcends the limitations of conceptual thought.

"But if you want positive knowledge you must go beyond the mind" - Patrul Rinpoche concludes with a call to transcend the ordinary functioning of the mind. Positive knowledge - direct, immediate understanding of reality - cannot be grasped by thought alone. It requires a leap beyond the conceptual, into the realm of direct experience and intuitive wisdom.

In these teachings, Patrul Rinpoche weaves together profound insights from the tantric tradition with practical guidance for the spiritual path. His words serve as both a map and a mirror - outlining the territory of spiritual realization while reflecting back the true nature of the seeker. 

The path he describes is not one of accumulation or achievement, but of recognition and return. It is a journey from the complexity of conceptual understanding to the simplicity of direct experience, from the fragmentation of ordinary perception to the unity of non-dual awareness.

As arrows of wisdom, these teachings are designed to pierce through layers of conditioning, pointing directly to the heart of reality. They challenge us to look beyond our habitual ways of seeing and being, to question our most deeply held assumptions about the nature of existence, and to dive fearlessly into the depths of our own consciousness.

In the end, Patrul Rinpoche's words are not mere philosophy but an invitation to radical transformation. They call us to awaken from the dream of separation, to recognize the infinite and undivided nature of life, and to embody this understanding in every moment of our existence. This is the essence of the tantric path - not an escape from life, but a full and fearless embrace of it, recognizing all experience as a manifestation of the divine play of consciousness.
