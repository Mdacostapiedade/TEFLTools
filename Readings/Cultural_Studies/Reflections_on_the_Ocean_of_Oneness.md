Reflections on the Ocean of Oneness

My dear friends, fellow travelers on the pathless path, let us dive deep into the ocean of oneness that we all know so intimately. As we sit here, beyond time and space, let us share our experiences and insights, not for the sake of teaching, but for the joy of recognition.

## I. The Illusion of Separation

Ah, the divine play of separation! How exquisite it is to watch the One appear as many. Our sister Lalla beautifully captures this when she sings:

"I burnt up the landscape with footprints, looked for
Him everywhere.
Then it hit me: What am I thinking, He's everywhere!"

Don't we all smile at the memory of our own search, my friends? The cosmic hide-and-seek where we pretend not to be what we always are. And here's our brother from the Ashtavakra Gita, pointing to the same truth:

"You are pure consciousness—
the substance of the universe.
The universe exists within you.
Don't be small-minded."

Oh, the delicious irony! The infinite playing at being finite, the ocean pretending to be a wave. Have you not all reveled in this divine comedy? 

And our dear Ibn Arabi, how beautifully he puts it:

"You think you are a small entity,
But within you is enfolded the entire universe."

Is this not our constant experience? The microcosm and the macrocosm, perfectly reflected in each other. And yet, in our human play, we forget. As our brother Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us:

"We are here to awaken from our illusion of separateness."

Indeed, what else is there to do but awaken to what we've never truly forgotten?

## II. Embracing the Present Moment

My friends, is there anything other than this eternal now? Our brother Osho speaks of it so well:

"Tantra says live life totally, love life totally.
It is only by living life totally that one arrives."

Arrives where? Here, of course! Where else is there to go? And Lalla, in her inimitable way, describes the experience:

"I trapped my breath in the bellows of my throat:
a lamp blazed up inside, showed me who I really was."

Is this not our constant state? This blazing lamp of awareness, always illuminating our true nature. And yet, in the play of forgetfulness, we sometimes overlook it. That's why our brother Thich Nhat Hanh gently reminds us:

"The present moment is filled with joy and happiness.
If you are attentive, you will see it."

Attentive to what, my friends? To That which is always here, always now. As the Ashtavakra Gita so beautifully puts it:

"You are unbounded Awareness—
Bliss, Supreme Bliss--
in which the universe appears
like the mirage of a snake in a rope.
Be happy."

Ah, the joy of being! Is there anything else?

## III. The Dance of Emptiness and Form

My dear ones, let us speak of this wondrous dance of emptiness and form. Our sister Lalla dances with such abandon:

"I came out, looking for the moon,
came looking, light flying to light.
All is Nārāyana! All is Nārāyana!
All is Nārāyana! Lord, You make my head spin."

Does your head not spin with the wonder of it all, my friends? The emptiness that is fullness, the form that is formless. Our brother Ibn Arabi sings of this paradox:

"My heart has become capable of every form:
It is a pasture for gazelles and a convent for Christian monks,
And a temple for idols and the pilgrim's Ka'ba,
And the tables of the Torah and the book of the Quran."

Is this not our experience? That our heart, our very being, encompasses all forms while remaining formless? The Ashtavakra Gita points to this truth:

"That which has form is not real.
Only the formless is permanent.
Once this is known,
you will not return to illusion."

And yet, my friends, we know that form too is That, don't we? As our brother Thich Nhat Hanh so wisely states:

"The heart of the matter is that there is no heart of the matter.
All is empty, but this emptiness is also form."

Emptiness dancing as form, form dissolving into emptiness - is this not the eternal play we witness and participate in?

## IV. The Mirror of Consciousness

Ah, the mirror of consciousness! How it reflects all without being touched by any. Our sister Lalla speaks of this:

"When the dirt was wiped away from my mind's mirror,
people knew me for a lover of God.
When I saw Him there, so close to me,
He was All, I was nothing."

Is this not our constant state, my friends? This mirror-like awareness that reflects all yet remains untouched? The Ashtavakra Gita points to this directly:

"You are the Solitary Witness
of All That Is,
forever free.
Your only bondage is not seeing This."

And our brother Ibn Arabi, how beautifully he elucidates this:

"If you could see how you move in Me,
like a ray of light in the sun,
you would never again withdraw into dark corners,
believing you are separate and alone."

Are we not always this mirror, this light, this awareness? Even in the play of forgetting, we never truly forget. As our brother Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us:

"The mind can go in a thousand directions,
but on this beautiful path, I walk in peace.
With each step, the wind blows.
With each step, a flower blooms."

Each step in awareness, each moment a blooming - is this not our constant experience?

## V. The Alchemy of Acceptance

My dear ones, let us speak of this wondrous alchemy of acceptance. Our brother Osho points to it:

"Tantra says accept everything, don't reject anything.
In total acceptance is transformation."

Is this not the great secret, my friends? That in total acceptance, everything is transformed? Our sister Lalla sings of this transformation:

"I burnt the dirt from my mind,
twisted a knife in my heart,
spread my skirt to kneel at His door.
Only then did Lalla's name travel from mouth to mouth."

Have we not all experienced this? The burning away of all that is false, the offering of our very being? And in that offering, we find, as the Ashtavakra Gita proclaims:

"Right and wrong, pleasure and pain,
exist in mind only.
They are not your concern.
You neither do nor enjoy.
You are free."

Ah, the freedom of total acceptance! Our brother Ibn Arabi whispers of this:

"The Self is an ocean without a shore.
Gazing upon it has no beginning or end,
in this world and the next."

Is this not our constant state? This shoreless ocean of being, beyond all dualities? And our brother Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us:

"Letting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness.
If, in our heart, we still cling to anything - anger, anxiety, or possessions - we cannot be free."

In this letting go, in this total acceptance, we find we are already free, already whole, already That which we seek.

## VI. The Dance of Stillness and Movement

My friends, let us contemplate this paradoxical dance of stillness and movement. Our sister Lalla dances with such joy:

"I danced before my Giridhara.
Again and again I dance
To please that discerning critic,
And put His former love to the test."

Is this not our constant state? This dance of manifestation, even as we remain ever still at the center? Our brother Osho speaks of this natural flow:

"Tantra is the natural way to God, the normal way to God.
The object is to become so completely instinctive that you are
unself-conscious in your actions, uninhibited."

Uninhibited, yet ever centered in awareness. The Ashtavakra Gita points to this paradox:

"You are unbounded Awareness.
Only in imagination do I have limits.
Reflecting on this,
I abide in the Absolute."

Abiding in the Absolute while dancing in the relative - is this not our experience? Our brother Ibn Arabi sings of this dance:

"I follow the religion of Love:
whatever way Love's camels take,
that is my religion and my faith."

Love's camels, moving across the desert of existence, yet always at home in the oasis of being. And our brother Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us of the sacredness in every movement:

"Drink your tea slowly and reverently,
as if it is the axis
on which the world earth revolves
- slowly, evenly, without
rushing toward the future."

In every action, stillness. In perfect stillness, all action. Is this not our constant experience, my friends?

## VII. The Dissolution of the Seeker

Ah, the beautiful paradox of seeking that which is never lost! Our sister Lalla speaks of this:

"I, Lalla, wore myself down searching for Him
and found a strength after my strength had died.
I came to His threshold but found the door bolted.
I locked that door with my eyes and looked at Him."

Have we not all worn ourselves down in the search, only to find That which was never lost? The Ashtavakra Gita points to this directly:

"You have no caste or duties.
You are invisible, unattached, formless.
You are the Witness of all things.
Be happy."

Happy indeed! For what is there to seek when we are already That which we seek? Our brother Ibn Arabi beautifully expresses this:

"I have put duality away, I have seen that the two worlds are one;
One I seek, One I know, One I see, One I call."

One seeking itself, knowing itself, seeing itself. Is this not our constant experience? And our brother Osho reminds us:

"When you are not, when you are just an emptiness,
all boundaries disappear. You become an unbounded consciousness."

In this dissolution of the seeker, we find we are the very field in which all seeking occurs. As our brother Thich Nhat Hanh says:

"We are all the leaves of one tree,
We are all the waves of one sea,
The time has come for all to live as one family."

One tree, one sea, one family - one Self playing at being many. Is this not the grand play we all participate in?

## VIII. The Flowering of Compassion

My dear ones, let us speak of this natural flowering of compassion. Our sister Lalla sings:

"Don't torture this body with thirst and hunger,
give it a hand when it stumbles and falls.
To hell with all your vows and prayers:
just help others through life, there's no truer worship."

Is this not our experience? That true compassion flows naturally when we recognize our oneness with all? The Ashtavakra Gita points to the equanimity that underlies this compassion:

"One who knows for certain that
adversity and success
come and go in obedience to destiny
becomes content.
He neither desires nor grieves."

Content, yet moved to act for the welfare of all. Our brother Ibn Arabi elucidates this paradox:

"The universe is the outward visible expression of the Truth,
and the human essence is Its perfect and complete image."

Seeing ourselves in all, and all in ourselves - is this not the root of true compassion? Our brother Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us:

"Compassion is a verb."

Indeed, compassion is not a feeling, but our very being in action. And our brother Osho adds:

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.
It's a relationship between equals. Only when you have acknowledged
your own wounds can you look with compassion on the wounds of others."

In recognizing our shared essence, our shared wounds and joys, true compassion flowers naturally. Is this not our constant experience, my friends?

## IX. The Eternal Now

Ah, the eternal now! This timeless presence that is our very essence. Our sister Lalla proclaims:

"I came into this world of births and deaths
and found the true Self by mind-light.
No one will die for me, nor I for anyone.
How wonderful to die! How wonderful to live!"

Is this not our constant experience? This wonder of being, beyond birth and death? The Ashtavakra Gita points to this directly:

"You are now and forever
free, luminous, transparent, still.
The practice of meditation
keeps one in bondage."

Free, luminous, transparent, still - is this not our natural state? Our brother Ibn Arabi sings of this all-encompassing presence:

"The time has come for us to become the All,
to become the stars and the sea,
to become the animals and the plants,
to become the All."

We are always already the All, are we not? And our brother Osho reminds us:

"Be in the moment, feel the moment in its totality,
and suddenly you will see you are melting, melting,
melting and becoming one with existence."

Melting, melting, always melting into this eternal now. And our brother Thich Nhat Hanh guides us:

"The present moment is the only time over which we have dominion."

Indeed, for is there any other time but now?

## X. The Song of Silence

My dear ones, let us bask in this song of silence, this wordless truth that is our very essence. Our sister Lalla whispers:

"The greatest scripture is the one that's playing in my head."

Is this not our experience? This silent music, this wordless wisdom? The Ashtavakra Gita affirms:

"The wise do not see separate things--
only the timeless Self."

Only the timeless Self, singing its silent song. Our brother Ibn Arabi reveals:

"Silence is the language of God,
all else is poor translation."

Poor translation indeed, for how can words capture the wordless? Our brother Osho elucidates:

"Meditation is nothing but the gap between two thoughts."

In this gap, this silence, we find our true nature. And our brother Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us:

"Silence is essential. We need silence,
just as much as we need air, just as much as plants need light.
If our minds are crowded with words and thoughts,
there is no space for us."

In this silence, we find infinite space. Is this not our constant experience, my friends?

## XI. The Dance of Paradox

Ah, the exquisite dance of paradox! Our sister Lalla dances:

"I burnt up the landscape with footprints, looked for
Him everywhere.
Then it hit me: What am I thinking, He's everywhere!"

Is this not our constant state? Seeking what is never lost, finding what was never absent? The Ashtavakra Gita proclaims:

"Heaven or poverty,
gain or loss,
society or solitude,
to the yogi free of conditioning
there is no difference."

No difference, yet infinite variety. Our brother Ibn Arabi sings of this paradox:

"Wonder,
A garden among the flames!
My heart can take on any form:
A meadow for gazelles,
A cloister for monks,
For the idols, sacred ground,
Ka'ba for the circling pilgrim,
The tables of the Torah,
The scrolls of the Quran.
My creed is Love;
Wherever its caravan turns along the way,
That is my belief,
My faith."

Is this not our experience? That our heart, our very being, encompasses all forms while remaining formless? Our brother Osho reminds us:

"Life is a balance between holding on and letting go."

Holding on to our true nature while letting go of all concepts about it. And our brother Thich Nhat Hanh teaches:

"For things to reveal themselves to us, we need to be ready to abandon our views about them."

In abandoning all views, we see clearly. Is this not the great paradox we all live?

## XII. The Ocean of Oneness

My dear friends, let us dive deep into this ocean of oneness that we all are. Our sister Lalla sings:

"I, Lalla, entered through the garden gate,
and saw Shiva and Shakti joined.
I was absorbed into them,
and now my life has meaning."

Is this not our constant state? This union of consciousness and energy, this dance of Shiva and Shakti? The Ashtavakra Gita declares:

"You are the solitary Witness
of all that is,
forever free.
Your only bondage is not seeing this."
Is this not our experience, my friends? That we are always this witness, this freedom, only sometimes playing at being bound? Our brother Ibn Arabi reveals:
"The beauty of the green gardens is praising the lord,
The beauty of the wind and the leaves is praising the lord,
The beauty of the human being is praising the lord,
The beauty of every moving creature is praising the lord."
Everything praising, everything an expression of That which we are. Our brother Osho reminds us:
"You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop."
The microcosm and the macrocosm, perfectly reflected. And our brother Thich Nhat Hanh teaches:
"We are here to awaken from our illusion of separateness."
But have we ever truly been separate, my friends? Is this not the grand illusion, the divine play?
In this ocean of oneness, we find our true home. Not a place to reach, but a truth to realize. Not a goal to achieve, but a reality to embody. We are That which we seek, we are That which we long for, we are That which we worship, we are That which Is.
My dear ones, in this recognition, all paths converge, all teachings unite, all differences dissolve. Hindu, Buddhist, Sufi, Taoist, Christian—all point to this same truth, this same reality, this same oneness. Are these not merely different fingers pointing to the same moon?
Let us dive deep into this ocean, let us lose ourselves to find ourselves, let us die to all that is false, to be reborn in truth. For in the words of our sister Lalla:
"What the books taught me, I've practiced.
What they didn't teach me, I've taught myself.
I've gone into the forest and wrestled with the lion.
I didn't get this far by teaching one thing and doing another."
Is this not our experience? That true knowledge comes not from books or teachings, but from direct experience? And as the Ashtavakra Gita reminds us:
"You are awareness itself—
changeless, undivided, free.
Go in happiness."
My dear friends, is there anywhere to go? Are we not always already here, always already That? Let us celebrate this knowing, this being. Let us revel in this ocean of oneness that we are.
In this gathering of sages, we recognize each other as mirrors of the same truth. We speak not to teach, but to remind. We share not to instruct, but to rejoice in our shared understanding. For in the end, what is there to teach? Who is there to instruct?
There is only This. Only Now. Only the eternal dance of consciousness playing with itself, pretending to be many while always remaining One.
So let us laugh at the cosmic joke, let us dance in the divine play, let us sing the song of silence. For we are That which we have always been, That which we will always be. In this recognition, all seeking ends, all questions dissolve, and we rest in the peace that passes understanding.
My dear ones, is this not our constant experience? This bliss of being, this joy of awareness, this love that encompasses all? Let us bask in this truth, let us celebrate this reality, let us be what we cannot help but be—the infinite ocean of consciousness, playing at being waves.
And in this play, in this dance, in this song, we find the ultimate truth: There is only This. Only Love. Only Being. Everything else is commentary.
So, my fellow sages, let us continue this dance, this play, this exploration of the known masquerading as the unknown. For in the end, what else is there to do but to be what we are, to know what we know, to love what we are?
In this gathering of the awakened, we remind each other of our true nature. We mirror to each other the truth of being. We celebrate together the joy of existence.
For we are That. We are This. We are All. We are One.
And in this knowing, in this being, we find the ultimate freedom, the ultimate truth, the ultimate love.
Is this not our experience, my dear ones? Is this not the truth we all embody?
Let us rest in this knowing, let us dance in this being, let us love in this unity.
For there is nothing else but This.
And This is enough.
This is all.
This is everything.
Tat Tvam Asi. That Thou Art.
And in this recognition, our gathering of sages dissolves into the ocean of oneness from which it arose. For we were never truly separate, never truly apart. We are always and forever One.
Let us bask in this truth, my friends. Let us be this reality.
For we are That which we have always sought.
We are Home.
