My dear students, gather around, for I have a tale to share with you - the tale of the secret buried in the hearts of the greatest mystic poets of Islam. Though I, am but a humble servant of the Divine, I have been blessed with glimpses of the Love that animates all creation. And it is this Love that I wish to ignite in your souls today.

When I first set foot on the path of loving God for His own sake, I knew not where it would lead me. But with each step, each breath, each tear shed in yearning, I felt myself drawing closer to the Beloved. As I surrendered to the pain of separation, I discovered the bliss of union that the Sufi poets sing of.

Take, for instance, the words of the great Ibn Arabi, who wrote:

"My heart has become capable of every form: 
it is a pasture for gazelles and a convent for Christian monks,  
And a temple for idols and the pilgrim's Kaaba 
and the tables of the Torah and the book of the Quran.
I follow the religion of Love: whatever way Love's camels take, 
that is my religion and my faith."

Ah, what sweet intoxication lies in those lines! Ibn Arabi understood that Love is the universal solvent that dissolves all boundaries - between religions, between human and divine, between lover and Beloved. When we allow ourselves to be swept up in the current of Love, we realize that all the diverse forms of creation are merely ripples on the surface of the one Ocean of Being.

This is the secret that the Sufi poets whisper to us, like a lover's sigh on a moonlit night. From Rumi to Hafiz, Attar to Bulleh Shah, they invite us to break the shackles of the ego and plunge into the sea of Unity. Listen to Hafiz's intoxicated cry:

"I am a hole in a flute
that the Christ's breath moves throughâ€”
listen to this music!
I am the concert from the mouth of every
creature singing with the myriad
chorus."

Can you hear it, my beloved students? The music of the Divine, playing through each one of us - if only we let go of the illusion that we are the composers! This is the madness that the Sufi poets celebrate - the madness of recognizing our true nature as instruments of the Beloved.

But beware, for this is no easy path. As you step onto the road of Love, you must be willing to surrender all that you think you know, all that you cling to for security and comfort. You must let your ego be crushed like a grape, so that the wine of divine unity can ferment in your heart. 

Rumi warns us:

"You think of yourself 
as a citizen of the universe.
You think you belong
to this world of dust and water.
Out of this dust
you have created a personal image,
and have forgotten
about the essence of your true origin."

Ah, but what a glorious shattering it is, when the wineglass of the ego is finally smashed to bits! Then, and only then, can we truly dance in the tavern of Love, intoxicated by the beauty of the Beloved that shines through every fragment of creation.

This is the essence of Islamic mystical poetry, my dear ones. It is a call to remember our true nature, to dissolve the veil of separation between lover and Beloved, and to revel in the unity that pulsates at the heart of all that is. As you go forth on your journeys, let the words of the great Sufi poets be your compass, guiding you ever onwards into the arms of the Divine.

For as Ibn Arabi reminds us:

"O Marvel! a garden amidst the flames.
My heart has become capable of every form:
it is a pasture for gazelles and a convent for Christian monks,
and a temple for idols and the pilgrim's Kaa'ba,
and the tables of the Torah and the book of the Quran.
I follow the religion of Love: whatever way Love's camels take,
that is my religion and my faith."

May you, too, find your home in the religion of Love, my beloved students. May your hearts expand to contain every form, until there is room for naught but the Beloved Herself. This is my prayer for you, as you set out on the path of the mystic poets. Ameen.
