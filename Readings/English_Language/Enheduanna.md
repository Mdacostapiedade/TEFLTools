## The Morgan's Collection

Among the Morgan's most esteemed collections are a large group of Babylonian cylinder seals. These precious, engraved tiny objects would be rolled out to produce images and writing for various high-level officials. The Morgan has hundreds of them, displayed in a unique way that reveals much about the life, history, and culture of early Mesopotamian society.

## Setting the Scene

The exhibition transports us to the southern flood plains of modern-day Iraq, ancient Mesopotamia, in the late 4th millennium BC. This period saw the emergence of cities and the invention of writing, leading to a boom in interconnections, travel, and cultural exchange.

Around 2300 BC, an Akkadian king from middle Mesopotamia unified both the Akkadian and Sumerian worlds into the first historic empire in world history. He appointed his daughter, Enheduanna, to become the priestess of the Moon God in the city of Ur.

## Enheduanna's Importance

Enheduanna's writing was extremely important in her time and still resonates today. Her works include:

1. A group of Temple hymns aiming to unify the cultural traditions of the vast landscape.
2. The "Exaltation of Inanna," the first autobiographical work, describing her travails, including abuse and implied sexual harassment.

Her writing was so significant that it was one of the ten texts taught for hundreds of years in scribal schools.

## Legacy and Relevance

Enheduanna is the first non-anonymous author in world literature. Her writing covers concerns still relevant today:

- Insecurities
- Abuse
- The creative process
- Difficulties of creating, compared to giving birth

Understanding her work helps us connect with the past and address current issues. As the first known author, Enheduanna provides an origin story that many can relate to, bringing the 4th and 3rd millennia to life.

# Women of Mesopotamia from 3400 to 2000 BC

This exhibition tells the story of women in the third millennium BC, over 5000 years ago. It seeks to highlight the essential role of women in Mesopotamia, focusing on the poet, priestess, and princess Enheduanna, who is the first known author in history.

Now, regarding other historical written works from around this time or fitting the description of early works like Enheduanna's, I can provide some context to help develop a lineage:

1. Sumerian King List (c. 2100 BC): This is one of the earliest known historical texts, listing Sumerian kings and their reigns from the flood to the fall of the Isin dynasty.

2. Epic of Gilgamesh (c. 2100-1200 BC): While its final form dates to the Neo-Assyrian period, the earliest Sumerian poems about Gilgamesh date back to around 2100 BC.

3. Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2100-2050 BC): This is the oldest known law code surviving today, predating the Code of Hammurabi by about 300 years.

4. Pyramid Texts (c. 2400-2300 BC): These are the oldest known religious texts from ancient Egypt, carved on the walls and sarcophagi of the pyramids at Saqqara during the 5th and 6th Dynasties of the Old Kingdom.

5. Instructions of Shuruppak (c. 2600 BC): This is one of the earliest known works of literature, consisting of a collection of Sumerian wisdom literature.

6. Kesh Temple Hymn (c. 2600 BC): Another early Sumerian religious text, possibly contemporary with or slightly predating Enheduanna's works.

7. Debate between sheep and grain (c. 2500 BC): An early example of Sumerian disputations, a genre of philosophical debate literature.

These works, along with Enheduanna's writings, form the foundation of early literature in the ancient Near East. They demonstrate the development of writing from practical record-keeping to more complex literary and religious texts. Enheduanna's position as the first named author marks a significant shift towards individual authorship and autobiographical writing, influencing later literary traditions in the region and beyond.
