## Commentary

The Kesh Temple Hymn, also known as the Liturgy to Nintud, is one of the oldest known literary texts in the world. It dates back to the Early Dynastic III period of Sumer, approximately 2600-2350 BCE. This hymn provides valuable insights into the religious beliefs, architectural practices, and literary traditions of ancient Mesopotamia.

Key historical and cultural points:

1. **City of Kesh**: The hymn centers around the city of Kesh and its temple. Kesh was an important religious center in ancient Sumer, associated with the goddess Nintud (also known as Ninhursag), a mother goddess and deity of fertility and birth.

2. **Structure**: The hymn is divided into eight sections, each describing a different aspect of the temple or city. This structure may reflect the physical layout of the temple complex or represent different stages in a ritual procession.

3. **Deities**: The text mentions several important Sumerian deities, including Enlil (chief of the pantheon), An (god of the heavens), and Nisaba (goddess of writing). This reflects the polytheistic nature of Sumerian religion.

4. **Architectural descriptions**: The hymn provides vivid descriptions of the temple's architecture, comparing it to natural features like mountains and cosmic entities like the sun and moon. This gives us insight into how the Sumerians conceptualized their monumental buildings.

5. **Ritual practices**: The latter part of the hymn describes various priestly roles and ritual activities, offering a glimpse into the complex religious ceremonies conducted in Sumerian temples.

6. **Literary devices**: The text makes extensive use of repetition, metaphor, and hyperbole, which are characteristic of Sumerian literary style. The repeated refrain asking if anyone can match Kesh's greatness is a typical feature of Sumerian hymnal literature.

7. **Cosmic significance**: The temple is described as a link between heaven and earth, with its foundations in the abzu (primordial waters) and its top reaching the heavens. This reflects the Mesopotamian concept of temples as axis mundi, or the center of the world.

8. **Political implications**: The praise of Kesh and its deities may have had political as well as religious significance, asserting the city's importance within the broader Sumerian cultural sphere.

The Kesh Temple Hymn is a remarkable document that not only provides insights into ancient Sumerian religious practices but also stands as one of the earliest examples of poetic literature in human history. Its survival and translation offer us a unique window into the worldview of one of humanity's earliest civilizations.
