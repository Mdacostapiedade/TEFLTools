Hygiene
The external vulva area can be washed daily with mild, fragrance-free soap and warm water. Avoid harsh products or aggressive scrubbing.

During menstruation, it's also advisable to change underwear regularly and opt for breathable cotton varieties. Loose clothing can provide extra comfort and airflow.

It's normal for a light or mild odor to occur, but a strong, fishy, or foul smell may indicate infection and should be examined by a doctor.

When not on one's period, the vagina has self-cleansing properties. Gentle washing of just the external areas is sufficient - douching or using internal cleansers can disrupt the natural balance.

Being attuned to one's normal cycle and discharge patterns helps identify any unusual changes that may require medical attention. Overall, the key is regular changing of materials and gentle external cleansing without disrupting the vagina's healthy bacteria.

During the menstrual phase when bleeding occurs, it's important to change feminine hygiene products (pads, tampons, menstrual cups, etc.) regularly to maintain cleanliness and prevent infection or odor. How often depends on one's flow, but a good general guideline is:

Change pads/tampons every 4-8 hours or when soaked
Empty and reinsert menstrual cups every 12 hours
Rinse menstrual cups with hot water before reinserting

In addition to changing products, gentle cleansing helps prevent buildup.
