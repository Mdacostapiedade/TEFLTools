PJ Harvey: 
    "The only way to be true to yourself is to listen to that inner voice."
    "I'm always trying to move forward and not get stuck in one place."
Activity: Set a timer for 15 minutes. Close your eyes and listen to your thoughts for a moment. Then, start writing whatever comes to mind, no matter how strange or unconventional it might seem. Don't censor yourself. After the time is up, read what you've written and highlight any phrases or ideas that surprise you or feel particularly authentic.

Jack Kerouac: 
    "Something that you feel will find its own form."
    "The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time."
Activity: Choose an emotion you're feeling strongly right now. Without planning, start writing about it. Let your words flow freely, following whatever associations come to mind. Don't worry about grammar, punctuation, or structure. Write for 20 minutes non-stop. Afterward, look at your text and see what form it has naturally taken. Can you shape it into a poem, a short story, or a stream-of-consciousness piece?

Bob Marley: 
    "The truth is, everyone is going to hurt you. You just got to find the ones worth suffering for."
    "Love the life you live. Live the life you love."
Activity: Write a short story or personal essay about a character who faces a difficult choice between two paths in life. One path is safe but unfulfilling, the other is risky but potentially rewarding. Explore the character's decision-making process and the consequences of their choice.

Erykah Badu: 
    "I'm my own experiment. I'm my own work of art."
    "I'm a woman who's on a spiritual path, a woman who's on a journey of higher learning."
Activity: Imagine you are a scientist conducting an experiment on yourself. What aspect of your personality or life would you like to change or explore? Write a detailed "experimental protocol" outlining the steps you would take to transform yourself. Then, write a short piece of fiction or poetry describing the results of this self-experiment.

Ha Jin: 
    "Literature is not only a mirror; it is also a map, a geography of the mind."
    "To write is to struggle with one's soul."
Activity: Draw a map of your mind. Include places representing your memories, dreams, fears, and aspirations. Once you've created your mind map, write a travelogue describing a journey through this landscape. What do you discover about yourself along the way?

Milla Jovovich: 
    "I find that the best way to do things is to constantly move forward and to never doubt anything."
    "Never give up, never give in, and when the upper hand is ours, may we have the ability to handle the win with the dignity that we absorbed the loss."
Activity: Write a story where the main character can only move forward - physically, emotionally, or both. They're not allowed to revisit old places, repeat actions, or dwell on past thoughts. How does this constant forward motion affect their life and decisions?

Chogyam Trungpa: 
    "The bad news is you're falling through the air, nothing to hang on to, no parachute. The good news is, there's no ground."
Activity: Write a piece that starts with a character in freefall - literal or metaphorical. As they fall, have them encounter unexpected elements or realizations. How does their perspective change as they fall? Does the fall ever end, or do they learn to find freedom in the falling?

Henry Rollins: 
    "I believe that one defines oneself by reinvention. To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself. To cut yourself out of stone."
Activity: Write a series of short paragraphs, each describing a different version of yourself. Start with who you are now, then write versions of who you could be if you reinvented yourself in various ways. Finally, write about the 'core you' that remains constant through all these reinventions.

Ramana Maharshi: 
    "Your own Self-realization is the greatest service you can render the world."
Activity: Write a dialogue between your current self and your fully self-realized future self. What wisdom does your future self impart? How has their perspective on life changed? How does this self-realization impact the world around them?
