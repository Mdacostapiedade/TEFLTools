Vere-Lilin

In the primordial forests of Timor island, there lived a maiden so pure and gentle, she was beloved by all creatures of the natural realm. This woman was Vere, and she could speak the languages of every plant, animal and elemental being.

One day while bathing in a spring, Vere encountered a massive python slithering near the water's edge. With her calm spirit, she approached the serpent and addressed it in its own tongue. The python, struck by Vere's effortless communion with nature, shed its skin to reveal itself as a human prince.

The two beings recognized their spiritual connection and union. Their marriage bound Vere to become the sacred queen of Timor's wilderness, henceforth known as Vere-Lilin. All life on the island flourished under her benevolent reign.

Vere-Lilin ensured plentiful harvests, abundant flora and fauna, and peaceful coexistence between human and nature realms. The people revered her through rituals, shrines, and a covenant to protect the land's bounties. Any who neglected the forests and fields would face Vere-Lilin's judging spirit until balance was restored.
