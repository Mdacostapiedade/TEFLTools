Locating Acupressure Points and Trigger Points:
1. Use an acupressure chart or your knowledge of point locations to identify the relevant points for the client's condition.
2. Palpate the area around the point, feeling for tenderness, tightness, or nodules.
3. Confirm the location of the point by pressing gently and asking the client for feedback.
4. For trigger points, use the "search and destroy" method, pressing into the muscle until you find a tender, taut band or nodule.

Applying Pressure:
1. Once you've located the point or trigger point, apply steady, direct pressure using your thumb, finger, knuckle, or tool.
2. Gradually increase the pressure to a level that is firm but tolerable for the client.
3. Maintain the pressure for 30 seconds to 2 minutes, or until you feel a release in the tissue.
4. Use a slow, deep breathing rhythm to help the client relax and enhance the effect of the pressure.

Stretching and Movement:
1. After releasing the point or trigger point, gently stretch the affected muscle or joint.
2. Guide the client through a range of motion exercises to promote circulation and flexibility.
3. Incorporate deep breathing and visualization to help the client release tension and stress.
4. Repeat the process on other relevant points or areas, as needed.

Closing the Session:

2. Offer water and a quiet space for the client to reorient and ground themselves.
3. Discuss any changes, sensations, or insights the client experienced during the session.
4. Provide self-care recommendations, such as stretches, self-massage, or stress management techniques.
