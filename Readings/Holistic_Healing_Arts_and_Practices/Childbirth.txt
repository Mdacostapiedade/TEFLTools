Here is a description of the onset of labor, the dilation process, pain management options, and cultural traditions around childbirth:

The Onset of Labor
Labor is divided into three stages and can last hours to days. Early signs are the start of contractions and the rupture of the amniotic sac (water breaking). Contractions help dilate (open) the cervix.

Dilation and Effacement 
Dilation is measured in centimeters (cm) from 0 to 10cm. Effacement refers to the thinning and shortening of the cervix.
- Early labor: Mild contractions start dilating the cervix from 0-6 cm
- Active labor: Stronger contractions continue dilation from 6-10 cm
- Transition: The most intense part as the cervix finishes dilating to 10 cm

Pain Management Options
- Breathing techniques like Lamaze can help cope through contractions 
- Movement and massage can provide comfort and relieve tension
- Medication options include IV medications, epidural, or spinal anesthesia
- Unmedicated/natural childbirth avoids pain interventions

The Childbirth Process
- As contractions fully dilate the cervix, the urge to push increases
- Pushing through contractions helps move the baby down the birth canal
- Coached breathing or small pushes may be advised early on
- Potential interventions like forceps, vacuum, or cesarean if needed

Cultural Traditions
- In some cultures, only women are allowed in the birthing room for support
- Certain birthing positions, rituals, or ceremonies may be followed 
- Traditions around cutting the umbilical cord, delivering the placenta
- Role of a doula or other birth attendants/helpers varies

The birthing process is intensely physical but also carries rich cultural significance across societies. Having knowledge of medical practices as well as personal preferences can help prepare for this transformative experience.
