Understanding and Addressing Domestic Violence in Timor-Leste

What is Domestic Violence?

Domestic violence, also known as intimate partner violence, includes physical, emotional, sexual, and economic abuse by a current or former partner. It can happen to anyone, regardless of age, education, or social status.

Examples include:
- Physical abuse: Hitting, kicking, pushing
- Emotional abuse: Insults, threats, controlling behavior
- Sexual abuse: Forced sexual acts, marital rape
- Economic abuse: Controlling finances, preventing work

Statistics in Timor-Leste

Understanding the scale of the problem can help you realize you're not alone:

1. According to the 2009-2010 Demographic and Health Survey, 36% of women in Timor-Leste experienced intimate partner violence in the previous 12 months.

2. A study by Khan and Hyati (2012) found that in communities practicing "kaben-sai" (where brides leave their clan to join their husband's), 60% of women reported experiencing domestic violence.

3. In "kaben-tama" communities (where husbands join the bride's clan), the rate was lower at 26%, but still significant.

4. Manututo district, where bride-price (barlake) is minimal, has the lowest domestic violence prevalence rate in the country.

Cultural Context and Bride-Price

In Timor-Leste, the practice of bride-price (barlake) can complicate situations of domestic violence:

1. While barlake doesn't directly cause violence, it can contribute to attitudes of "ownership" over wives.

2. Some men use the payment of bride-price to justify controlling or abusive behavior.

3. Women may feel pressured to stay in abusive marriages due to the bride-price debt.

4. In some communities, leaving an abusive husband means the bride-price must be repaid by the woman's family.

It's important to understand that these cultural practices do not justify violence. You have the right to safety, regardless of bride-price traditions.

Recognizing Abuse

Abuse can be subtle and gradual. Signs may include:
- Feeling afraid of your partner
- Being criticized or humiliated regularly
- Having your activities or friendships controlled
- Being pressured into sexual activities you're uncomfortable with
- Having your access to money restricted

Remember, you are not to blame for the abuse. The abuser is responsible for their actions.

What You Can Do

If you're experiencing domestic violence:

1. Prioritize your safety: If you're in immediate danger, try to get to a safe place and call for help.

2. Know your rights: The Law Against Domestic Violence (LADV) of 2010 makes domestic violence a public crime in Timor-Leste. You have the right to seek help and protection.

3. Seek support: Confide in trusted friends, family members, or community leaders. You don't have to face this alone.

4. Document the abuse: If safe to do so, keep a record of incidents, including dates and details.

5. Plan for your safety: Prepare an emergency bag with important documents and necessities in case you need to leave quickly.

6. Seek help from organizations: There are NGOs and government services that can provide support, counseling, and legal advice.

7. Report to authorities: You can report domestic violence to the police. They are obligated to investigate and provide protection.

Overcoming Barriers

We understand that seeking help can be challenging due to:
- Fear of retaliation or escalated violence
- Economic dependence on the abuser
- Concerns about children
- Pressure from family or community to stay in the marriage
- Shame or stigma

Remember, your safety and well-being are paramount. There are people and organizations ready to support you through this process.
