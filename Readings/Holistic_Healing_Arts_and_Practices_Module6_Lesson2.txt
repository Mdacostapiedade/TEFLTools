Wrap-Up (1 min):
"As women, we must root our power not in renunciation of self but in the honest pursuit of self-knowledge, self-respect, and self-love." - Bell Hooks
This quote from the renowned feminist scholar bell hooks gets to the heart of why self-care is a feminist issue. For too long, women have been taught that being selfless, self-negating, and putting everyone else's needs first is the ideal. But hooks states powerfully that true female empowerment comes from the "honest pursuit" of knowing ourselves deeply, respecting our inherent worth, and ultimately loving ourselves fully.

This lesson covers an important aspect of the Women's Health module, contextualizing feminine care within a holistic healing framework. It aims to provide factual education while opening up a respectful discussion around cultural attitudes, taboos, and the pursuit of menstrual dignity. Hands-on activities and practices reinforce self-care tools students can use.
