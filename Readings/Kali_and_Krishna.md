Here is a summary of the key points from the paper "The Sword and the Flute: Kali & Krishna and Dark Visions of The Sublime" by David Kinsley, rewritten for TEFL learners in approximately 1400 words:

Introduction
- This paper looks at two important Hindu deities: Kali and Krishna. They represent two very different ideas of the sublime in Hinduism.
- The sublime refers to experiences that are overwhelmingly beautiful or powerful, sometimes in a dark or frightening way. Kali and Krishna show the light and dark sides of the sublime.

Kali
- Kali is the dark, fierce, powerful goddess. Her name means "the black one." 
- She is often shown nearly naked, with dark skin, wearing a garland of human heads and a skirt of severed arms. She sticks her red tongue out and stands on the body of her husband Shiva. 
- Kali represents death, destruction, and the unknown. She destroys the ego and liberates her followers. Meeting her is a profound spiritual experience, but also terrifying.
- In her mythology, Kali emerges in a story where the gods cannot defeat the demons. The goddess Durga and her manifestations fight the demon army. Kali appears as a fierce warrior and destroys the demons by devouring them.
- She is the power behind all life, but also consumes everything in the end. She shows that life and death, creation and destruction, are deeply linked.
- Kali forces her devotees to confront death and darkness directly. In her, the unknown and frightening parts of existence take form. Facing her shatters normal perceptions.
- She is worshipped at cremation grounds, with offerings of blood, meat, and wine. Her devotees meditate on death and try to embrace her dark Energy.
- Kali's imagery points to the sublime - the overwhelming power of the divine that destroys the ego. She reveals a vision of reality that is beautiful but terrifying, where boundaries dissolve.

Krishna 
- Krishna represents a very different idea of the sublime, focused on beauty, love and intimacy rather than darkness and destruction.  
- He is shown as a young cowherd, playing the flute, surrounded by adoring maidens and animals. 
- The stories of Krishna's childhood and youth emphasize his playful, mischievous nature and irresistible beauty. He steals butter, plays tricks, and charms everyone.
- As a youth, he is the ideal lover, especially in his relationship with his consort Radha. Krishna and Radha represent the passionate love and union between God and the human soul.
- In the bhakti tradition, Krishna is depicted as the perfect object of devotion. Worshippers yearn to have an intimate, loving relationship with him.  
- Poets describe Krishna's beauty in great detail - his dark skin, yellow garments, peacock feather, the sound of his flute. Seeing or hearing Krishna overwhelms the senses.
- In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna reveals his universal form to Arjuna. He appears as all of creation, both beautiful and terrible. This sublime vision grants liberation.
- Krishna's sublimity comes from his irresistible attractiveness, the intensity of devotion he inspires, and the experience of losing the self in him. The soul dissolves into God.

Comparing Kali and Krishna
- Kali and Krishna represent two poles of the sublime in Hinduism - the terrifying and the beautiful, the destructive and the erotic.
- Both inspire visions of the divine that shatter the ego and ordinary perception. Their intensity is overwhelming.
- Kali does this through destruction, death, and confronting the dark unknown. Krishna does it through beauty, love, and reabsorbing the self into the divine.
- In Kali, the divine is wild, uncontrollable, dangerous. In Krishna, the divine is alluring, erotic, intimate. 
- Both offer a path to liberation by transcending the limited self. Through Kali, the ego is destroyed. Through Krishna, the ego dissolves into God's love.

Conclusion
- Kali and Krishna represent two different ideas of the sublime in Hinduism, centered on the terrifying and the beautiful.
- Encountering them shatters mundane reality and worldly attachments.
- Both offer paths to transcendence and freedom, through embracing the dark and dissolving into the light. 
- Together, they point to the paradox and power of the divine in Hinduism, a reality that is overwhelming and transformative.
