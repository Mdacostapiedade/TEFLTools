Fact Sheet 1: Red Light Therapy for Skin and Muscle Health

- Red light therapy (RLT) uses low-wavelength red light to penetrate the skin and stimulate cellular energy production
- RLT can improve skin complexion, reduce wrinkles, and speed up wound healing by boosting collagen production
- Red light also enhances muscle recovery and reduces joint pain and inflammation by increasing blood flow and tissue oxygenation  
- RLT is administered through special LED light panels or wands in spas, clinics, or at home
- Regular treatments of 10-20 minutes several times a week can yield benefits, with no known side effects

Fact Sheet 2: Blue Light Therapy for Sleep and Mood Disorders

- Blue light has a short wavelength that strongly influences the body's circadian rhythm (sleep-wake cycle)
- Exposure to blue light, especially in the morning, suppresses melatonin and increases alertness and mood-regulating serotonin  
- Too much artificial blue light at night (from screens) can disrupt sleep patterns and contribute to insomnia and depression
- Blue light therapy boxes that mimic sunlight are used to treat Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), jet lag, and sleep disorders
- 20-30 minutes of exposure to a 10,000-lux light box in the morning can alleviate SAD symptoms and regulate sleep

Fact Sheet 3: Green Spaces and Nature Therapy for Stress Relief

- Spending time in green spaces like parks, forests, and gardens has measurable benefits for mental and physical health
- Natural environments reduce stress, lower heart rate and blood pressure, and improve mood and cognitive function  
- The color green is associated with growth, harmony, and balance and has a soothing effect on the nervous system
- "Forest bathing," or mindfully spending time in nature, boosts immune function and increases anti-cancer proteins
- Even brief exposure to green spaces, like office plants or nature images, can enhance wellbeing and productivity

Fact Sheet 4: Colorful Art and Decor for Emotional Wellbeing

- The colors in our surrounding environment can strongly influence our emotions, behavior, and overall sense of wellbeing
- Bright, saturated colors tend to be energizing and uplifting, while softer, muted tones are more calming and relaxing
- Certain colors are associated with specific emotional states, like red for passion, yellow for joy, blue for tranquility
- Deliberately choosing art, decor, and clothing colors can help create a desired mood or ambiance 
- Color therapy or "chromotherapy" uses color-infused light, fabrics, or visualizations to restore physical/emotional balance
- Personalizing spaces with meaningful colors and artwork enhances a sense of comfort, self-expression and connectedness
