Tinctures (Tincturae):
Description: An alcoholic or hydroalcoholic extract of plant material. Tinctures are easy to prepare, have a long shelf life, and are quickly absorbed by the body. However, they may not be suitable for those who wish to avoid alcohol.

Instructions:
1. Select the desired herb and grind it to a fine powder to increase surface area and maximize extraction.
2. Place the ground herb in a clean, dry glass jar with a tight-fitting lid.
3. Cover the herb with the appropriate strength of alcohol (usually 40-60% ethanol), ensuring that the herb is completely submerged.
4. Seal the jar tightly and store it in a cool, dark place for 2-6 weeks, depending on the herb and desired strength of the tincture.
5. Shake the jar daily to facilitate extraction and prevent the herb from settling at the bottom.
6. After the desired maceration time, strain the liquid through a fine cheesecloth or muslin, squeezing the herb material to extract as much liquid as possible.
7. Press the remaining herb material using a tincture press or similar device to extract any remaining liquid.
8. If necessary, filter the strained liquid through a coffee filter or paper filter to remove any fine sediment.
9. Store the finished tincture in a clean, dark glass bottle with a dropper top for easy dosing. Label the bottle with the herb name, alcohol strength, and date of preparation.
10. Tinctures can be stored for several years in a cool, dark place, but it is best to use them within 1-2 years for optimal potency.

In Timor-Leste, tinctures are not commonly used in traditional medicine. However, they can be prepared using locally available herbs such as noni (Morinda citrifolia) or betel leaf (Piper betle). When making tinctures, use locally produced palm wine (tua mutin) as the alcohol base. Store tinctures in a cool, dark place, as the tropical climate can accelerate degradation.

Fluid Extracts (Fluid Extracta):
Description: A concentrated liquid preparation of herbs made by percolation. Fluid extracts are more concentrated than tinctures and are easy to dose and dispense.

Instructions:
1. Grind the selected herb to a fine powder to maximize surface area and extraction efficiency.
2. Moisten the powdered herb with a small amount of the menstruum (alcohol-water mixture) until it is evenly damp but not soggy.
3. Pack the moistened herb tightly into a percolator, taking care to eliminate any air pockets.
4. Add enough menstruum to cover the herb, and allow it to macerate for 24-48 hours to soften the plant material and begin extraction.
5. After the maceration period, slowly begin percolation by allowing the liquid to drip through the herb material at a rate of 1-3 drops per second.
6. Continue adding menstruum to the percolator, ensuring that the herb remains covered, until the desired volume of liquid has been collected.
7. If necessary, concentrate the extract using low heat or vacuum distillation to achieve the desired concentration (typically 1:1 or 1:2 herb to liquid ratio).
8. Store the finished fluid extract in a clean, dark glass bottle with a tight-fitting lid. Label the bottle with the herb name, menstruum composition, and date of preparation.
9. Fluid extracts can be stored for several years in a cool, dark place, but it is best to use them within 1-2 years for optimal potency.

Fluid extracts are not commonly used in traditional Timorese medicine. If preparing fluid extracts, use locally available herbs such as papaya leaves (Carica papaya) or soursop leaves (Annona muricata). Due to the humid climate, ensure all equipment is thoroughly dried to prevent mold growth during the percolation process.

Syrups:
Description: Sweetened preparations made by adding sugar to a strong herbal decoction or infusion. Syrups are more palatable than tinctures or fluid extracts and are often used for respiratory and digestive issues.

Instructions for Syrups:
1. Prepare a strong herbal decoction or infusion using the desired herb or combination of herbs.
