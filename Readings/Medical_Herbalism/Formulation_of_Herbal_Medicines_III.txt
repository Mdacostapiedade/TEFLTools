DRY PREPARATIONS FOR HERBALISTS

Dry preparations are an important form of herbal medicine, offering convenience, precise dosing, and extended shelf life. These forms include capsules, pills, tablets, and lozenges/pastilles. Each has its own advantages and preparation methods.

1. CAPSULES

Description:
Capsules are gelatin or vegetable-based shells filled with powdered herbs or extracts. They offer a convenient way to take herbs without tasting them and allow for precise dosing.

Advantages:
- Tasteless, making it easier to take bitter or unpleasant-tasting herbs
- Precise dosing
- Easy to carry and store
- Protect herbs from light and air

Preparation Method:
a) Grind dried herbs into a fine powder using a herb grinder or coffee grinder.
b) If using a capsule machine:
   - Place empty capsule halves in the machine.
   - Spread the powdered herb over the capsules.
   - Use the spreading tool to fill the capsules evenly.
   - Place the caps on the filled halves and press to close.
c) If filling manually:
   - Open the capsule and fill the larger half with the powdered herb.
   - Press the smaller half onto the filled half to close.

In Timor-Leste, capsules are not commonly used in traditional medicine. However, they can be prepared using locally available herbs such as noni (Morinda citrifolia) or soursop (Annona muricata) leaves. When making capsules, ensure herbs are thoroughly dried to prevent mold growth in the humid climate.

Storage:
Store in airtight containers away from light and moisture. Properly stored capsules can last 1-2 years.

In Timor-Leste's tropical climate, store capsules in airtight containers with silica gel packets to absorb excess moisture. Keep in the coolest part of the house, away from direct sunlight.

2. PILLS

Description:
Pills are small, round, solid preparations of medicinal substances. They are made by mixing powdered herbs with a binding agent to form a cohesive mass that can be shaped into small balls.

Advantages:
- Can combine multiple herbs in one dose
- Relatively easy to make at home
- Can mask unpleasant tastes

Preparation Method:
a) Grind herbs into a fine powder.
b) Mix the powder with a binding agent such as honey, syrup, or marshmallow root powder.
c) Knead the mixture until it forms a pliable dough.
d) Roll small portions of the dough into balls of uniform size.
e) Roll the pills in a coating powder (like slippery elm or cinnamon) to prevent sticking.

In Timor-Leste, traditional healers sometimes use a similar method to make herbal preparations. Local honey can be used as a binding agent. Common herbs used in pill form include turmeric (Curcuma longa) and ginger (Zingiber officinale). Roll pills in locally available powders like cinnamon or dried coconut for coating.

Storage:
Store in airtight containers in a cool, dry place. Properly made and stored pills can last several months to a year.

In Timor-Leste's humid climate, store pills in airtight glass jars with moisture-absorbing materials like rice grains. Keep in a cool, dark place and check regularly for mold growth.

3. TABLETS

Description:
Tablets are compressed forms of powdered herbs, often including additional ingredients for binding and disintegration. They require specialized equipment to produce and are typically made in larger scale production.

Advantages:
- Very precise dosing
- Long shelf life
- Convenient to carry and store

Preparation Method (Note: This typically requires industrial equipment):
a) Grind herbs into a fine, uniform powder.
b) Mix with appropriate excipients (binders, disintegrants, etc.).
c) Granulate the mixture if necessary for better flow and compression properties.
d) Compress the powder or granules using a tablet press.

Tablet production is not common in traditional Timorese medicine due to the need for specialized equipment. However, some modern herbal medicine producers in Timor-Leste may use this method for commercially available products.

Storage:
Store in airtight containers away from light, heat, and moisture. Properly made and stored tablets can last 2-3 years or more.

In Timor-Leste, store tablets in airtight containers with desiccants. Keep in the coolest part of the house, away from humidity and direct sunlight. Check regularly for any signs of degradation due to the tropical climate.

4. LOZENGES (TROCHISCI) AND PASTILLES (PASTILLI)

Description:
Lozenges and pastilles are solid, usually sweetened preparations designed to dissolve slowly in the mouth. They are particularly useful for herbs that act on the mouth, throat, or respiratory system.

Advantages:
- Provide prolonged contact with the oral mucosa
- Can soothe throat and mouth conditions
- Pleasant tasting, improving compliance

Preparation Method for Lozenges:
a) Mix powdered herbs with a base of sugar and gum arabic or tragacanth.
b) Add enough water or syrup to form a pliable dough.
c) Roll out the dough and cut into desired shapes.
d) Dry the lozenges at a low temperature or at room temperature.

In Timor-Leste, lozenges can be made using local herbs like ginger or clove. Use locally produced honey or coconut sugar as a sweetener. Dry lozenges in a well-ventilated area or use a low-temperature oven if available.

Preparation Method for Pastilles:
a) Prepare a strong herbal decoction or tincture.
b) Mix with a base of sugar and gelatin or agar.
c) Heat gently until fully dissolved.
d) Pour into molds and allow to set.
e) Remove from molds and dry further if necessary.

In Timor-Leste, pastilles can be made using local fruit juices or herbal decoctions. Agar, derived from seaweed, is more suitable than gelatin in the tropical climate. Use locally available molds or shape by hand.

Storage:
Store in airtight containers in a cool, dry place. Properly made and stored lozenges and pastilles can last 6-12 months.

In Timor-Leste's humid climate, store lozenges and pastilles in airtight containers with moisture-absorbing materials. Keep in the coolest part of the house and consume within 3-4 months for best quality.

General Tips for Dry Preparations:
1. Always use well-dried herbs to prevent mold growth.
2. Ensure all equipment is clean and dry before use.
3. Label all preparations with the contents and date of manufacture.
4. Store in airtight containers away from light, heat, and moisture.
5. Check regularly for any signs of degradation or mold growth.
6. When in doubt about the quality or safety of a preparation, discard it.

In Timor-Leste, extra care must be taken due to the high humidity and heat. Dry herbs thoroughly, preferably using a dehydrator if available. Use airtight glass containers for storage and add natural desiccants like rice grains. Store preparations in the coolest part of the house, away from direct sunlight. Check preparations more frequently for signs of mold or degradation due to the tropical climate.

Remember, while these methods can be used for home preparation, always ensure you're using herbs safely and appropriately. Consult with a qualified herbalist or healthcare provider before using any herbal preparations, especially for treating specific health conditions.
