Herbal Actions

I. Adaptogen

Adaptogens are herbs that help the body adapt to and defend against the effects of stress. They increase the body's nonspecific resistance and vitality. The term was coined by Soviet scientists in 1964 to describe herbs that:

1. Show nonspecific activity - increase the body's ability to resist physical, chemical, or biological stressors
2. Have a normalizing influence independent of the nature of the pathological state  
3. Are innocuous and do not influence normal body functions more than required

Adaptogens work by:
- Enabling a more rapid but less exaggerated stress response 
- Allowing a more sustained peak response
- Fostering a more gradual decline after the stressor

This helps conserve energy and smooth out the highs and lows associated with the stress response. Adaptogens appear to work by altering endocrine functions, particularly of the pituitary-adrenal axis. They help normalize stress hormone levels and decrease overall predisposition to stress. 

Adaptogens also have immunostimulatory effects and can activate cognitive functions. The exact cellular mechanisms are still unknown. Common adaptogenic herbs include:

- Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng)  
- Panax ginseng (Korean ginseng)
- Rhodiola rosea (roseroot)
- Schisandra chinensis (schisandra)
- Withania somnifera (ashwagandha)
- Centella asiatica (gotu kola) - native to Southeast Asia and available in Timor-Leste
- Ocimum tenuiflorum (holy basil) - cultivated in Timor-Leste

Vocabulary:
Adaptogen - Herb that increases the body's resistance to stress
Nonspecific resistance - General ability to withstand various stressors
Endocrine - Relating to hormones and glands that secrete them 
Pituitary-adrenal axis - Interaction between pituitary and adrenal glands in stress response
Immunostimulatory - Enhancing immune system function

II. Alterative 

Alteratives are herbs that gradually restore proper function to the body, increasing overall health and vitality. They are thought to work by improving the body's ability to eliminate metabolic waste products and assimilate nutrients. Many alteratives support elimination through the kidneys, liver, lungs, or skin. Some stimulate digestive function or modulate immune responses.

Alteratives are often called "blood cleansers" in folk traditions, though this is not literally accurate. They can be used safely as supportive therapy for many chronic inflammatory and degenerative conditions, including skin diseases, arthritis, and autoimmune disorders. 

The mechanism of alterative herbs is not fully understood, but may relate to their content of saponins and other immunomodulating compounds. Important alterative herbs include:

- Arctium lappa (burdock)
- Baptisia tinctoria (wild indigo) 
- Echinacea spp. (echinacea)
- Galium aparine (cleavers)
- Mahonia aquifolium (Oregon grape)
- Rumex crispus (yellow dock)
- Trifolium pratense (red clover)
- Urtica dioica (nettle)
- Moringa oleifera (moringa) - widely cultivated in Timor-Leste
- Azadirachta indica (neem) - found in Timor-Leste

Alteratives can be grouped by their primary elimination pathway:
- Leaf alteratives tend to work via the kidneys/diuresis 
- Root/rhizome alteratives tend to work via the liver

Vocabulary:
Alterative - Herb that gradually restores proper body function
Metabolic waste - Byproducts of cellular metabolism that must be eliminated
Assimilate - Absorb and integrate (nutrients)
Saponin - Plant compound with soap-like foaming action
Immunomodulating - Regulating or modifying immune function

III. Anticatarrhal

Anticatarrhal herbs help remove excess mucus from the body, particularly in the sinuses and respiratory tract. They are used for conditions like colds, sinus infections, and bronchitis. Some anticatarrhals work by thinning mucus secretions to make them easier to expel. Others may reduce overall mucus production.

The specific mechanisms are not fully understood, but anticatarrhal effects may relate to:
- Tannins - Astringent compounds that tighten tissues
- Volatile oils - With antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects  
- Flavonoids - Plant compounds with various beneficial actions

Important anticatarrhal herbs include:
- Achillea millefolium (yarrow)
- Euphrasia spp. (eyebright)
- Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal) 
- Sambucus nigra (elder)
- Thymus vulgaris (thyme)
- Verbascum thapsus (mullein)
- Eucalyptus globulus (blue gum) - introduced and naturalized in Timor-Leste
- Zingiber officinale (ginger) - cultivated in Timor-Leste

Anticatarrhal herbs often have secondary actions that enhance their effects, such as being antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, or expectorant. They are most commonly used for respiratory and sinus conditions but may also benefit other mucus membrane tissues.

Vocabulary:
Anticatarrhal - Reducing excess mucus production or accumulation
Catarrh - Excessive mucus production/congestion in air passages or cavities
Tannin - Astringent plant compound that tightens tissues
Volatile oil - Aromatic plant oil that readily evaporates 
Flavonoid - Plant pigment compound with various beneficial effects

IV. Anti-inflammatory

Anti-inflammatory herbs help combat inflammation in the body. While inflammation is a normal immune response, excessive or chronic inflammation can be harmful. Herbal anti-inflammatories offer a gentler approach than synthetic drugs, often addressing underlying causes along with symptoms.

Anti-inflammatory herbs can be grouped by their main active compounds:

1. Salicylate-containing - Similar to aspirin, good for musculoskeletal inflammation
   Examples: Salix alba (white willow), Filipendula ulmaria (meadowsweet)

2. Steroid precursors - May be metabolized into anti-inflammatory steroids  
   Examples: Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice), Dioscorea villosa (wild yam)

3. Essential oil-rich - Especially good for digestive and respiratory inflammation
   Examples: Matricaria recutita (chamomile), Calendula officinalis (calendula)

4. Resin-containing - Potent but may irritate stomach, useful for arthritis
   Examples: Boswellia serrata (frankincense), Commiphora myrrha (myrrh)
- Curcuma longa (turmeric) - widely used in Timorese cuisine and traditional medicine
- Zingiber officinale (ginger) - cultivated in Timor-Leste and used in traditional medicine

Other anti-inflammatory herbs work through various or unknown mechanisms. Anti-inflammatory herbs are used for a wide range of conditions, from arthritis to digestive issues to skin problems. They are often combined with herbs that address underlying causes of inflammation.

Vocabulary:
Anti-inflammatory - Reducing inflammation 
Salicylate - Aspirin-like compound found in some plants
Steroid - Type of hormone involved in inflammation response
Essential oil - Volatile aromatic compound from plants
Resin - Sticky aromatic plant secretion

V. Antimicrobial

Antimicrobial herbs help the body resist or destroy pathogenic microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Unlike pharmaceutical antibiotics, herbal antimicrobials often work by supporting the body's own immune defenses rather than directly killing pathogens. 

Antimicrobial herbs may work through various mechanisms:
- Direct toxic effects on microbes (e.g. volatile oils)
- Stimulating immune response 
- Blocking adhesion of pathogens to body tissues
- Altering local environment to be less hospitable to microbes

Important antimicrobial herbs include:
- Allium sativum (garlic) 
- Echinacea spp. (echinacea)
- Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal)
- Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree)
- Oreganum vulgare (oregano)
- Thymus vulgaris (thyme)
- Psidium guajava (guava) - native to Timor-Leste, leaves used traditionally as antimicrobial
- Carica papaya (papaya) - widely grown in Timor-Leste, leaves have antimicrobial properties

Antimicrobial herbs are used for various infections throughout the body. They are often combined with immune-stimulating herbs and those specific to the affected body system. While valuable for many infections, herbal antimicrobials may not be strong enough for severe systemic infections requiring antibiotics.

Vocabulary:
Antimicrobial - Acting against microbes (bacteria, fungi, viruses)
Pathogenic - Disease-causing
Volatile oil - Aromatic plant compound with antimicrobial properties
Adhesion - Process by which microbes attach to body tissues
