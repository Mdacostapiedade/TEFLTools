High-Molecular-Weight Compounds 
Many high-molecular-weight plant compounds also affect the immune system. The most important are polysaccharides and glycoproteins.

Polysaccharides
Many polysaccharides, especially glucans, have immunostimulatory properties. Glucans from mushrooms like shiitake (Lentinus edodes) and reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) can enhance immune function. Polysaccharides from herbs like astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) and echinacea (Echinacea spp.) also stimulate the immune system.

Polysaccharides found in plants from Timor-Leste and their medical effects:
- Aloe vera gel polysaccharides: Anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties
- Banana (Musa spp.) fruit polysaccharides: Potential immune-enhancing effects
- Moringa oleifera leaf polysaccharides: Immunostimulant activity

Pectic polysaccharides and arabinogalactans are found in many plants and have immunostimulant effects. Examples include angelica (Angelica acutiloba), chamomile (Matricaria recutita), and echinacea (Echinacea purpurea).

Pectic polysaccharides and arabinogalactans in plants from Timor-Leste and their medical effects:
- Papaya (Carica papaya) fruit pectin: Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties  
- Coffee (Coffea spp.) bean arabinogalactans: Potential prebiotic and immune-enhancing effects
- Tamarind (Tamarindus indica) seed polysaccharides: Immunostimulant activity

Glycoproteins
Some glycoproteins, which are proteins attached to sugars, also affect immune activity. Lectins like mistletoe lectin I from European mistletoe (Viscum album) and pokeweed mitogen from pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) have immunomodulating properties.

Glycoproteins in plants from Timor-Leste and their medical effects:
- Neem (Azadirachta indica) leaf glycoproteins: Immunostimulant and anti-inflammatory properties
- Pineapple (Ananas comosus) stem bromelain: Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects
- Papaya (Carica papaya) latex papain: Potential immunostimulant activity

Summary
In conclusion, many herbal constituents from different chemical classes modulate immune function in various ways. While alkaloids and terpenes have shown some effects, polysaccharides and glycoproteins appear to be the most active compounds.  More research is still needed to fully understand how these natural substances interact with the complex human immune system. However, traditional use of immunostimulant herbs is validated by growing scientific evidence.
