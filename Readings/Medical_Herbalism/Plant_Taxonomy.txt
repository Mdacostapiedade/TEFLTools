Classification of Medicinal Plants
Plants can be classified, or grouped, in different ways. These classifications help us understand relationships between plants and can suggest ways to research their medicinal properties. Here are some common methods for classifying medicinal plants:

Alphabetical
Plants are listed alphabetically by their scientific Latin name or common English name. This makes them easy to look up but doesn't tell us about their medicinal uses.
Latin: Alstonia scholaris, Morinda citrifolia, Tamarindus indica
English: Milky pine, Noni, Tamarind 
Tetum: Ai-rui, Mengkudu, Sukaer

Taxonomic  
Plants are grouped based on their botanical relationships - which class, order, family, genus and species they belong to, according to what botanists currently think. 
Plants in the Rubiaceae family found in Timor-Leste:
Morinda citrifolia (Noni)
Uncaria gambir (Gambier)
Coffea arabica (Coffee)

Morphologic
Plants are grouped based on shared physical features, like leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, roots, etc. Plant parts used medicinally are called "organized drugs".
Leaves: Psidium guajava (Guava) leaves
Bark: Cinnamomum verum (Cinnamon) bark
Fruits: Tamarindus indica (Tamarind) fruit

Therapeutic
There are several ways to group plants by their medicinal effects:
- Based on the actions they have on the body
  Anti-malarial: Artemisia annua (Sweet wormwood)
  Anti-diarrheal: Psidium guajava (Guava)

- By the body systems or organs they affect
  Digestive: Zingiber officinale (Ginger)
  Respiratory: Eucalyptus globulus (Eucalyptus)

- According to different medicinal traditions, like Western, Ayurvedic or Chinese 
  Erythrina variegata - used traditionally in Timor-Leste for treating fever

- By their chemical constituents
  Alstonia scholaris - contains alkaloids like echitamine

- Based on their evolutionary relationships
  Rutaceae family: Citrus species native to Southeast Asia

- By the ways different cultures around the world use them
  Areca catechu (Betel nut) - chewed traditionally in Timor-Leste
  
Plant Taxonomy and Phytotherapy
A plant's scientific name, or Latin binomial, can tell us a lot about the plant. The first part is the genus name, and the second part, the specific epithet, identifies the particular species. Botanical names are precise and recognized worldwide.

Sometimes plant names change as botanists make new discoveries. For example, the mint family was renamed from Labiatae to Lamiaceae. It's important for herbalists to know the current correct names so they can be sure which exact plant they are using.
Examples of name changes:
Papaya - formerly Carica papaya, now Vasconcellea papaya

The meaning of botanical names often reflects useful information about the plants - where they grow, what they look like, traditional uses, and the people involved in their discovery.
Tamarindus indica - "indica" refers to its origin in tropical Africa and South Asia
