Throughout the ages and across cultures, there have been individuals who have pierced the veil of ordinary consciousness and glimpsed the divine reality that lies at the heart of existence. These sages, saints, and spiritual teachers have left behind a legacy of wisdom and guidance, pointing the way to self-realization and the direct experience of the absolute. In the modern era, few have embodied this perennial quest more fully than the great Indian masters Ramakrishna, Anandamayi Ma, Papaji, and Bhagawan Nityananda, and their contemporary Western disciple, Gangaji.
Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the 19th-century Bengali mystic, is perhaps best known for his ecstatic devotion to the Divine Mother Kali and his embrace of multiple spiritual paths. Born into a poor Brahmin family, Ramakrishna showed signs of spiritual inclination from a young age, often falling into states of divine absorption and trance. As a priest at the Dakshineswar Kali Temple, he immersed himself in the worship of the Mother Goddess, practicing intense spiritual disciplines and experiencing profound visions and realizations.
Yet Ramakrishna's spirituality was not limited to any one tradition or dogma. He explored and mastered the practices of Tantra, Advaita Vedanta, Vaishnava bhakti, and even Islam and Christianity, declaring that all paths lead ultimately to the same goal. "As many faiths, so many paths," he famously said. For Ramakrishna, the Divine could take many forms and be approached in many ways, but the essence was always the same: the realization of the true Self, the unchanging reality behind the changing appearances of the world.
This message of spiritual universalism and the primacy of direct experience over dogma or doctrine was carried forward by Ramakrishna's chief disciple, Swami Vivekananda, who brought the teachings of Vedanta to the West and helped spark a global spiritual renaissance. But it was also embodied in the life and teachings of another great Indian saint of the 20th century, Sri Anandamayi Ma.
Born in 1896 in present-day Bangladesh, Anandamayi Ma (born Nirmala Sundari) was a spiritual prodigy who spontaneously entered states of divine ecstasy and absorption from a young age. Married at the age of 13, she continued to pursue her spiritual practices and soon attracted a following of devotees drawn to her profound states of bliss and her unconditional love and compassion for all beings.
Like Ramakrishna, Anandamayi Ma emphasized the importance of direct spiritual experience over intellectual knowledge or religious formalism. "Book learning is of no avail," she declared. "One should study the great scripture of the Self, which is within." She also stressed the unity of all spiritual paths and the ultimate oneness of the individual soul with the divine. "Where is God and where is He not?" she would ask. "He is everywhere, within and without."
This non-dual perspective, which sees the Divine as the sole reality and the individual self as ultimately illusory, was also at the heart of the teachings of H.W.L. Poonja, better known as Papaji. Born in Punjab in 1910, Papaji had a series of powerful spiritual experiences as a young man, culminating in a transformative encounter with the great sage Ramana Maharshi.
Under Ramana's guidance, Papaji discovered the truth of his own divine nature and the illusory nature of the ego and the phenomenal world. He spent the rest of his life sharing this realization with spiritual seekers from around the world, emphasizing the simplicity and immediacy of self-inquiry and the recognition of one's true identity as pure awareness.
"You are already free," Papaji would tell his students. "You are the Self, the unchanging witness of all that arises and passes away. Just be quiet and know that you are God." Like Ramakrishna and Anandamayi Ma, Papaji stressed the primacy of direct experience and the futility of intellectual understanding or spiritual seeking. "Liberation is not something to be achieved," he declared. "It is your natural state, your birthright."
This message of the inherent perfection and divinity of the Self was also at the core of the teachings of Bhagawan Nityananda, another great Indian master of the 20th century. Born in South India in 1897, Nityananda displayed signs of spiritual realization from a young age and spent much of his early life wandering and practicing intense austerities.
Later, as a guru and spiritual teacher, Nityananda emphasized the path of self-surrender and the recognition of the Divine in all things. "The whole world is permeated by God," he taught. "He is within you and without you. He is the reality behind all experiences, the unchanging substratum of all that exists."
Like his predecessors, Nityananda stressed the importance of spiritual practice and the cultivation of devotion and self-inquiry. But he also emphasized the ultimate futility of all efforts and the need for complete surrender to the Divine will. "The greatest obstacle to realization is the belief that you are the doer," he declared. "Give up all efforts and simply be."
In the contemporary spiritual landscape, few have embodied and transmitted the wisdom of these great Indian masters more directly than the American-born teacher Gangaji. Born Antoinette Roberson Varner in Texas in 1942, Gangaji had a successful career as an actress and model before a series of personal crises led her to the spiritual path.
In 1990, she met H.W.L. Poonja in India and underwent a profound awakening to her true nature as pure awareness. Since then, she has traveled the world sharing the simple yet profound message of self-inquiry and the recognition of one's inherent freedom and wholeness.
Like her teacher Papaji and the other great masters in this lineage, Gangaji emphasizes the immediacy and simplicity of self-realization. "Stoppracticingng your search, your seeking, and your waiting," she urges. "Recognize what is already here, what is already whole, what is already free."
At the same time, Gangaji acknowledges the challenges and obstacles that arise on the spiritual path, the deeply ingrained habits of identification with the body, mind, and ego. "Self-realization is not a state of bliss or peace or happiness," she notes. "It is a state of being, a recognition of what is always present, beyond the fluctuations of experience."
In this, Gangaji echoes the perennial wisdom of the sages and saints who have come before her, from Ramakrishna and Anandamayi Ma to Papaji and Nityananda. For all their differences in background, culture, and spiritual style, these great teachers point to the same essential truth: that the Divine is not something to be sought or attained, but the very reality of our own being.
Whether through the ecstatic devotion of Ramakrishna, the blissful absorption of Anandamayi Ma, the fierce self-inquiry of Papaji, the radical surrender of Nityananda, or the direct pointing of Gangaji, the invitation is the same: to awaken to our true nature as pure, boundless awareness, to recognize the inherent perfection and divinity of all that is.
In a world that often seems fragmented and divided, this message of spiritual unity and the possibility of direct realization is more urgent than ever. As Ramakrishna put it over a century ago: "The winds of grace are always blowing, but you have to raise the sail." May the words and the presence of these great teachers, these embodiments of perennial wisdom, inspire and guide us on our own journey of awakening, now and in all the moments to come.
