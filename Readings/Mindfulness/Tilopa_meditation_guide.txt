# Meditation Guide Based on Tilopa's Six Words of Advice

## Introduction

Tilopa, the 10th-century Indian Buddhist master, distilled the essence of meditation practice into six profound words. In Tibetan, these words form a concise instruction that has been translated in various ways. We'll explore two translations:

1. "Don't recall. Don't imagine. Don't think. Don't examine. Don't control. Rest."
2. "Let go of what has passed. Let go of what may come. Let go of what is happening now. Don't try to figure anything out. Don't try to make anything happen. Relax, right now, and rest."

This guide will break down each of these points and provide practical instructions for meditation based on Tilopa's wisdom.

## Final Thoughts

Tilopa's advice encourages us to let go of our habitual tendencies to manipulate our experience and instead rest in the natural state of mind. This practice can lead to profound insights and a deep sense of peace. Remember, the goal is not to achieve any particular state, but to become familiar with the mind as it is, free from our usual conceptual overlays.

As you continue to practice, you may find that these instructions become less like steps to follow and more like reminders of your mind's natural state. The ultimate aim is to rest effortlessly in this state of open awareness throughout all your activities.
