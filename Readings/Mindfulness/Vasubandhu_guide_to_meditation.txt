# Meditation Instructions Based on Vasubandhu's Six Steps of Breathing Meditation

## Introduction

These meditation instructions are based on the six steps of breathing meditation according to Vasubandhu, as well as various common treatises on his texts. Meditation on the breath pacifies afflictive emotions, especially discursive thinking, thereby increasing our ability to focus not only on the breath but also on other objects of observation.

The object chosen, the breath, is natural and available to all, everywhere, at all times. By focusing the mind on this object, it will slowly become calm and relaxed. Vasubandhu says, "Mindfulness of exhalation and inhalation of the breath is wisdom because wisdom occurs by generation of the force of mindfulness."

According to Vasubandhu, mindfulness of breathing is perfected when it is endowed with six operations:
1. Counting
2. Following
3. Fixing
4. Observing or investigating
5. Modifying
6. Purifying

Therefore, we will practice mindfulness of breathing by focusing on these six aspects of the breathing process.

## The Six Steps of Breathing Meditation

### 1. Counting

Begin by placing the attention on the in-breathing and out-breathing without effort. Let the body and mind be at ease. When I stop talking, we will simply count the breaths from one to ten in the mind. Do not count to less than 10 or more than 10 in order to avoid tension and mental distraction. If, in the course of this cultivation, the mind becomes distracted, one should count anew from the beginning until absorption or samadhi is attained.

Now, withdraw the mind inside and count the breaths from 1 to 10 single-pointedly, without confusing the order or becoming distracted. Continue to observe and count the breaths from 1 to 10.

### 2. Following

Once the mind becomes more quiet and tranquil, we move on to the second step, which is to watch and follow the breathing. Follow the inhalation as it moves in from the beginning of the breath into the throat, then the navel, and so on all the way down to both feet. Then follow the exhalation as it moves outward. Stay with your attention alert yet relaxed in order to stay with the movement of the breath and follow it. Observe and recognize where the breath goes in the body. Continue to observe and watch the inhalation and exhalation of the breath, following its rhythmic movement.

### 3. Fixing

For the third stage of this mindfulness of breathing practice, fix or place your attention on the tip of the nose, between the eyebrows, or in another area of the body of your choosing down to the toes of the feet. Fix the mind. See the breath held in the body like the thread of a pearl necklace, noticing if it is hot or cold, pleasant or unpleasant. At this stage, we are noticing the feeling and sensation accompanying the movement of the breath throughout the body. We practice this mindfulness of breathing with an attention to things as they really are, as things are presenting themselves in this very moment, without hoping or wishing things to be different, without seeking for anything.

### 4. Observing or Investigating

For the fourth stage of this meditation, we now move to observing or investigation that reveals deeper truths about the nature of this body-mind. As the mind becomes more pacified, we begin to notice that within this fathom-long body, there's not only the breath, the movement of air, but we begin to look and investigate the four primary elements and the five aggregates, their nature and what they constitute within this body. This stage of the practice moves us into the vipassana or insight practice.

We investigate and analyze with a contemplative state of mind all the four elements and five aggregates:

#### The Four Elements:
1. Earth Element: Notice and feel its characteristics within the body of hardness, solidity, and resistance.
2. Water Element: Experience its particular characteristics of fluidity, moisture, wetness, and cohesion.
3. Fire Element: Notice how it manifests throughout your body, the characteristics of temperature, warmth, and the energy of combustion within the digestive system.
4. Air Element: Notice the main characteristic of the in and out breath, the outgoing and downward-moving winds of the body, and the quality of extension and movement.

#### The Five Aggregates (Skandhas):
1. Material Form: This very body is material form, and its physicality is just these four elements in play.
2. Feeling Tone: Notice that every conscious experience, whether physical or mental, has a feeling tone of either pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
3. Perception: Notice how with every conscious experience there is perception, a mental designation, a memory, or mental label. For example, seeing a color, perception labels it as blue or red; hearing a sound, the mind labels it a dog or a bird.
4. Mental Formations: Notice the thinking activity of mind, the conceptual constructions that take place.
5. Sense Consciousness: Notice that each of the sense doors has moments of cognition that arise through the eyes seeing a form, ears hearing a sound, nose smelling an odor, tongue tasting a flavor, body touching a tangible object, or the mind cognizing a mind object.

### 5. Modifying

For the fifth stage of this practice, modifying, one now modifies the mind that had the breath and body as its primary object of attention and now directs the mind to meditation on impermanence. We can notice and analyze how the breath changes consistently and continuously from moment to moment, and thus we begin to recognize and notice the truth of impermanence (anicca).

We can investigate the impermanence of all these five aggregates, observing their arising and ceasing in our direct experience. Seeing clearly like this gives rise to insight. Passionate, consistent, and sustained observation of the impermanence of the five aggregates leads to the elimination of the five mental hindrances or obstacles: sensual desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt.

As we continue to deepen our contemplation of the arising, continuation, and ceasing of all phenomena, one sees that all phenomena are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self. Furthermore, the insights into these three characteristics of existence of all phenomena through this meditation practice give rise to the states of dispassion, cessation, and the relinquishment of attachment.

Following these deep insights and understandings, the meditator enters the path of seeing and the path of meditation, known as purifying. With correct practice based on Right View, the mind is transformed into the paths of seeing and meditation.

### 6. Purifying

The sixth stage encompasses the practice of the four fields or foundations of mindfulness, which lead to the uprooting and eradication of the afflicted emotions and the attainment of the wholesome roots. This happens through wisdom itself doing the work. Right View arises from the work done in the consistent application of this meditation practice, a culmination of the Eightfold Noble Path and a realizing of the Four Noble Truths.

## Conclusion

This is the way of cultivation that will bring ever-deepening insight and lead one onto the full Liberation or Awakening the Buddha pointed to. In essence, there is direct realization of emptiness, the eradication of the unwholesome roots, the cessation of clinging, and the ending of suffering.
