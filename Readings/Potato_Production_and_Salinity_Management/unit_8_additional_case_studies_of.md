Case studies of successful potato farmers managing salinity in Timor-Leste

1. Maria da Costa - Aileu District

Background:
- Small-scale farmer with 2 hectares
- Faced increasing salinity due to improper irrigation practices

Strategies implemented:
- Installed drip irrigation system
- Implemented raised bed planting
- Used gypsum as a soil amendment
- Adopted salt-tolerant potato varieties

Results:
- 40% increase in yield over 3 years
- Reduced water usage by 30%
- Improved soil structure and decreased soil EC

2. João Soares - Ermera District

Background:
- Medium-sized farm of 5 hectares
- High water table contributing to salinity issues

Strategies implemented:
- Installed subsurface drainage system
- Practiced crop rotation with legumes
- Used organic mulch to reduce evaporation
- Implemented precision fertilizer application

Results:
- 50% reduction in soil salinity levels
- 35% increase in potato quality (fewer defects)
- Diversified income through rotation crops

3. Ana Pereira - Ainaro District

Background:
- Cooperative farm manager overseeing 10 hectares
- Coastal area with saline irrigation water

Strategies implemented:
- Constructed rainwater harvesting system
- Blended saline water with harvested freshwater
- Implemented leaching irrigation practices
- Used potassium-rich organic fertilizers

Results:
- Maintained consistent yields despite increasing regional salinity
- Reduced dependence on saline groundwater by 60%
- Improved overall soil health and microbial activity

4. Carlos Gusmão - Bobonaro District

Background:
- Large-scale farmer with 15 hectares
- Dealing with secondary salinization from intensive farming

Strategies implemented:
- Adopted conservation tillage practices
- Used salt-tolerant cover crops between seasons
- Implemented site-specific management using GIS
- Installed soil moisture sensors for precise irrigation

Results:
- 25% increase in water use efficiency
- Reversed soil degradation trends
- Achieved premium prices for high-quality potatoes

5. Lucia Mendes - Manufahi District

Background:
- Young farmer starting with 1 hectare
- Inherited land with severe salinity issues

Strategies implemented:
- Phytoremediation using salt-accumulating plants
- Integrated livestock for manure production
- Used biochar as a soil amendment
- Implemented agroforestry techniques on field borders

Results:
- Reclaimed 80% of land for productive use within 5 years
- Established additional income streams (livestock, fruit trees)
- Became a local leader in sustainable salinity management

Common Success Factors:
1. Adoption of water-efficient irrigation systems
2. Use of organic matter and appropriate soil amendments
3. Selection of salt-tolerant potato varieties
4. Implementation of integrated soil and water management practices
5. Continuous monitoring and adaptive management
6. Participation in farmer training programs and extension services
7. Diversification of crops and income sources
8. Investment in soil health as a long-term strategy

Challenges Overcome:
1. Limited access to technology and inputs
2. Initial high costs of implementing new systems
3. Lack of local expertise in salinity management
4. Cultural resistance to changing traditional practices
5. Variability in climate and water availability

Lessons Learned:
1. Importance of tailoring strategies to local conditions
2. Value of combining traditional knowledge with modern techniques
3. Necessity of long-term planning and patience in seeing results
4. Benefits of farmer-to-farmer knowledge sharing
5. Critical role of ongoing education and capacity building

Future Directions:
1. Scaling up successful practices to larger areas
2. Developing local supply chains for necessary inputs
3. Establishing farmer cooperatives for shared resources
4. Integrating climate-smart agriculture principles
5. Exploring value-added processing for salt-stressed potatoes
