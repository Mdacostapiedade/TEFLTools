III. Animals Commonly Used for Fertility in Timor-Leste

Introduction:
Timor-Leste's agriculture is characterized by smallholder farming systems where livestock plays a crucial role in livelihood strategies and soil fertility management. This guide explores the various animals commonly used for fertility in Timor-Leste, focusing on their manure production, composition, and specific benefits for soil health and farm productivity.

A. Cattle

In Timor-Leste, both indigenous Bali cattle and introduced breeds like Brahman are common. Cattle are valued for their draft power, meat, and significant contribution to soil fertility.

1. Manure Production and Composition:

Production:
- An adult cow produces approximately 20-30 kg of manure per day.
- Annual production: 7-11 tons per animal.

Composition (average values):
- Nitrogen (N): 0.5-1.5%
- Phosphorus (P): 0.1-0.5%
- Potassium (K): 0.5-1.0%
- Organic Matter: 16-20%

Nutrient availability:
- Slow-release nature, ideal for Timor-Leste's tropical soils prone to nutrient leaching.
- About 30-50% of N becomes available in the first year after application.

Application rates:
- For maize: 5-10 tons/ha can significantly increase yields.
- For vegetable gardens: 15-20 tons/ha provides excellent fertility.

2. Grazing Management for Soil Health:

Benefits:
- Improves nutrient cycling in pastures and fallow lands.
- Enhances soil structure through hoof action, breaking soil crusts.
- Increases organic matter through manure and trampled vegetation.

Grazing strategies for Timor-Leste:
a) Rotational grazing:
   - Divide pastures into paddocks, rotate cattle every 1-2 weeks.
   - Allows grass recovery, prevents overgrazing.
   - Particularly useful in hilly areas to prevent erosion.

b) Stubble grazing:
   - Graze cattle on crop residues after harvest (e.g., maize fields).
   - Enhances nutrient cycling, adds manure directly to crop fields.

c) Tethered grazing:
   - Common practice in smallholdings.
   - Move tethering points regularly to distribute manure evenly.

Challenges and solutions:
- Overgrazing: Implement strict rotations, especially in dry season.
- Erosion on steep slopes: Practice contour grazing, maintain vegetation cover.

B. Poultry

Chickens and, to a lesser extent, ducks are common in Timor-Leste's backyard farming systems.

1. High-Nitrogen Manure:

Production:
- A laying hen produces about 0.1-0.15 kg of manure per day.
- 100 chickens can produce approximately 4-5 tons of manure annually.

Composition:
- Nitrogen (N): 3-5%
- Phosphorus (P): 1.5-3.5%
- Potassium (K): 1.5-2.5%
- Very high in available nutrients compared to other manures.

Application:
- Must be composted before application to avoid "burning" plants.
- Excellent for vegetables: apply 2-3 tons/ha of composted chicken manure.
- For maize: 1-2 tons/ha can significantly boost yields.

Local practice: 
- Mix chicken manure with rice hulls or coffee pulp for composting.
- Use as a top dressing for vegetables, applying around plants in small amounts.

2. Pest Control Benefits:

- Chickens scratch and eat insects, larvae, and weed seeds.
- Effective in controlling pests in coffee plantations and vegetable gardens.

Implementation:
a) Coffee plantations:
   - Allow chickens to forage under coffee trees.
   - Can help control coffee berry borer and other pests.

b) Vegetable gardens:
   - Rotate chickens through garden beds between crops.
   - Reduces pest populations and adds fertility.

c) Fruit orchards:
   - Chickens can control fruit flies and other orchard pests.

Considerations:
- Protect young plants and seedlings from scratching.
- Provide shade and water for chickens in foraging areas.

C. Sheep and Goats

Goats are more common than sheep in Timor-Leste, well-adapted to the hilly terrain.

1. Manure Benefits:

Production:
- A goat produces about 1-1.5 kg of manure per day.
- Annual production: 365-550 kg per goat.

Composition:
- Nitrogen (N): 1.5-2%
- Phosphorus (P): 0.3-0.6%
- Potassium (K): 1.8-2.5%
- Higher in nutrients compared to cattle manure.

Application:
- Excellent for vegetable gardens and fruit trees.
- Apply 5-10 tons/ha for significant yield improvements.

Local use:
- Often collected from night enclosures and applied to nearby gardens.
- Can be composted with crop residues for better nutrient balance.

2. Weed Management through Grazing:

Benefits:
- Goats prefer browsing on shrubs and woody plants.
- Effective in controlling weeds in fallow lands and plantations.

Strategies:
a) Plantation weed control:
   - Graze goats in young rubber or coconut plantations to control undergrowth.
   - Careful management needed to prevent damage to young trees.

b) Fallow land improvement:
   - Goat grazing can control invasive species and promote grass growth.
   - Enhances soil fertility for future cropping.

c) Firebreak maintenance:
   - Use goats to keep firebreaks clear of vegetation.

Considerations:
- Rotate grazing areas to prevent overgrazing.
- Provide supplementary feed during dry seasons.

D. Pigs

Pigs are an important part of Timor-Leste's rural economy, often raised in small numbers by households.

1. Manure Characteristics:

Production:
- A growing pig produces about 2-3 kg of manure per day.
- Annual production: 700-1000 kg per pig.

Composition:
- Nitrogen (N): 0.5-1%
- Phosphorus (P): 0.3-0.5%
- Potassium (K): 0.3-0.5%
- High in organic matter and moisture content.

Application:
- Best composted before application due to high moisture content.
- Excellent for improving soil structure and water retention.
- Apply 10-15 tons/ha for significant soil improvement.

Local practice:
- Often used in home gardens and small-scale vegetable production.
- Mix with dry materials like rice hulls or dried leaves for composting.

2. Tillage Effects through Rooting Behavior:

Benefits:
- Pig rooting can till the soil, incorporating organic matter.
- Can help prepare land for planting, reducing manual labor.

Implementation:
a) Fallow land improvement:
   - Allow pigs to root in fallow fields before cropping.
   - Enhances soil aeration and organic matter incorporation.

b) Orchard floor management:
   - Controlled pig rooting can manage weeds and incorporate fallen fruit.
   - Careful management needed to prevent damage to tree roots.

Considerations:
- Limit rooting time to prevent excessive soil disturbance.
- Use nose rings if necessary to control rooting depth.

E. Other Animals

1. Rabbits:
- Produce small pellets high in N and P.
- Excellent for vegetable gardens and nurseries.
- Easy to collect and apply directly without composting.

2. Ducks:
- Manure is high in N, similar to chicken manure.
- Effective for pest control in rice paddies.
- Can be integrated into aquaculture systems.

3. Buffalo:
- Similar to cattle in manure production and composition.
- Valuable for draft power in rice cultivation.
- Manure collected from night enclosures can be applied to nearby fields.

Conclusion:

The integration of animals for soil fertility management in Timor-Leste offers numerous benefits, including improved soil health, enhanced nutrient cycling, and increased farm productivity. By understanding the specific characteristics and benefits of different animal manures, farmers can optimize their use in various agricultural systems.

Key considerations for Timor-Leste:
1. Composting: Essential for most animal manures to improve nutrient availability and reduce potential negative impacts.
2. Integration with cropping systems: Align animal management with crop cycles for maximum benefit.
3. Erosion control: Careful grazing management on steep slopes to prevent soil erosion.
4. Cultural practices: Consider traditional animal management practices and integrate improved techniques sensitively.
5. Diversification: Encourage a mix of animals to benefit from varied manure types and multiple products.

By leveraging the benefits of animal integration for soil fertility, Timorese farmers can build more resilient, productive, and sustainable farming systems, contributing to improved food security and rural livelihoods.
