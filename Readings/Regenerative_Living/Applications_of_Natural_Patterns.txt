# Handout: Natural Patterns and Their Applications

## Common Natural Patterns:
1. Spiral: Found in shells, galaxies, and plant growth; allows for efficient use of space and resources
2. Branching: Seen in trees, rivers, and blood vessels; enables efficient distribution and collection
3. Waves: Observed in water, sand dunes, and sound; facilitates energy transfer and erosion control
4. Tessellations: Visible in honeycombs, snake scales, and tile patterns; allows for compact, interlocking arrangements

## Applications in Permaculture Design:
1. Spiral: Use spiral patterns in garden beds, water catchment systems, and animal enclosures to maximize space and efficiency
2. Branching: Incorporate branching patterns in irrigation systems, pathways, and plant guilds to optimize distribution and flow
3. Waves: Apply wave patterns in earthworks, such as swales and berms, to slow and spread water flow and prevent erosion
4. Tessellations: Utilize tessellating patterns in paving, planting arrangements, and animal housing to create compact, interlocking designs

When designing with natural patterns, consider the specific needs and context of your site, and how the patterns can enhance the function and resilience of your system. Observe the patterns in nature around you and adapt them to your unique circumstances.
