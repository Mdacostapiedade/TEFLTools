## Introduction

Aquaponics is a sustainable method of food production that combines aquaculture (raising aquatic animals) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water). This guide will walk you through the process of setting up an aquaponics system tailored for the unique conditions of Timor-Leste. By following these steps, you'll be able to create a system that provides both fish and vegetables, using minimal water and space.

## Understanding Aquaponics

Before we dive into the construction process, it's essential to understand the basic principles of aquaponics:

1. Fish produce waste that contains ammonia.
2. Beneficial bacteria convert ammonia to nitrites, then to nitrates.
3. Plants absorb nitrates and other nutrients, cleaning the water.
4. Clean water is returned to the fish tank.

This cycle creates a mutually beneficial ecosystem where fish, plants, and bacteria work together to create a balanced environment.

### Benefits of Aquaponics in Timor-Leste

Aquaponics offers several advantages that make it particularly suitable for Timor-Leste:

- Water conservation: Aquaponics uses up to 90% less water than traditional agriculture.
- Space efficiency: Systems can be built vertically, maximizing production in small areas.
- Sustainable protein source: Fish provide a valuable protein source alongside vegetables.
- Reduced reliance on soil quality: Ideal for areas with poor soil conditions.
- Year-round production: With proper management, systems can produce food throughout the year.

## Planning Your Aquaponics System

Before you start building, it's crucial to plan your system carefully. Consider the following factors:

### System Size

Determine the size of your system based on:

- Available space
- Your food production goals
- Number of people you want to feed
- Time you can dedicate to maintenance

For beginners in Timor-Leste, we recommend starting with a small to medium-sized system, around 1000 liters (264 gallons) of total water volume. This size is manageable for a family and allows for learning without overwhelming resources.

### System Type

There are three main types of aquaponics systems:

1. Media-based: Plants grow in beds filled with media like gravel or expanded clay pebbles.
2. Deep Water Culture (DWC): Plants float on rafts in deep channels of water.
3. Nutrient Film Technique (NFT): Plants grow in long, narrow channels with a thin film of water flowing through.

For Timor-Leste, we recommend starting with a media-based system. It's the most forgiving for beginners and works well with a variety of plants.

### Components Needed

Make a list of all components you'll need:

- Fish tank
- Grow beds
- Plumbing (pipes, fittings, valves)
- Pump
- Air pump and air stones
- Grow media
- Fish
- Plants
- Water test kit
- Tools for construction

### Budget

Create a detailed budget for your system. In Timor-Leste, some materials may need to be imported, so factor in shipping costs. Look for local alternatives where possible to reduce expenses.

## Choosing a Location

Selecting the right location for your aquaponics system is crucial for its success. Consider the following factors:

### Sunlight

Most vegetables need 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. In Timor-Leste's tropical climate, some shade during the hottest part of the day can be beneficial. Choose a spot that gets morning sun and afternoon shade if possible.

### Protection from Elements

Your system needs protection from:

- Heavy rains: Avoid areas prone to flooding.
- Strong winds: High winds can damage plants and increase water evaporation.
- Extreme heat: Consider using shade cloth during the hottest months.

### Accessibility

Ensure the location is easily accessible for:

- Daily feeding and monitoring
- Harvesting fish and vegetables
- System maintenance

### Stability

The ground should be level and stable to support the weight of your system. A concrete slab or compacted earth works well.

### Proximity to Power and Water

Your system will need:

- Electrical outlet for the pump and aeration system
- Access to clean water for topping up the system

### Security

Consider fencing or locating the system where it can be monitored to prevent theft or vandalism.

## Selecting System Components

Now that you've chosen a location, it's time to select and acquire the components for your aquaponics system. Here's a detailed breakdown of what you'll need:

Proper aeration will ensure your fish have enough oxygen and promote the growth of beneficial bacteria throughout your system.

## Cycling the System

Cycling is the process of establishing beneficial bacteria in your aquaponics system. This is crucial for converting fish waste into plant nutrients. Here's how to cycle your system:

### Step 1: Prepare the System

1. Ensure all components are installed and functioning:
   - Fish tank
   - Grow beds with media
   - Plumbing
   - Pump
   - Aeration

2. Fill the system with water:
   - Use dechlorinated water if using municipal water supply.
   - Rainwater or well water can be used directly if clean.

3. Start the pump and aeration systems.

### Step 2: Introduce Ammonia

You have two options:

#### Option A: Fishless Cycling (Recommended for beginners)

1. Add a source of ammonia to the water:
   - Use pure ammonia (free of additives) from a hardware store.
   - Add enough to reach 2-4 ppm (parts per million) of ammonia.
   - Alternatively, use fish food or natural sources like fresh grass clippings.

2. Test ammonia levels daily and add more as needed to maintain 2-4 ppm.

#### Option B: Fish-In Cycling

1. Introduce a small number of hardy fish (about 20% of your planned final stock).
2. Feed very sparingly to prevent ammonia spikes.

### Step 3: Monitor Water Parameters

1. Invest in a good quality water test kit.
2. Test daily for:
   - Ammonia (NH3)
   - Nitrite (NO2)
   - Nitrate (NO3)
   - pH

3. Keep a log of your readings.

### Step 4: Observe the Cycling Process

The cycle typically progresses as follows:

1. Ammonia levels rise
2. Nitrite levels begin to rise as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria establish
3. Ammonia levels start to drop
4. Nitrite levels peak and then start to drop as nitrite-oxidizing bacteria establish
5. Nitrate levels begin to rise

### Step 5: Maintain pH

1. Keep pH between 6.8-7.2 for optimal bacterial growth.
2. If pH drops, add small amounts of calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) or potassium hydroxide.
3. Add slowly and in small amounts to avoid rapid pH changes.

### Step 6: Maintain Temperature

1. Keep water temperature between 20-30°C (68-86°F).
2. Use a heater if necessary during cooler periods.

### Step 7: Add Plants (Optional)

1. Once nitrates are detectable, you can add some hardy plants to the system.
2. Fast-growing plants like lettuce or spinach can help absorb nitrates.

### Step 8: Complete the Cycle

1. The cycle is complete when you can add ammonia to 1 ppm and it's converted to nitrate within 24 hours.
2. This usually takes 3-6 weeks, but can vary.

### Step 9: Prepare for Fish

1. Do a 20% water change before adding fish.
2. Ensure ammonia and nitrite levels are at 0 ppm.
3. Nitrate should be less than 40 ppm.

Your system is now cycled and ready for fish and plants!

## Introducing Fish

Once your system is cycled, it's time to add fish. Here's how to do it safely:

### Step 1: Choose Your Fish

For Timor-Leste's climate, consider:

1. Tilapia: Hardy and fast-growing
2. Catfish: Adaptable to various conditions
3. Carp: Omnivorous and suited to warm climates
4. Jade Perch: Thrives in tropical conditions

### Step 2: Calculate Stocking Density

1. For beginners, start with a low density: about 1 fish per 20 liters of fish tank volume.
2. For a 330-liter fish tank (in a 1000-liter system), start with about 15-20 fish.

### Step 3: Prepare for Fish Arrival

1. Ensure water parameters are stable:
   - Ammonia: 0 ppm
   - Nitrite: 0 ppm
   - Nitrate: <40 ppm
   - pH: 6.8-7.2
   - Temperature: Appropriate for your chosen species

2. Set up a quarantine tank if possible to observe fish before adding to main system.

### Step 4: Acclimate the Fish

1. Float the sealed bag of fish in your tank for 15-20 minutes to equalize temperature.
2. Open the bag and add small amounts of your tank water every 5 minutes.
3. After 30 minutes, use a net to transfer fish to your tank, discarding the bag water.

### Step 5: Observe Fish Behavior

1. Watch for signs of stress: rapid
 breathing, hiding, or erratic swimming.
2. Ensure all fish are swimming normally and not gasping at the surface.

### Step 6: Begin Feeding Routine

1. Wait 24 hours before first feeding to allow fish to acclimate.
2. Start with small amounts of food, about 1% of fish body weight per day.
3. Divide into 2-3 feedings throughout the day.
4. Remove any uneaten food after 5 minutes to prevent water fouling.

### Step 7: Monitor Water Quality Closely

1. Test water parameters daily for the first week:
