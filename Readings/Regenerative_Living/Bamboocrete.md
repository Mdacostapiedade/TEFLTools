# Introduction

Bamboocrete is a sustainable alternative to conventional steel-reinforced concrete. It replaces the steel reinforcement bars with bamboo, taking advantage of bamboo's high tensile strength. Bamboocrete also incorporates oil palm kernel shells (PKS) as a partial replacement for regular concrete aggregate, creating a lightweight concrete mix. 

The combination of bamboo reinforcement and PKS lightweight concrete in bamboocrete offers several benefits:

- Reduced construction costs 
- Lighter weight panels and structures
- Improved sustainability by using renewable bamboo and agricultural waste PKS
- Suitable for earthquake and hurricane prone areas due to bamboocrete's flexibility

This guide covers the practical use and production of bamboocrete multi-purpose panels.

# Materials

## Bamboo

The most suitable bamboo species for bamboocrete in Malaysia and globally is Gigantochloa Scortechinii, commonly known as Semantan bamboo. For construction use, harvest mature bamboo poles that are 3-4 years old with a diameter of around 53 mm ± 10 mm.

Treat the harvested bamboo by soaking in a borax and boric acid solution for two weeks. This protects against insects and fungal decay. After treatment, dry the bamboo poles under a shed for four weeks.

## Concrete Mix

Bamboocrete uses a lightweight concrete mix that partially replaces regular coarse aggregate with oil palm kernel shells (PKS). PKS is an agricultural waste product that is abundantly available. Using PKS reduces the weight and cost of the concrete.

A typical bamboocrete mix proportion for a 16 MPa compressive strength concrete is:

- Cement: 526 kg/m³ 
- PKS (coarse aggregate): 263 kg/m³
- Regular coarse aggregate: 526 kg/m³
- Fine aggregate (sand): 263 kg/m³ 
- Water: 526 kg/m³
- Superplasticizer (optional): 5.26 kg/m³

Adjust the mix proportions based on the desired strength and locally available materials. Conduct trial mixes to optimize strength and workability.

# Panel Production

Bamboocrete is well-suited for prefabrication of multi-purpose panels. A typical panel size is 1500 mm × 300 mm × 125 mm. Follow these steps to produce bamboocrete panels:

1. Cut the treated and dried bamboo poles to the required length (e.g. 1500 mm for a 1500 mm tall panel). Use poles with a diameter of around 53 mm.

2. Tie 4 bamboo poles together with wire. Wrap the bundle with wire mesh to improve bonding with the concrete. Position the bamboo bundle inside the panel formwork mold. 

3. Prepare the PKS lightweight concrete mix. Pour the concrete into the mold and vibrate to remove air pockets. The bamboo bundle should be completely encased in concrete.

4. Cure the bamboocrete panels for 28 days. Water cure or cover with plastic sheeting to prevent moisture loss.

5. Remove the panels from the molds after initial curing. Handle carefully as the panels gain full strength after 28 days.

# Structural Performance

Bamboocrete multi-purpose panels with dimensions of 1500 mm × 300 mm × 125 mm can achieve:

- Axial load capacity over 100 kN (10 tons)  
- Flexural bending load of 32-35 kN

The panels exhibit good flexibility under loading. They can deform without breaking and return to their original shape after load removal. This property makes bamboocrete suitable for structures in earthquake and hurricane prone regions.

Conduct structural testing on sample panels to verify their load capacities. Consult with a structural engineer to design bamboocrete structures appropriately.

# Cost Analysis

Using bamboo reinforcement and PKS lightweight concrete can significantly reduce the cost of bamboocrete panels compared to conventional steel reinforced concrete panels:

- A 1500 mm × 500 mm × 125 mm bamboocrete panel costs approximately RM 69, while an equivalent steel reinforced concrete panel costs RM 80. 
- Bamboocrete panels are around 14% cheaper.
- Bamboocrete panels are also 23% lighter, weighing 142 kg compared to 186 kg for a steel reinforced panel.

The cost savings are attributed to:

1. Replacing expensive steel reinforcement with low-cost bamboo 
2. Reducing the amount of concrete needed by using bamboo as partial spacers
3. Utilizing waste PKS as a lightweight aggregate, which is cheaper than regular aggregate

Actual costs will vary based on local material prices and labor costs. However, the use of bamboo and PKS in bamboocrete consistently reduces expenses.

# Environmental Impact

Bamboocrete offers significant environmental benefits compared to regular steel-reinforced concrete:

- Bamboo is a fast-growing, renewable resource. It can be harvested every 3-4 years without damaging the plant. In contrast, steel production is energy-intensive and relies on non-renewable iron ore.

- Using waste PKS in the concrete mix diverts this material from landfills or open burning. It reduces the need for environmentally-damaging aggregate mining.

- The lower weight of bamboocrete panels and structures reduces the energy needed for transportation and assembly.

- Bamboocrete's flexibility and crack resistance can increase the longevity of structures, minimizing reconstruction needs.

Consider conducting a life cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify the environmental impacts and benefits of bamboocrete for specific projects.

# Applications

Bamboocrete's low cost, sustainability, and good structural properties make it suitable for various applications:

- Low-cost housing: Bamboocrete panels can be used for walls, floors, and roofs in affordable residential projects. The light weight reduces foundation requirements.

- Disaster-resistant structures: The flexibility of bamboocrete is advantageous in earthquake and hurricane prone areas. Properly designed bamboocrete buildings can withstand these hazards better than rigid concrete structures.  

- Temporary structures: Bamboocrete panels are easily transported and assembled for temporary applications like emergency shelters, construction site offices, and event pavilions.

- Sustainable construction: Where environmental impact is a key concern, such as in eco-resorts, nature reserves, and green buildings, bamboocrete offers a low-carbon, renewable alternative to conventional concrete.

- Interior design: Lightweight bamboocrete panels can be used to create unique interior elements like room dividers, feature walls, and furniture.

Assess the specific needs and priorities of each project to determine if bamboocrete is a suitable solution. Consult with architects and engineers experienced in sustainable construction.

# Conclusion

Bamboocrete, which combines bamboo reinforcement and oil palm kernel shell lightweight concrete, is a promising sustainable alternative to steel-reinforced concrete. Its advantages include:

1. Lower material costs
2. Reduced structure weight  
3. Renewable bamboo instead of steel
4. Utilization of waste PKS 
5. Good structural capacity
6. Flexibility to resist earthquake and wind loads

Bamboocrete panels are well-suited for low-cost housing, disaster-resistant structures, temporary buildings, and sustainable construction. With proper design and production quality control, bamboocrete can help meet the rising global demand for affordable and eco-friendly construction materials.
