José wiped the sweat from his brow as he surveyed the sloping land behind their home. The morning sun was already hot, but there was work to be done. Today was the day they would begin building their fish pond, a project José had been planning for months.
"Maria, Lucia!" he called. "It's time to start. Bring the stakes and string!"

His wife and daughter emerged from the house, carrying the materials. Lucia, at 10 years old, was eager to help and learn.
"First," José explained, "we need to find the right spot. We want it close to our water harvesting systems, but with some shade to keep the water cool."
They walked the land, finally settling on a area downhill from their swales and rainwater tanks, partially shaded by a cluster of teak trees.
Using an A-frame level José had constructed from bamboo, they carefully marked out the contours of the land. José showed Lucia how to use it, explaining the importance of working with the land's natural shape.
"See how the bubble settles in the middle when it's level? That's how we know we're following the contour," he said.

They spent the morning marking out an irregular shape for the pond, about 8 meters by 6 meters. José explained that the long, curving edge would provide more shoreline habitat for the fish.
As they began to dig, the family fell into a rhythm. José used a shovel to break up the earth, while Maria and Lucia used hoes to move it, building up the banks of the pond.
"Remember," José said, pausing to take a drink of water, "we want different depths. The shallow areas will be for plants, and the deeper areas for the fish to swim and stay cool."
Days passed as they dug deeper, shaping the pond. The soil was heavy clay - perfect for holding water. Still, José decided to line the pond with additional clay to be sure.
"In Timor-Leste, water is precious," he told Lucia. "We must make sure not to waste a drop."

As they worked, José shared stories of the land and their ancestors. He spoke of how their grandparents had used traditional knowledge to farm these hills, working in harmony with nature.
Finally, the pond was ready to be filled. They connected pipes from their rainwater tanks and swales, allowing the water to slowly trickle in.
"Now we wait," José said. "The pond needs time to settle and come to life."
Over the next weeks, they prepared the pond ecosystem. José added compost to the bottom for nutrients. They planted water spinach and watercress in the shallows, and lotus in the deeper areas.
Lucia helped her father add rocks and logs to create hiding spots for the future fish. "The fish will need homes too," José explained with a smile.
As the plants grew and the water cleared, life began to appear in the pond. One sunny afternoon, Lucia sat by the water's edge, fascinated by the activity.
"Papa, come look!" she called excitedly.

José crouched beside her, following her pointing finger. Dragonflies darted over the water's surface, their iridescent wings shimmering. Water striders skated gracefully across the pond.
"Look there," José said softly, indicating a spot near the lotus. A green tree frog clung to a stem, its eyes bulging as it watched for prey.
Lucia gasped as a bright flash of blue caught her eye. "What's that, Papa?"
"That's a kingfisher," José explained. "It's come to hunt for small fish and insects."

"Our pond is becoming part of the web of life," José said, his voice filled with wonder. "Just as our ancestors taught us, when we work with nature, she rewards us abundantly."
In the coming weeks, they would add tilapia and carp to the pond, completing their aquaculture system. But for now, José and Lucia sat in contented silence, watching the sun set over their new creation, listening to the evening chorus of frogs and crickets welcoming the night.
As the pond neared completion, José felt a deep sense of gratitude welling up inside him. The family had worked hard, and now they were on the cusp of bringing new life to their land. On the morning they were to add the fish, José woke before dawn.
He made his way to the pond in the soft pre-dawn light, carrying a small basket of offerings - fresh fruit, flowers, and a piece of honeycomb from their beehives. Kneeling at the water's edge, José closed his eyes and began to speak softly.
"Great Mother Vere-Lilin," he intoned, his voice barely above a whisper, "we honor you and seek your blessing on this pond. You who nurture all life, from the tiniest insect to the mightiest tree, we ask that you extend your grace to the fish we will raise here."
José placed the offerings at the pond's edge, then took a handful of water and let it trickle back into the pond.
"As this water flows, may your blessings flow into our lives and the lives of all creatures who will call this pond home. May it bring sustenance to our family and harmony to our land."
He remained there for a moment, head bowed in reverence. As the first rays of sunlight began to paint the sky, José opened his eyes and smiled. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the teak trees, and he felt a sense of peace settle over him.
Rising, José turned to see Maria and Lucia approaching, carrying the first of the fish in a large bucket.
"Are we ready, Papa?" Lucia asked excitedly.

José nodded, his eyes twinkling. "Yes, my dear. Vere-Lilin has blessed our pond. Now it's time to welcome its new inhabitants."
Together, the family began to carefully introduce the fish into their new home, each splash a promise of the abundance to come. As they worked, José silently thanked Vere-Lilin once more, feeling the deep connection between their efforts, the land, and the divine spirit that watched over them all.
