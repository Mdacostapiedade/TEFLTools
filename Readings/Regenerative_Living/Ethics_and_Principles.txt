# Handout: Permaculture Ethics and Principles

## Permaculture Ethics:
1. Earth Care: Sustaining and regenerating the natural environment
2. People Care: Providing for human needs in a sustainable and equitable way
3. Fair Share: Distributing surplus resources and managing consumption responsibly

## Permaculture Principles:
1. Observe and interact: Take time to engage with nature, learn from it, and design solutions that align with its patterns and rhythms.

2. Catch and store energy: Develop systems to collect and store resources (such as water, sun, and nutrients) when they are abundant for use in times of need.

3. Obtain a yield: Design for self-reliance by growing food, harvesting water, and generating energy to meet your needs sustainably.

4. Apply self-regulation and accept feedback: Adopt practices that limit overexploitation of resources and be open to feedback from the environment to guide decision-making.

5. Use and value renewable resources and services: Prioritize the use of renewable inputs and minimize the consumption of non-renewable resources.

6. Produce no waste: View waste as a resource and design closed-loop systems where outputs from one element become inputs for another.

7. Design from patterns to details: Observe the patterns in nature and use them as a guide for designing systems, then fill in the details as you go.

8. Integrate rather than segregate: Create diverse, symbiotic relationships between elements to foster resilience and stability.

9. Use small and slow solutions: Start with small-scale, manageable solutions and allow them to evolve over time, as they are more adaptable and easier to maintain.

10. Use and value diversity: Embrace diversity in all its forms (biodiversity, cultural diversity, economic diversity) to build resilience and adaptability.

11. Use edges and value the marginal: Take advantage of the unique opportunities and resources found at the edges and margins of systems, where two environments meet.

12. Creatively use and respond to change: View change as an inevitable and essential part of life; adapt and evolve with it, using it as an opportunity for innovation and growth.

## Case Study Scenarios:

Instructions: For each scenario, apply the permaculture ethics and principles to develop a sustainable solution. Consider the specific challenges and opportunities presented in each case, and think about how you can design a system that mimics natural patterns, closes loops, and creates beneficial relationships between elements. Be prepared to share your ideas with the group and discuss alternative approaches.

1. Backyard Vegetable Garden
   You have a small backyard and want to create a sustainable vegetable garden. How can you apply permaculture ethics and principles to design and maintain your garden?

2. Community Organic Waste Management
   Your community generates a significant amount of organic waste. Develop a plan to manage this waste using permaculture principles, considering factors such as composting, mulching, and reducing waste at the source.

3. Transitioning to Regenerative Agriculture
   A local farm wants to transition from conventional to regenerative agriculture. Advise the farmers on how they can apply permaculture ethics and principles to guide their transition and create a more sustainable and resilient farming system.
