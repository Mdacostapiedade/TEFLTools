Food Forests and Forest Gardens

A food forest is a diverse planting of edible plants that mimics the structure and ecosystem of a natural forest. It is a type of agroforestry, which combines trees, shrubs, herbs, and vegetables in a productive and sustainable system. Food forests are designed to be self-sustaining, with minimal maintenance required once established.

Forest gardens, on the other hand, are a specific type of food forest that is modeled after the structure and patterns found in natural woodlands or forests. They typically feature a canopy layer of tall fruit and nut trees, an understory of smaller trees and shrubs, and a groundcover layer of herbs, vegetables, and root crops.

Vocabulary:

1. Canopy layer: The uppermost layer of a food forest or forest garden, consisting of tall fruit and nut trees that provide shade and a protective cover.

2. Understory: The layer beneath the canopy, composed of smaller trees, shrubs, and woody plants that thrive in partial shade.

3. Groundcover: The lowest layer of the forest garden, consisting of herbaceous plants, vegetables, and root crops that grow in the shaded areas beneath the canopy and understory.

4. Guilds: A group of plants that are intentionally planted together because they support each other's growth and provide mutual benefits, such as nitrogen fixation, pest control, or soil conditioning.

5. Polyculture: A system of growing multiple crops together, in contrast to monoculture, which focuses on a single crop.

6. Succession: The natural process of change in an ecosystem, where one plant community is gradually replaced by another over time.

7. Perennial: A plant that lives for more than two years, often self-seeding or regrowing from its roots, allowing for continuous harvests without the need for annual replanting.

8. Agroforestry: The practice of integrating trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock in a single system, providing economic, environmental, and social benefits.

Food forests and forest gardens are designed to mimic the layered structure, diversity, and resilience of natural forest ecosystems, while providing a sustainable source of food, fuel, fiber, and other valuable products.
