Introduction to Phytochemistry

Phytochemistry is the study of chemicals derived from plants (phyto means "plant" in Greek). It is a highly specialized branch of biochemistry involved in the identification, extraction, and understanding of the biochemical properties and synthesis of all plant-based compounds.

Plants produce a wide array of chemically complex organic compounds as part of their metabolic processes. While some of these are primary metabolites essential for basic functions like growth and reproduction, others are secondary metabolites that serve more specialized ecological roles.

Primary Metabolites vs Secondary Metabolites
Primary metabolites include fundamental biomolecules like carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids that are found across all plant species. Secondary metabolites on the other hand, play more narrow roles like:

- Protection against herbivores, pathogens or environmental stresses
- Attracting pollinators and seed dispersers  
- Competing with other plants
- Supporting structural components

Secondary metabolites are often restricted to specific plant families, genera or species. These are the compounds that give many medicinal plants their therapeutic properties and activities. Some major categories of secondary metabolites include:

- Alkaloids
- Terpenoids 
- Phenolic compounds
- Glycosides

While primary metabolites are directly involved in processes like photosynthesis and respiration, secondary metabolites are the focus of phytochemical research and pharmacological screening for potential medicinal applications.

Biosynthesis of Phytochemicals
Plants are able to biosynthesize the diverse array of phytochemicals from relatively few basic precursor compounds like acetyl-CoA, shikimate, mevalonate and amino acids. Understanding these biosynthetic pathways is key to deriving therapeutic agents from botanical sources.

For example, the mevalonic acid pathway is how all terpenoids are synthesized, while the shikimic acid pathway leads to production of phenolic compounds. Intricate enzyme-catalyzed chemical transformations convert these basic precursors into the complex molecular structures.

Concepts like optical isomerism, functional groups, and electronegativity from organic chemistry can shed light on the mechanisms of action and therapeutic properties that phytochemicals may exhibit.

Vocabulary:

Phytochemistry - The study of chemicals derived from plants
Metabolite - Any compound involved in an organism's metabolic processes  
Primary metabolite - Compounds essential for basic life processes
Secondary metabolite - Specialized compounds that serve auxiliary roles
Alkaloid - Nitrogen-containing phytochemical 
Terpenoid - Phytochemical built up from isoprene units
