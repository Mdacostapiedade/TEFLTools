Project Plan: Adapting One Acre Fund's Model to Timor-Leste

Objective: To improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Timor-Leste by providing access to quality inputs, training, and support services, while promoting sustainable agricultural practices and climate resilience.

1. Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment:
   - Engage with local communities, farmers' groups, and government agencies to understand the unique challenges and opportunities facing smallholder farmers in Timor-Leste.
   - Assess the agro-ecological conditions, prevalent crops, farming practices, and market systems.

2. Develop a localized product and service offering:
   - Identify the most suitable crop varieties for Timor-Leste's climate and soil conditions, focusing on staple crops like maize, rice, and cassava, as well as high-value crops with strong market potential.
   - Source high-quality seeds, fertilizers, and other inputs from reliable suppliers, ensuring their suitability for local conditions.
   - Design a comprehensive training program covering land preparation, planting techniques, pest and disease management, composting, and agroforestry practices, tailored to the needs of Timorese farmers.

3. Establish partnerships and distribution channels:
   - Collaborate with local government agencies, NGOs, and community organizations to leverage existing networks and resources.
   - Set up a network of local field officers to provide training, support, and last-mile delivery of inputs to farmers.
   - Explore partnerships with microfinance institutions to facilitate access to credit for farmers to purchase inputs and invest in their farms.

4. Implement a tree-planting initiative:
   - Promote agroforestry practices by providing farmers with quality tree seedlings and training on tree planting and management.
   - Focus on tree species that provide multiple benefits, such as improving soil health, providing fodder for livestock, and generating additional income through fruit or timber production.
   - Set ambitious but achievable tree-planting targets, engaging communities and schools in tree-planting campaigns to build momentum and raise awareness.

5. Leverage technology for efficiency and scale:
   - Develop a mobile platform using USSD technology to enable farmers to access information, training materials, and support services using basic mobile phones.
   - Equip field officers with tablets to streamline data collection, monitoring, and evaluation processes.
   - Explore the use of digital payment systems to facilitate loan repayments and transactions between farmers and input suppliers.

6. Monitor, evaluate, and adapt:
   - Establish a robust monitoring and evaluation framework to track progress, measure impact, and identify areas for improvement.
   - Conduct regular surveys and focus group discussions with participating farmers to gather feedback and insights.
   - Use data-driven insights to continually refine and adapt the program to better meet the needs of smallholder farmers in Timor-Leste.

7. Build resilience and sustainability:
   - Integrate climate-smart agriculture practices into all training programs, promoting techniques such as conservation agriculture, water management, and integrated pest management.
   - Encourage crop diversification and intercropping to enhance food security and reduce vulnerability to climate shocks and market fluctuations.
   - Explore opportunities to link farmers to markets and value chains, helping them to increase their incomes and build long-term resilience.

By adapting One Acre Fund's proven model to the unique context of Timor-Leste, this project aims to empower smallholder farmers, improve food security, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. Through a combination of quality inputs, training, support services, and innovative partnerships, the project seeks to transform the lives of Timorese farmers and their communities.
