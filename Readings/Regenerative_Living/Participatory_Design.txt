Participatory Design in Community Development: A Timor-Leste Perspective

Introduction

A. Define participatory design and its role in community development

Participatory design is an approach to planning and problem-solving that actively involves all stakeholders in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable. In the context of community development, participatory design refers to the collaborative process of engaging local community members in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of development projects and initiatives.

This approach recognizes that local communities possess valuable knowledge, experiences, and insights that are crucial for creating effective and sustainable solutions to their challenges. By involving community members as active participants rather than passive recipients of development efforts, participatory design aims to create more relevant, acceptable, and sustainable outcomes.

The role of participatory design in community development is multifaceted:

1. Empowerment: It gives voice and agency to community members, allowing them to shape their own development path.

2. Contextual Understanding: It helps identify and address local needs, priorities, and constraints that may not be apparent to outside experts.

3. Capacity Building: Through involvement in the design process, community members develop skills and knowledge that can be applied to future challenges.

4. Sustainability: Solutions developed through participatory processes are more likely to be maintained and supported by the community in the long term.

5. Social Cohesion: The collaborative nature of participatory design can strengthen community bonds and promote collective action.

B. Brief history of community participation in Timor-Leste

Timor-Leste's history of community participation is deeply rooted in traditional governance structures and has evolved through periods of colonization, occupation, and independence.

Pre-colonial era:
- Traditional Timorese society had established systems of community decision-making, often centered around the Uma Lulik (sacred house) and led by local chiefs and elders.
- Communal land management and labor-sharing practices were common, reflecting a participatory approach to resource allocation and community development.

Portuguese colonial period (1515-1975):
- While Portuguese rule disrupted many traditional practices, some forms of community participation persisted, particularly in rural areas.
- The introduction of the suco (village) administrative system incorporated elements of traditional governance but within a colonial framework.

Indonesian occupation (1975-1999):
- Community participation was severely restricted under Indonesian rule, with development projects often imposed from the top down.
- However, clandestine resistance networks relied heavily on community participation and solidarity, laying the groundwork for future grassroots organizing.

Post-independence (1999-present):
- The transition to independence saw a renewed emphasis on community participation, influenced by international development practices and a desire to reconnect with traditional Timorese values.
- The establishment of the Community Empowerment Project (CEP) in 2000 marked a significant shift towards participatory approaches in national development strategies.
- Subsequent initiatives, such as the Integrated Community Development Program (PNDS), have further institutionalized participatory methods in local governance and development planning.

C. Importance of participatory approaches in building resilient communities

4. Gender equality: Actively promoting the equal participation of women and men in the design process.
5. Intergenerational dialogue: Encouraging participation from both elders and youth to bridge traditional knowledge with new perspectives.

In Timor-Leste:
- Special attention may be needed to ensure participation from different linguistic groups (e.g., Tetum, Mambae, Fataluku speakers).
- Traditional power structures in Timorese communities may need to be navigated carefully to ensure truly inclusive participation.

B. Local knowledge and expertise

This principle recognizes that community members possess valuable knowledge about their environment, needs, and potential solutions. It emphasizes the importance of integrating this local expertise with external technical knowledge.

Key aspects:
1. Valuing traditional knowledge: Recognizing and incorporating traditional practices, beliefs, and problem-solving approaches.
2. Experiential understanding: Acknowledging the deep understanding community members have of local challenges and contexts.
3. Skills and capacities: Identifying and leveraging existing skills and capacities within the community.
4. Knowledge exchange: Facilitating dialogue between local and external knowledge systems.

In Timor-Leste:
- Traditional ecological knowledge, such as indigenous farming practices or natural resource management techniques, can be particularly valuable.
- The role of Uma Lulik (sacred houses) and associated knowledge systems should be respected and integrated where appropriate.

C. Shared decision-making

This principle ensures that power in the design process is distributed among all participants, rather than being concentrated in the hands of external experts or local elites.

Key aspects:
1. Consensus building: Encouraging collective agreement on key decisions through inclusive dialogue.
2. Transparency: Ensuring all participants have access to relevant information to make informed decisions.
3. Equitable voice: Creating spaces where all participants feel empowered to express their views and influence decisions.
4. Conflict resolution: Establishing mechanisms to address disagreements constructively.

In Timor-Leste:
- Traditional consensus-building practices, such as nahe biti (unfolding the mat), can be incorporated into the decision-making process.
- Care must be taken to ensure that shared decision-making doesn't reinforce existing power imbalances within communities.

D. Iterative and flexible processes

This principle recognizes that community development is complex and dynamic, requiring processes that can adapt to changing circumstances and new insights.

Key aspects:
1. Continuous learning: Building in opportunities for reflection and learning throughout the design process.
2. Adaptability: Being willing to modify plans and approaches based on feedback and emerging challenges.

E. Design charrettes

Design charrettes are intensive, collaborative planning sessions where community members work together with facilitators to develop solutions to specific challenges.

Process:
1. Identify a specific challenge or project to focus on.
2. Gather a diverse group of community members and relevant experts.
3. Provide background information and any necessary materials (maps, data, etc.).
4. Facilitate intensive brainstorming and design sessions, often over several days.
5. Present and refine ideas through an iterative process.
6. Conclude with a presentation of final concepts or plans.

Benefits in Timor-Leste:
- Can be adapted to incorporate traditional decision-making processes, enhancing legitimacy of outcomes.
- Useful for tackling complex challenges, such as urban planning in rapidly growing areas like Dili.
- Builds capacity for collaborative problem-solving, a valuable skill in Timor-Leste's ongoing development process.

F. Brief demonstration or role-play of one technique

For this paper, let's briefly demonstrate how a seasonal calendar might be used in a Timorese context:

Facilitator: "Today, we're going to create a seasonal calendar for our community. This will help us understand how our activities, challenges, and opportunities change throughout the year. Let's start with the wet season - when does it usually begin?"

Participant 1: "The rains usually start in November, but sometimes they come late."

Facilitator: (Marking on a large paper divided into 12 months) "Okay, I'll mark that here. What are the main activities that happen when the rains start?"

Participant 2: "That's when we start planting maize and rice in the lowlands."

Participant 3: "It's also when we have to be careful about landslides in the hilly areas."

Facilitator: "Great, I'll note both of those. Now, let's think about the dry season..."

This process would continue, mapping out activities, challenges, and opportunities across the year. The resulting calendar could then be used to plan development initiatives that align with the community's seasonal rhythms and address specific challenges at appropriate times of the year.

These participatory design methods, when properly adapted to the Timorese context, can be powerful tools for engaging communities in the development process. They help ensure that development initiatives are grounded in local realities, responsive to community needs, and supported by the people they aim to benefit.
