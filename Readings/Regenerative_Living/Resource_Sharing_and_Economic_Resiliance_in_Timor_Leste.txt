C. Traditional bartering systems

Bartering, the direct exchange of goods and services without the use of money, remains an important practice in many Timorese communities.

Characteristics of Timorese bartering systems:
1. Seasonal exchanges: Often tied to agricultural cycles, with surplus produce exchanged for other goods.
2. Cross-ecological exchanges: Coastal communities may barter fish for inland products like vegetables or timber.
3. Service exchange: Skills or labor may be bartered for goods or other services.
4. Cultural significance: Certain items, like tais (traditional woven cloth), play important roles in ceremonial exchanges.
5. Flexibility: Allows for economic activity in cash-poor communities.

Example: In some mountain communities, coffee farmers might barter their produce for fish from coastal villages, maintaining important economic links between different ecological zones.

D. Role of extended family networks in resource sharing

Extended family networks play a crucial role in resource sharing and economic support in Timorese society.

Key aspects:
1. Shared labor: Family members often contribute labor to each other's agricultural or business activities.
2. Risk pooling: Extended families serve as informal insurance systems, providing support during hardships.
3. Child care: Shared child care responsibilities allow family members to engage in economic activities.
4. Knowledge transfer: Traditional skills and knowledge are often passed down through family networks.
