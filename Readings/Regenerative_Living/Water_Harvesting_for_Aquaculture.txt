Water Harvesting for Aquaculture

In Timor-Leste, water is a precious resource, and harvesting it is essential for farming and daily life. One way to use harvested water productively is in aquaculture - the raising of fish, prawns, and other aquatic creatures for food.

To create a successful aquaculture system, you need a reliable water source. While springs, streams, and wells can provide water, harvesting rainwater through swales, ponds, tanks, and cisterns can also play a crucial role.

Swales are long, shallow trenches dug along the contours of a slope. They catch and hold rainwater, allowing it to soak into the ground and recharge groundwater. By directing some of this water into fish ponds, swales can provide a steady water supply, especially important in the dry season.

Ponds and tanks can also be used to store water for fish farming. A larger pond above the fish pond can serve as a reservoir, holding water that can be gradually released into the fish pond as needed. Tanks and cisterns can also collect rainwater from rooftops, providing another source of clean water for the fish.

Once you have a reliable water source, you can design your fish pond. The pond should be located in an area with some shade to keep the water cool, but also receive some sunlight to support the growth of aquatic plants. The size, depth, and shape of the pond are also important, with a variety of depths creating different habitats for the fish.

Before adding fish, the pond should be prepared with nutrients, hiding spots, and vegetation. Planting around the edges of the pond can also provide shade, food, and erosion control. 

When it's time to add the fish, consider raising different types together. In Timor-Leste, tilapia, carp, catfish, and Ikan Mujair are popular choices. Each species feeds at a different level in the pond, creating a balanced ecosystem.

With careful water management and good pond design, an aquaculture system can provide a sustainable source of protein and income, even in challenging environments. By integrating water harvesting techniques like swales, ponds, tanks, and cisterns, fish farmers can ensure a steady water supply and a thriving aquatic habitat. 

Building Swales:
1. Identify the contour lines of your land using an A-frame level or other surveying tool. Contour lines connect points of equal elevation.
2. Mark out the contour lines with stakes and string.
3. Dig a trench along the contour line. The trench should be about 50cm deep and 30-50cm wide, with gently sloping sides.
4. Pile the excavated soil on the downhill side of the trench to create a berm.
5. Plant the berm with trees, shrubs, or grasses to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion.
6. Direct overflow water from the swale to your fish pond using pipes or channels.

Building a Water Storage Pond:
1. Choose a location for your pond that is uphill from your fish pond. The site should have stable soils and receive runoff from a large catchment area.
2. Mark out the shape of your pond with stakes and string. An irregular shape with a long edge on the downhill side is best.
3. Excavate the pond to a depth of 2-3 meters. The sides should have a gentle slope for stability.
4. If the soil is porous, line the pond with clay, plastic, or cement to prevent leakage.
5. Create an overflow spillway on the downhill side of the pond to safely direct excess water.
6. Plant vegetation around the pond to provide shade, prevent erosion, and filter inflow water.
7. Install piping or a channel to direct water from the storage pond to your fish pond as needed.

Installing a Rainwater Tank or Cistern:
1. Choose a location for your tank or cistern that is close to your fish pond and the buildings or surfaces that will collect rainwater.
2. Create a stable, level base for your tank using concrete or compressed earth.
3. Assemble your tank following the manufacturer's instructions, or build your cistern with bricks, concrete, or ferrocement.
4. Install gutters and downspouts on your roof to channel rainwater into the tank. Make sure to include a 'first flush' system to divert the first, dirty rainwater away from the tank.
5. Include an overflow pipe to direct excess water away from the tank base.
6. Install a tap or pump to draw water from the tank and direct it to your fish pond as needed.

Integrating with Your Fish Pond:
1. Locate your fish pond downhill from your water harvesting structures, so gravity can move the water to where it's needed.
2. Create channels, swales, or pipes to direct water from your swales, storage pond, and rainwater tanks to your fish pond.
3. Include a filtration system, such as a gravel bed or settling pond, to remove sediment and debris from the inflow water.
4. Monitor water levels in your fish pond daily, and adjust your water flows as needed to maintain optimal levels.
5. Plant vegetation around your fish pond to provide shade, food for the fish, and to stabilize the pond banks.
6. Regularly inspect and maintain your water harvesting structures and connecting channels to ensure they are functioning properly.

Building a Fish Pond:
Choosing a Location:
1. Select a site that is close to a reliable water source, such as a spring, stream, well, or water harvesting structure.
2. Ensure the site receives some shade to keep the water cool, but also gets some sunlight to support aquatic plant growth.
3. Choose an area with stable, clay-rich soils to minimize water loss through seepage.
4. Avoid areas prone to flooding or erosion.

Designing the Pond:
1. Decide on the size of your pond based on your land availability and desired fish production. A pond of 5m x 5m to 10m x 10m is a good starting size.
2. Design your pond with a variety of depths to create different habitats for your fish. Include shallow areas (30-50cm deep) for water plants, and deeper areas (1-2m deep) for fish to swim and cool off.
3. Create an irregular shape with a long edge to maximize the shoreline habitat for your fish.
4. Include a drainage pipe or channel at the lowest point of the pond for easy draining and cleaning.

Constructing the Pond:
1. Mark out the shape of your pond using stakes and string.
2. Excavate the pond to the desired depth, creating the different depth zones as planned. Use the excavated soil to build up the pond banks.
3. Compact the pond bottom and sides to minimize water loss. If the soil is porous, consider lining the pond with clay, plastic, or cement.
4. Install any drainage pipes or channels, making sure they are securely buried and protected from erosion.
5. Allow the pond to fill with water from your water source or harvesting structures. Monitor the water level and check for any leaks.

Preparing the Pond:
1. Add a layer of organic matter, such as animal manure or compost, to the pond bottom to provide nutrients for the aquatic ecosystem.
2. Plant aquatic vegetation in the shallow areas of the pond. Use a variety of species that provide food, shelter, and water filtration, such as water spinach, lotus, and water lilies.
3. Create hiding spots and breeding areas for your fish by adding rocks, logs, or other structures to the pond.
4. Allow the pond ecosystem to establish for a few weeks before adding fish. This allows the water chemistry to stabilize and the aquatic plants to grow.

Stocking the Pond:
1. Choose fish species that are well-suited to your local climate and pond conditions. In Timor-Leste, tilapia, carp, catfish, and Ikan Mujair are good options.
2. Stock your pond with a mix of species that occupy different ecological niches. This promotes a balanced ecosystem and efficient use of resources.
3. Introduce young fish to the pond, as they will have a better chance of surviving and adapting to the new environment.
4. Monitor the fish closely for the first few weeks, watching for signs of stress or disease. Adjust feeding and water management as needed.

Maintaining the Pond:
1. Feed your fish a balanced diet of commercial fish feed, supplemented with fresh plant material and agricultural byproducts.
2. Monitor water quality regularly, checking parameters such as temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen. Adjust water flows or aeration as needed.
3. Remove any uneaten feed or debris from the pond to prevent water pollution.
4. Harvest fish regularly to maintain a balanced population and to provide a steady supply of food and income.
5. Drain and clean the pond annually to remove accumulated sediment and to maintain a healthy environment for your fish.
