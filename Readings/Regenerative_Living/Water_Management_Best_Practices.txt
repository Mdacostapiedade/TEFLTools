Urban Water Supply and Sanitation in Southeast Asia: Key Recommendations

1. Abolish Connection Fees and Recover Costs Through Tariffs

High connection fees are a major barrier to improving service coverage, especially for the urban poor. Vietnam has shown a successful model by abolishing connection fees and recovering costs through slightly higher tariffs for all users. This approach spreads the cost of new connections across the entire customer base, making access more equitable. To implement this, utilities need to conduct careful financial modeling to determine the appropriate tariff increase needed to cover connection costs. They should also engage in public education campaigns to explain the benefits of this approach to existing customers. Governments may need to revise regulations to allow for this cost recovery method.

2. Manage Distribution Systems at the Lowest Practicable Level

Reducing non-revenue water (NRW) is crucial for improving utility efficiency and financial sustainability. Manila Water and Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority have demonstrated success by managing distribution at the lowest practicable level, often in zones of around 500 connections. This approach, sometimes called the "caretaker approach," involves assigning staff responsibility for small areas where they can closely monitor consumption, quickly identify leaks, and build relationships with customers. Implementation requires reorganizing utility staff structures, providing training on zonal management techniques, and investing in district metering and pressure management equipment. Regular performance reviews and staff incentives tied to NRW reduction targets in their zones can drive continuous improvement.

3. Raise Tariffs to Improve Financial Sustainability

Low tariffs limit utilities' ability to invest in infrastructure and improve service quality. However, tariff increases are often politically sensitive. Successful approaches involve gradual increases tied to service improvements, extensive public consultation, and maintaining lifeline tariffs for low-income households. Utilities should first engage customers to gain their support for tariff increases by clearly communicating the link between higher tariffs and better services. They should also improve efficiency alongside tariff increases to demonstrate good faith. Regulators or government agencies responsible for approving tariffs need to establish clear, transparent processes for tariff reviews based on financial sustainability principles.

4. Integrate Water Supply and Sanitation Under One Agency

Following Singapore's example, putting responsibility for the entire water cycle from source to disposal/reuse under one agency can greatly improve coordination and efficiency. This integration allows for better planning, shared resources, and the ability to manage water as a circular system rather than linear process. To achieve this, governments may need to reorganize existing agencies, revise legal frameworks, and carefully manage the transition to avoid disrupting ongoing operations. Staff capacity building will likely be needed to broaden expertise across water and sanitation disciplines.

5. Corporatize Utilities to Improve Autonomy and Efficiency

Transforming utilities from government departments to corporatized entities can increase their operational and financial autonomy, leading to improved efficiency and service delivery. This process involves establishing the utility as a separate legal entity, often with the government as the sole or majority shareholder. Key steps include developing new governance structures (e.g., board of directors), implementing commercial accounting practices, and shifting to market-based employment policies. The transition requires careful change management, including extensive staff training and communication. Lao PDR's experience shows this is a gradual process that may take several years to fully implement.

6. Improve Data Collection, Analysis, and Reporting

Better data is crucial for informed decision-making and accountability. Utilities should focus on collecting a core set of key performance indicators and regularly benchmarking against other utilities. Implementing modern IT systems for customer management, billing, and asset management can greatly improve data quality and accessibility. Utilities should also develop user-friendly websites that transparently share performance data with the public. Regulators or national agencies can play a role by standardizing reporting requirements and facilitating data sharing across the sector.

7. Prioritize Sanitation and Develop Clear Policies and Plans

Many Southeast Asian cities lag in sanitation development. Governments need to elevate sanitation as a policy priority, developing clear national policies and city-level sanitation master plans. These should include strategies for both networked sewerage and on-site sanitation systems where appropriate. Dedicated funding mechanisms for sanitation, potentially including sanitation surcharges on water bills or national government transfers, are crucial. Public awareness campaigns on the importance of sanitation are also key to building support for investment and behavior change.

8. Consider Decentralized and Low-Cost Sanitation Solutions

Given the high cost and long timelines for implementing centralized sewerage systems, cities should consider decentralized approaches, especially in the short to medium term. These might include improved septic tank management, small-scale sewage treatment plants, or innovative solutions like constructed wetlands. Successful implementation requires clear guidelines and standards for these systems, training for local service providers, and appropriate financing mechanisms. Community engagement is crucial, as seen in the success of Community-Led Total Sanitation approaches in rural areas, which may be adaptable to urban contexts.
