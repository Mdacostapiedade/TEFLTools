Water resource management is a critical challenge in Asia due to increasing population, economic growth, and environmental pressures. The region faces widespread water scarcity, quality deterioration, and ecosystem destruction. By 2025, an estimated 2.4 billion people in Asia will suffer from water stress.
Historically, water management in Asia has focused on increasing supply rather than conservation, with fragmented governance and weak coordination between agencies. A paradigm shift is needed towards sustainable, integrated management emphasizing cross-sectoral integration, decentralization, and demand-driven approaches.
Two key issues are the supply of safe drinking water and promotion of integrated water resources management (IWRM). While Asia has 32% of the world's freshwater resources, per capita availability is only 4,000 m3/year, less than half the world average. Water availability varies greatly across the region, with South Asia facing the most severe shortages.
Water demand is increasing rapidly, especially for agriculture, industry and domestic use. This is causing conflicts between users and environmental degradation from overexploitation. Water pollution is also a serious problem, with Asian rivers having much higher levels of contaminants than global averages.
To address these challenges, many Asian countries are adopting IWRM approaches. This often involves institutional reforms to better integrate fragmented water agencies. Two common models are:

Creating a unified "Ministry of Water Resources" to oversee policy and allocation (e.g. India, Bangladesh, China)
Establishing a Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment to manage water quantity and quality holistically (e.g. Thailand, Vietnam)

Countries are also setting up river basin organizations (RBOs) to manage water resources at the watershed level with stakeholder participation. Indonesia, Thailand and others have established RBOs, though implementation challenges remain around conflicts between national and local laws, capacity, data availability, and stakeholder engagement.
Improving water supply and sanitation access is another priority. About two-thirds of the 1.1 billion people globally without safe water access live in Asia. Various models are being tried:
Public-private partnerships (PPPs) for urban water supply have had mixed results. Manila's experience showed initial benefits but later problems with tariff increases and financial sustainability. More participatory PPP models involving communities have shown promise.
NGOs can play an effective intermediary role between poor communities and public utilities, as seen in Dhaka where an NGO helped slum dwellers gain water access.
Rainwater harvesting is gaining attention as a low-cost, community-managed option, especially in rural areas. Successful programs in Thailand, India and China have improved water access.
Key recommendations to improve water management in Asia include:

Provide better knowledge and information for decision-making
Institutionalize stakeholder participation in river basin management
Promote appropriate private sector participation based on past lessons
Apply simple technologies that enhance community participation
Establish participatory assessment and monitoring systems

International organizations, national governments, local authorities, NGOs, communities and the private sector all have important roles to play. Improving coordination and building synergies between stakeholders at all levels is crucial for sustainable water management in Asia.
