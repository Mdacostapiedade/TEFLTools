Synopsis:

Timor-Leste, a small island nation in Southeast Asia, faces significant climate change challenges. Its tropical climate, influenced by monsoons and El Niño/La Niña cycles, is projected to see rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns. These changes threaten natural resources, including water availability and coastal zones vulnerable to sea-level rise.
The country's biodiversity is at risk from habitat shifts and potential species loss. Economic sectors, particularly agriculture and fisheries, are highly vulnerable to climate impacts. Changes in crop yields and fish stocks could jeopardize food security. Communities face increased risks from climate-related disasters, with the poor and rural populations most vulnerable. Human health is threatened by heat stress and the potential spread of vector-borne diseases.
Timor-Leste has developed national adaptation policies and strategies to address these challenges. International organizations like the Asian Development Bank and World Bank Group are supporting climate resilience efforts. Key priorities include strengthening climate-resilient agriculture, improving water management, protecting coastal areas, enhancing disaster preparedness, and building adaptive capacity.

Overview of World Bank Climate Risk Report for Timor Leste report topics:

1. COUNTRY OVERVIEW

Timor-Leste is a small country located in Southeast Asia, comprising the eastern half of Timor Island and the small enclave of Oecussi within West Timor. With a population of approximately 1.3 million as of 2020 and a land area of 14,874 km², Timor-Leste is characterized by its mountainous terrain, with central mountains rising to 3,000 meters. This topography contributes significantly to soil erosion during heavy rainfall events, as nearly half of the country has slopes greater than 40%.

The nation faces considerable challenges related to natural hazards, being at high risk of cyclones, earthquakes, tsunamis, and heavy rainfall. These risks are exacerbated by limited and inadequate infrastructure and social welfare systems. Despite these challenges, Timor-Leste has undergone significant development in recent decades, largely due to political stability and oil revenues. However, the country remains one of the world's most oil-dependent nations, with production beginning in 2004 and originally predicted to finish in 2021, though recent explorations suggest production may extend until 2024/2025.

Economically, Timor-Leste struggles with high poverty rates, with approximately 42% of its population living below the national poverty line as of 2014. The country's economy is primarily agrarian, with about 66% of the population reliant on the agricultural sector. This economic structure, combined with the country's geographical features and climate vulnerabilities, makes Timor-Leste highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, particularly in sectors such as agriculture, water resources, forestry, and public health.

2. CLIMATOLOGY - Climate Baseline

Timor-Leste's climate is characterized as tropical, heavily influenced by the West Pacific Monsoon and its mountainous topography. The country experiences two distinct seasons: a wet season from December to May and a dry season from June to November. The southern parts of the country typically experience a longer wet season, lasting seven to nine months. Rainfall patterns vary across the country, with northern areas generally receiving less rainfall than the south.

A key feature of Timor-Leste's climate is the significant impact of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO can cause substantial variability in the inter-annual quantity of rainfall, fluctuating by up to 50%, and affect the timing of peak annual rainfall. This variability plays a crucial role in the country's agricultural productivity and water resource management.

Temperature patterns in Timor-Leste show relatively little seasonal variation, which is typical of tropical climates. The average monthly temperature ranges from a minimum of 24.1°C in July to a maximum of 25.4°C in November, a difference of only 1.3°C. The coldest months are June, July, and August. Precipitation, on the other hand, shows more significant seasonal variation, with the driest months (August and September) receiving between 12-18 mm of rainfall, while the wettest months (December to March) receive between 222-252 mm.

3. CLIMATOLOGY - Key Trends

Analyzing historical temperature changes in Timor-Leste has been challenging due to limited meteorological data availability. However, based on warming ocean trends recorded around the country, the Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science Adaptation Planning (PACCSAP) estimates that temperatures in Timor-Leste have likely increased in line with regional and global trends. Some studies suggest a rise in temperature of 0.16°C per decade since 1950, though accurate trends are difficult to establish given data limitations.

Precipitation trends in Timor-Leste show significant interannual variability associated with ENSO, which drives considerable variation in rainfall patterns. However, when looking at long-term trends, annual rainfall has shown little climate change-driven change since 1952. Some estimates suggest a negligible 6.4mm increase in annual rainfall from 1901-2009. It's important to note that there is insufficient data available to observe trends in daily rainfall, which could be more indicative of changing precipitation patterns.

The Berkeley Earth dataset, which provides historical temperature change estimates for 1° × 1° grid cells, estimates warming around the capital Dili between 1851 and 2017 (average) has been 0.8°C. However, it's crucial to interpret these results with caution, as estimates of warming over grid cells containing larger amounts of ocean cover are generally less reliable, though they tend to show less warming. The data suggests that warming appears to have accelerated since approximately 1980, aligning with global observations of accelerated climate change in recent decades.

4. CLIMATOLOGY - Climate Futures

Climate projections for Timor-Leste indicate a trend of increasing temperatures and potential changes in precipitation patterns. By the 2090s, under the RCP8.5 emissions pathway (high emissions scenario), annual mean surface air temperatures are projected to increase by approximately 2.9°C. Even under the RCP2.6 emissions pathway (low emissions scenario), an increase of 0.9°C is expected. These projections suggest that Timor-Leste will face significant warming regardless of global emission trajectories, though the magnitude of warming can be mitigated by global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Regarding precipitation, there is great uncertainty around projected changes. However, there is high confidence in an increase in extreme rainfall events. This means that while overall annual rainfall amounts may not change dramatically, the distribution and intensity of rainfall events are likely to shift. Timor-Leste may experience more frequent and intense heavy rainfall events, potentially interspersed with longer dry periods.

It's important to note that climate projections for small island nations like Timor-Leste come with inherent challenges. Most global climate models operate at large spatial scales and are not well-equipped to simulate the future climate of small islands accurately. The changes projected often relate more to expected changes over nearby ocean areas than the island itself. This highlights a significant area for future research and development, particularly in downscaling global climate models to provide more accurate local projections for island nations.

5. CLIMATE RELATED NATURAL HAZARDS

Timor-Leste faces high disaster risk levels, ranking 66th out of 191 countries in the 2019 Inform Risk Index. This ranking is largely due to the country's lack of coping capacity and the levels of social vulnerability in its population, both of which are scored lower than most countries in the region. The country is exposed to various climate-related natural hazards, including tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, and landslides.

Among these hazards, tropical cyclones represent the climate-related natural hazard that Timor-Leste is most exposed to, with the country ranking 43rd at-risk globally. However, it's worth noting that due to Timor-Leste's proximity to the equator, it encounters relatively low intensity and infrequent cyclones compared to other regions. Between 1969 and 2011, the country experienced seven tropical cyclones. Climate projections suggest a potential decrease in the frequency of tropical cyclones by 2100, although they may increase in intensity (e.g., wind speeds).

Flooding is another significant climate-related disaster that Timor-Leste is exposed to, accounting for 70% of its hazards. The country is vulnerable to river, coastal, and flash (surface) flooding. However, available data on flood risks is often lacking, and the risk to vulnerable populations may be understated. Climate change is expected to exacerbate flood risks through increased intensity of heavy short-term precipitation events and sea-level rise, which will increase the impact of storm surges and coastal flooding.

6. CLIMATE RELATED NATURAL HAZARDS - Heatwaves

Timor-Leste is projected to experience a significant increase in heatwave frequency and intensity due to climate change. Under the highest emissions pathway (RCP8.5), the annual probability of heatwaves is expected to rise steeply throughout the century. This increase primarily reflects the impact of constantly rising temperatures, which will generate historically unprecedented heat conditions on a regular basis.

A more tangible measure of future heat risks is the count of annual days in which conditions surpass a Heat Index of 35°C. Heat Index measures the combined impact of temperature and humidity, providing a more accurate representation of thermal comfort for the human body. Projections show that even under lower emissions pathways (e.g., RCP4.5), the count of days above this threshold could increase by over 100 annually by the end of the century.

The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) categorizes Timor-Leste's extreme heat hazard as 'medium', indicating there is greater than a 25% chance that the country will experience at least one period of prolonged exposure to extreme heat, resulting in heat stress, within the next five years. This increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves pose significant risks to human health, agricultural productivity, and overall socio-economic development in Timor-Leste.

7. CLIMATE RELATED NATURAL HAZARDS - Drought

Timor-Leste is vulnerable to two primary types of drought: meteorological (usually associated with a precipitation deficit) and hydrological (usually associated with a deficit in surface and subsurface water flow). While there are few documented drought events from before Timor-Leste's independence, anecdotal evidence suggests it is a frequent occurrence in the country.

Climate projections indicate that the likelihood of severe drought (as defined by a standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI) of less than −2) under the RCP8.5 pathway is projected to approximately double from 5% to 12% annual probability from the 2040s to the 2090s. However, it's important to note that there is significant uncertainty associated with these projections, and some models suggest much larger increases in future drought probability.

The potential increase in drought frequency and intensity is partly linked to the expected increase in El Niño events, which are associated with accentuated drought conditions and are predicted to become more frequent and intense due to global warming. However, projections from the Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation Planning Program (PACCSAP) show a lesser degree of change, suggesting that drought frequency might remain roughly similar to that found in the current climate. This discrepancy highlights the uncertainty in drought projections and the need for continued research and monitoring.

8. CLIMATE RELATED NATURAL HAZARDS - Flood and Landslide

Timor-Leste is exposed to various types of flooding, including river, coastal, and flash (surface) flooding. However, available data on flood risks is often lacking, and the risk to vulnerable populations may be understated. According to the World Resources Institute's AQUEDUCT Global Flood Analyzer, assuming protection for up to a 1 in 25-year event, the population annually affected by flooding in Timor-Leste was estimated at 259 people as of 2010, with expected annual urban damage estimated at $1.4 million.

Climate change is expected to exacerbate flood risks in Timor-Leste. Projections suggest an increase in the intensity of heavy short-term precipitation events, which could lead to more frequent and severe flooding. By 2030, under the RCP8.5 emissions pathway, the annually affected population is expected to increase by 111 people, and urban damage by $3.9 million. Recent events, such as the severe flooding in March 2020 and April 2021, highlight the country's vulnerability to these hazards.

Landslides are another significant risk, strongly linked to incidents of intense rainfall. The GFDRR's ThinkHazard portal classifies landslide risk in Timor-Leste as high. The country's shallow, rocky, and easily eroded soils, combined with upland farming practices and clearing of vegetation, contribute to this risk. Climate change is likely to increase the frequency and severity of landslides due to the projected increase in heavy rainfall events interspersed with dry periods, putting Timor-Leste's soils at greater risk of erosion.

9. CLIMATE RELATED NATURAL HAZARDS - Cyclone and Storm Surge

While Timor-Leste's proximity to the equator means it encounters relatively few and low-intensity cyclones, climate change is expected to interact with cyclone hazards in complex ways. Known risks include the action of sea-level rise to enhance the damage caused by cyclone-induced storm surges, and the possibility of increased windspeed and precipitation intensity during these events.

Global modeling of climate change impacts on cyclone intensity and frequency points to a general trend of reduced cyclone frequency but increased intensity and frequency of the most extreme events. For Timor-Leste specifically, the Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation Planning (PACCSAP) program forecasts a decrease in the frequency of tropical cyclones by 2100, although they may increase in intensity (e.g., wind speeds).

It's important to note that further research is required to better understand potential changes in cyclone seasonality and routes, and the potential for cyclone hazards to be experienced in unprecedented locations. The interaction between cyclones, storm surges, and sea-level rise is of particular concern for Timor-Leste's coastal communities and infrastructure.
10. CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS - Natural Resources

Water:
Timor-Leste's water resources are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Coastal areas in the country are particularly dependent on groundwater, with more than 60% of Dili's total annual water supply for agriculture, industrial, and domestic purposes coming from groundwater sources. The country's water resources face several challenges, including steep topography of catchment areas, variable sediment runoff following flash-flood events, and the wet-dry tropical monsoon climate.

Climate change is projected to have a negative impact on water management in Timor-Leste. Projected increases in intensity and variability of rainfall, coupled with sea-level rise, are likely to put pressure on ground- and surface-water resources through increased risks of flooding and droughts. Parts of northern Timor-Leste often experience water shortages in the dry season, a situation that may be exacerbated by climate change.

Access to clean water has been cited as a problem in some areas of the country, with changes in climate combined with large-scale deforestation contributing to loss and drying up of water sources. These impacts highlight the need for comprehensive water resource management strategies that take into account both climate change projections and land use changes.

The Coastal Zone:
As an island nation, Timor-Leste is particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise. Global mean sea-level rise was estimated in the range of 0.44-0.74 meters by the end of the 21st century by the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, but some more recent studies have suggested the potential for even more significant rises.

For Timor-Leste specifically, mean sea levels are projected to rise throughout the 21st century. By 2030, models project rises of around 80-180 mm under all RCP emission pathways. By 2090, under RCP8.5, sea-level rise is projected in the range of 430-880 mm. When combined with other changes, this sea-level rise will increase the impact of storm surges and coastal flooding.

The capital, Dili, is particularly vulnerable to coastal flooding, being situated only a few meters above sea level. Under the RCP8.5 emissions pathway, by 2070-2100, up to 7,200 people in Timor-Leste are potentially exposed to flooding from sea-level rise. However, with investment in effective adaptation, including balancing of trade-offs between hard infrastructural approaches and nature-based approaches, this number may be significantly reduced.

Biodiversity:
Timor-Leste harbors unique and abundant biodiversity, which is under threat from climate change. A key impact of climate change on wildlife is to shift the geographical range in which climate conditions are suited to species' survival. In general, shifts are expected to be either upslope to higher altitudes or away from the equator.

On islands like Timor-Leste, the pressure to range shift represents a significant threat to the survival of many species as suitable alternative habitats may not be either available or accessible. For some species, thresholds may be present where lower intensity climate changes can be tolerated, but more intense changes beyond a certain level result in loss or even extinction.

For example, mangroves in Timor-Leste are believed to have some tolerance to small rises in sea-level (3-18 cm) but are significantly at risk from greater rises. While research into the vulnerability of species in Timor-Leste is generally lacking, work on other islands in the region suggests that tree and lizard species could be at risk from range shifts. This highlights the need for more focused research on Timor-Leste's biodiversity and the development of conservation strategies that take into account potential climate change impacts.

11. CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS - Economic Sectors

Agriculture:
The agricultural sector in Timor-Leste is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The country does not produce enough food to feed its population, a result of poor soils, poor yielding local varieties, high variability in rainfall, steep slopes, and high weed burdens. With approximately 66% of families relying on some form of farming activity for their livelihoods, the impacts of climate change on agriculture could have far-reaching socio-economic consequences.

Climate change is set to alter rainfall patterns, with Timor-Leste's food production likely to be one of the most affected by changes in rainfall in Southeast Asia. Without management changes, increased temperatures in tropical regions like Timor-Leste are expected to lead to decreased yields. Analysis indicates that maize yields (the country's most abundant crop) may be only slightly affected, whereas peanut yields could significantly decrease. Furthermore, increased temperatures are likely to affect coffee yields, an important cash crop for the country.

The steep topography and climate varying with altitude in Timor-Leste mean that climate changes are likely to drive range shifts in the suitable growing area for different crops. In general, this will mean movement in an upslope direction of key crops such as maize. These shifts, combined with potential yield reductions, underscore the need for adaptive agricultural practices and crop diversification strategies to ensure food security in the face of climate change.

Fisheries:
While the fisheries sector in Timor-Leste is currently small and less developed than in many neighboring nations, it has potential to develop into an important source of income and bolster food security. However, climate change poses significant threats to this potential development.

Limited studies into the future climate impact on local fisheries have suggested that the outlook for near-coast fisheries is negative, with potential yield declines of 5%-10% by 2050. To an extent, these losses may be mitigated by better management techniques and adaptations. Economic modeling on the impact of adaptation scenarios on Timor-Leste fisheries estimates that total fish production could be increased marginally by 2035 and 2050, but that by 2050, fish supplies from ocean and coastal ecosystems will see a net decrease as a result of climate change.

This projected decline in fish supplies has significant food security implications for Timor-Leste, given that 94% of its domestic fish consumption comes from ocean and coastal ecosystems, as opposed to its freshwater ecosystems. The development of sustainable fisheries management practices and the exploration of aquaculture options may be crucial for maintaining and potentially growing this sector in the face of climate change impacts.

12. CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS - Communities

Poverty, Inequality and Vulnerability to Climate-Related Disaster:
Timor-Leste is highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters, which have significant impacts on communities, particularly those already facing poverty and inequality. During the period of 2001-2011, 20,000 people were affected and 10,000 houses were damaged by natural hazards, with climate-related disasters being the most impactful.

The country is especially vulnerable to high variability of rainfall, accentuated by El Niño and La Niña events. This variability can contribute to landslides, with 234 houses damaged and 222 people affected by landslides between 2003 and 2011. Flooding is the climate-related disaster Timor-Leste is most exposed to, accounting for 70% of its hazards, with storms and drought each accounting for 14%.

While Timor-Leste has made considerable progress in development in the last two decades, it still suffers from high levels of poverty, which climate change threatens to exacerbate. In particular, climate change threatens food security, to which the rural poor are most vulnerable. The international development community is well-established in Timor-Leste in terms of supporting the country with climate change adaptation. However, some scholars argue that donor-led adaptation programs focus too much on the biophysical components of vulnerability and not enough on the systemic socio-economic and political factors that underpin Timor-Leste's vulnerability to climate change.

Human Health:
Climate change is expected to have significant impacts on human health in Timor-Leste. The World Health Organization projects an increase in people at risk of malaria and dengue fever under both low (RCP2.6) and high (RCP8.5) emissions scenarios. In January 2014, the capital Dili experienced an extreme outbreak of dengue fever, with 197 reported cases and two fatalities in the first week of the outbreak.

Rising temperatures pose a direct threat to human health, particularly through increased heat-related illnesses and deaths. Work by Honda et al. (2014) estimates that without adaptation, annual heat-related deaths in the Southeast Asia region will increase 295% by 2030 and 691% by 2050. Under the RCP8.5 emissions pathway, heat-related deaths for those aged 65 and over in Timor-Leste are projected to increase considerably by 2080, from a baseline of zero per 100,000 in 1961-1990 to 39 per 100,000.

Climate change is also projected to exacerbate the significant problem of undernutrition in Timor-Leste. The World Food Programme estimates that without adaptation, the risk of hunger and child malnutrition on a global scale could increase by 20% by 2050. These health impacts highlight the urgent need for adaptation measures in the health sector, including improved disease surveillance, heat action plans, and nutrition programs.

13. POLICIES AND PROGRAMS - National Adaptation Policies and Strategies

Timor-Leste has developed several national policies and strategies to address climate change and its impacts. These include:

1. Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to Paris Climate Agreement: Timor-Leste submitted its NDC in November 2016. This document outlines the country's commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change impacts.

2. National Disaster Risk Management Plan: Enacted in 2008, this plan provides a framework for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery, including for climate-related disasters.

3. National Communications to the UNFCCC: Timor-Leste has submitted two National Communications, with the latest submitted in November 2020. These communications provide detailed information on the country's climate change situation, vulnerabilities, and adaptation efforts.

4. National Adaptation Programme of Action on Climate Change: Submitted in December 2010, this document identifies priority areas for climate change adaptation in Timor-Leste.

5. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan: Enacted in 2015, this plan addresses the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in Timor-Leste, including considerations of climate change impacts.

These policies and strategies demonstrate Timor-Leste's commitment to addressing climate change challenges. However, implementation and capacity building remain ongoing challenges for the country.

14. POLICIES AND PROGRAMS - Climate Change Priorities of ADB and the WBG

Asian Development Bank (ADB) - Country Partnership Strategy:
The ADB has agreed to a Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) with the Government of Timor-Leste covering the period 2016-2020. Climate change issues feature under the 'environmental sustainability' driver of change in this strategy. Key aspects include:

1. Supporting Timor-Leste to achieve environmental sustainability by strengthening legal and regulatory frameworks for environmental protection.
2. Building government capacity for implementation of environmental policies.
3. Ensuring long-term environmental sustainability by using the latest technologies to climate-proof new infrastructure and make services resilient to potential impacts of natural hazards.
4. Helping Timor-Leste access additional resources for environmental management and climate change mitigation from global financing mechanisms.

World Bank Group (WBG) - Country Partnership Framework:
The WBG and Timor-Leste agreed to a Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY2020-FY2024. Climate change and the environment are key focuses in this CPF. The framework recognizes that Timor-Leste is highly vulnerable to climate variability, climate change trends, and natural hazards. Key aspects of the CPF include:

1. Supporting Timor-Leste to meet its climate change commitments.
2. Improving natural resource management.
3. Building community resilience to climate change and natural hazards.
4. Partnering with other development partners to improve community disaster risk preparedness and build resilience against natural hazards through existing operations in agriculture and infrastructure.
5. Making adequate resources available to support implementation of environmental and social safeguards policies and build government capacity to better manage environmental risks.

Both the ADB and WBG strategies emphasize the importance of climate change adaptation and resilience-building in Timor-Leste's development path. They highlight the need for capacity building, improved infrastructure, and better natural resource management to address the country's climate vulnerabilities.

Conclusion:

Timor-Leste faces significant challenges from climate change, including rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, sea-level rise, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These changes are expected to have wide-ranging impacts on the country's natural resources, economic sectors (particularly agriculture and fisheries), and human health and wellbeing.

The country's high dependence on agriculture, limited infrastructure, and existing socio-economic challenges make it particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. However, Timor-Leste has taken important steps in developing national policies and strategies to address these challenges.

International partners, including the ADB and World Bank, are supporting Timor-Leste's efforts to build climate resilience and adapt to changing conditions. Their strategies emphasize the importance of integrating climate change considerations into all aspects of development planning and implementation.

Moving forward, key priorities for Timor-Leste include:

1. Strengthening climate-resilient agriculture and food security
2. Improving water resource management
3. Protecting coastal areas and marine resources
4. Enhancing disaster preparedness and response capabilities
5. Building adaptive capacity at both national and community levels
6. Integrating climate change considerations into all sectors of development planning

As Timor-Leste continues to develop, addressing these climate change challenges will be crucial for ensuring sustainable and resilient growth for its people and ecosystems.
15. CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS - Natural Resources - Water

Timor-Leste's water resources are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The country faces several challenges in water management, which are likely to be exacerbated by climate change:

1. Dependence on Groundwater:
   - Coastal areas in Timor-Leste are particularly dependent on groundwater.
   - More than 60% of Dili's total annual water supply for agriculture, industrial, and domestic purposes comes from groundwater sources.
   - Climate change threatens to impact groundwater recharge rates and quality.

2. Geographical and Climate Challenges:
   - Steep topography of catchment areas complicates water management.
   - Variable sediment runoff following flash-flood events affects water quality.
   - The wet-dry tropical monsoon climate creates seasonal variations in water availability.

3. Climate Change Projections:
   - Increased intensity and variability of rainfall are expected.
   - Sea-level rise will likely impact coastal aquifers.
   - These changes are projected to put pressure on both ground- and surface-water resources.

4. Increased Risk of Extreme Events:
   - Higher likelihood of both flooding and droughts.
   - Parts of northern Timor-Leste already experience water shortages in the dry season, which may worsen.

5. Water Access Issues:
   - Access to clean water is already a problem in some areas of the country.
   - Climate change, combined with large-scale deforestation, is contributing to the loss and drying up of water sources.

6. Impacts on Water Infrastructure:
   - Existing water infrastructure may be inadequate to handle increased variability in water availability.
   - More intense rainfall events could overwhelm current water management systems.

7. Socio-economic Implications:
   - Water scarcity could lead to increased competition for water resources between different sectors (agriculture, industry, domestic use).
   - Poor water quality and availability could have significant public health impacts.

These impacts highlight the need for comprehensive water resource management strategies in Timor-Leste that take into account both climate change projections and land use changes. Potential adaptation measures could include:

- Improving water storage capacity to manage increased variability in rainfall.
- Implementing water conservation measures and promoting efficient water use.
- Protecting and restoring watersheds to enhance natural water retention and quality.
- Upgrading water infrastructure to be more resilient to extreme weather events.
- Enhancing water quality monitoring and treatment capabilities.
- Developing integrated water resource management plans that consider the impacts of climate change.

Addressing these water-related challenges will be crucial for Timor-Leste's climate resilience and sustainable development.
16. CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS - Natural Resources - The Coastal Zone

Timor-Leste, as an island nation, is particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts on its coastal zones:

1. Sea-Level Rise:
   - Global mean sea-level rise is estimated to be 0.44-0.74 meters by the end of the 21st century.
   - For Timor-Leste, sea levels are projected to rise by 80-180 mm by 2030 under all RCP scenarios.
   - By 2090, under RCP8.5, sea-level rise could reach 430-880 mm.

2. Coastal Flooding:
   - Sea-level rise will increase the impact of storm surges and coastal flooding.
   - The capital, Dili, is particularly vulnerable, being situated only a few meters above sea level.
   - By 2070-2100, up to 7,200 people in Timor-Leste could be exposed to flooding from sea-level rise under RCP8.5.

3. Coastal Erosion:
   - Higher sea levels and more intense storms could accelerate coastal erosion.
   - This threatens coastal infrastructure, settlements, and ecosystems.

4. Saltwater Intrusion:
   - Rising sea levels may lead to saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers.
   - This could compromise freshwater resources in coastal areas.

5. Impact on Coastal Ecosystems:
   - Mangroves and coral reefs are at risk from sea-level rise and ocean acidification.
   - These ecosystems provide crucial services including coastal protection and fisheries support.

6. Socio-economic Implications:
   - Coastal communities may face displacement due to flooding and erosion.
   - Coastal agriculture could be impacted by salinization of soils and water resources.
   - Tourism, an emerging sector for Timor-Leste, may be affected by changes to coastal landscapes.

Adaptation strategies for the coastal zone could include:
- Implementing coastal protection measures, balancing hard infrastructure and nature-based solutions.
- Developing coastal zone management plans that account for future sea-level rise.
- Protecting and restoring coastal ecosystems like mangroves.
- Improving early warning systems for coastal hazards.
- Considering managed retreat from high-risk coastal areas.

17. CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS - Natural Resources - Biodiversity

Timor-Leste's unique and abundant biodiversity faces significant threats from climate change:

1. Range Shifts:
   - Climate change is expected to shift suitable habitats for many species.
   - On islands like Timor-Leste, upslope shifts may lead to habitat loss as species run out of suitable areas.

2. Thresholds and Tipping Points:
   - Some species may tolerate small climate changes but face extinction beyond certain thresholds.
   - For example, mangroves can tolerate sea-level rise of 3-18 cm, but are at risk from greater increases.

3. Marine Biodiversity:
   - Ocean acidification threatens coral reefs and associated marine life.
   - Changes in ocean temperatures may affect fish populations and migration patterns.

4. Terrestrial Biodiversity:
   - Changing temperature and rainfall patterns could impact forest ecosystems.
   - Endemic species with narrow habitat ranges are particularly vulnerable.

5. Invasive Species:
   - Climate change may create more favorable conditions for invasive species.
   - This could put additional pressure on native flora and fauna.

6. Ecosystem Services:
   - Changes in biodiversity could affect crucial ecosystem services.
   - This includes impacts on water regulation, soil fertility, and pollination.

7. Interactions with Other Stressors:
   - Climate change compounds other threats to biodiversity such as habitat loss and overexploitation.

Biodiversity conservation strategies in the face of climate change could include:
- Expanding and connecting protected areas to facilitate species movement.
- Implementing climate-smart conservation practices.
