## Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing input prompts for language models to generate desired outputs. It involves crafting prompts that effectively communicate the task, context, and desired format to the AI model.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and incorporates it into the generation process.

Example of implementing RAG:

```python
import openai
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Initialize the model and index
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(384)  # 384 is the embedding dimension for this model

# Sample knowledge base
knowledge_base = [
    "The capital of France is Paris.",
    "The Eiffel Tower is 324 meters tall.",
    "Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa.",
    "The Great Wall of China is over 21,000 kilometers long."
]

# Create embeddings and add to the index
embeddings = model.encode(knowledge_base)
index.add(embeddings)

def retrieve_context(query, k=2):
    query_vector = model.encode([query])
    _, I = index.search(query_vector, k)
    return [knowledge_base[i] for i in I[0]]

def generate_with_rag(prompt):
    context = retrieve_context(prompt)
    enhanced_prompt = f"Context: {' '.join(context)}\n\nQuestion: {prompt}\n\nAnswer:"
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=enhanced_prompt,
        max_tokens=100
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example usage
result = generate_with_rag("What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?")
print(result)
```

This example demonstrates how to implement a simple RAG system using sentence embeddings for retrieval and OpenAI's GPT-3 for generation.

## Prompt Types and Examples

1. Zero-shot Prompts:
   Ask the model to perform a task without any examples.

   ```
   Classify the following sentence as positive, negative, or neutral:
   "The movie was okay, but I've seen better."
   ```

2. Few-shot Prompts:
   Provide a few examples before asking the model to perform a task.

   ```
   Translate English to French:

   English: Hello
   French: Bonjour

   English: Goodbye
   French: Au revoir

   English: How are you?
   French:
   ```

3. Chain-of-Thought Prompts:
   Guide the model through a step-by-step reasoning process.

   ```
   Solve the following word problem step by step:
   
   John has 5 apples. He gives 2 apples to Sarah and buys 3 more from the store. How many apples does John have now?

   Step 1:
   ```

4. Self-consistency Prompts:
   Ask the model to generate multiple solutions and then find a consensus.

   ```
   Generate three different explanations for why the sky appears blue:

   Explanation 1:
   Explanation 2:
   Explanation 3:

   Now, provide a concise summary that captures the core idea present in all three explanations:
   ```

5. Persona-based Prompts:
   Instruct the model to adopt a specific persona or role.

   ```
   As a professional chef, provide a gourmet recipe for a chocolate souffl√©. Include ingredients and step-by-step instructions.
   ```

6. Constrained Output Prompts:
   Specify constraints on the format or content of the output.

   ```
   Write a haiku about autumn. Remember, a haiku consists of three lines with 5, 7, and 5 syllables respectively.
   ```

7. Comparative Prompts:
   Ask the model to compare and contrast different concepts.

   ```
   Compare and contrast renewable and non-renewable energy sources. Discuss their advantages and disadvantages in terms of environmental impact, cost, and reliability.
   ```

8. Socratic Prompts:
   Use a series of questions to guide the model's thinking process.

   ```
   Let's explore the concept of climate change:
   1. What is the greenhouse effect?
   2. How do human activities contribute to the greenhouse effect?
   3. What are some potential consequences of unchecked climate change?
   4. What are some strategies to mitigate climate change?
   ```

## Parameter Tuning

Different parameters can significantly affect the model's output. Here are some key parameters to experiment with:

1. Temperature:
   Controls the randomness of the output. Higher values (e.g., 0.8) make the output more diverse, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make it more deterministic.

   ```python
   response = openai.Completion.create(
       engine="text-davinci-002",
       prompt="Write a short story about a robot:",
       max_tokens=100,
       temperature=0.7
   )
   ```

2. Top-p (nucleus sampling):
   Sets a probability threshold for token selection. A value of 0.9 means the model will only consider tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds 90%.

   ```python
   response = openai.Completion.create(
       engine="text-davinci-002",
       prompt="List five unusual ice cream flavors:",
       max_tokens=50,
       top_p=0.9
   )
   ```

3. Frequency penalty:
   Reduces the likelihood of repetition by penalizing tokens based on their frequency in the generated text.

   ```python
   response = openai.Completion.create(
       engine="text-davinci-002",
       prompt="Write a paragraph without repeating any words:",
       max_tokens=100,
       frequency_penalty=1.0
   )
   ```

4. Presence penalty:
   Reduces the likelihood of repetition by penalizing tokens that have already appeared in the generated text.

   ```python
   response = openai.Completion.create(
       engine="text-davinci-002",
       prompt="Generate a diverse list of animals:",
       max_tokens=50,
       presence_penalty=0.8
   )
   ```

5. Max tokens:
   Limits the length of the generated text.

   ```python
   response = openai.Completion.create(
       engine="text-davinci-002",
       prompt="Summarize 'War and Peace' by Leo Tolstoy:",
       max_tokens=50
   )
   ```

6. Stop sequences:
   Specifies sequences that will stop the generation when encountered.

   ```python
   response = openai.Completion.create(
       engine="text-davinci-002",
       prompt="Write a dialogue between Alice and Bob:",
       max_tokens=100,
       stop=["\n", "Alice:", "Bob:"]
   )
   ```

## Advanced Techniques

1. Prompt Chaining:
   Use the output of one prompt as input for another.

   ```python
   def prompt_chain(initial_prompt):
       response1 = openai.Completion.create(
           engine="text-davinci-002",
           prompt=initial_prompt,
           max_tokens=50
       )
       
       intermediate_result = response1.choices[0].text.strip()
       
       response2 = openai.Completion.create(
           engine="text-davinci-002",
           prompt=f"Summarize the following in one sentence: {intermediate_result}",
           max_tokens=30
       )
       
       return response2.choices[0].text.strip()

   result = prompt_chain("Explain the process of photosynthesis")
   print(result)
   ```

2. Dynamic Prompt Generation:
   Generate prompts based on user input or context.

   ```python
   def generate_dynamic_prompt(topic, difficulty):
       base_prompt = f"Generate a {difficulty} level quiz question about {topic}."
       
       if difficulty == "easy":
           base_prompt += " The question should be straightforward and test basic knowledge."
       elif difficulty == "medium":
           base_prompt += " The question should require some thinking and application of concepts."
       elif difficulty == "hard":
           base_prompt += " The question should be challenging and test deep understanding of the subject."
       
       return base_prompt

   quiz_prompt = generate_dynamic_prompt("World War II", "medium")
   response = openai.Completion.create(
       engine="text-davinci-002",
       prompt=quiz_prompt,
       max_tokens=100
   )
   print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
   ```

3. Iterative Refinement:
   Use multiple rounds of generation and refinement to improve the output quality.

   ```python
   def iterative_refinement(initial_prompt, rounds=3):
       current_text = initial_prompt
       
       for i in range(rounds):
           response = openai.Completion.create(
               engine="text-davinci-002",
               prompt=f"Improve and expand upon the following text:\n\n{current_text}",
               max_tokens=100
           )
           current_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()
       
       return current_text

   final_text = iterative_refinement("The internet is a global network of computers.")
   print(final_text)
   ```

By experimenting with these different prompt types, parameters, and techniques, you can fine-tune your use of language models to achieve better results for various tasks. Remember that the effectiveness of prompts and parameters can vary depending on the specific task and model being used, so it's important to iterate and test different approaches.
