# PostgreSQL Basics: An Introduction to Relational Database Management

## Introduction
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its robustness, extensibility, and compliance with SQL standards. It provides a rich set of features, including support for advanced data types, complex queries, and transactions, making it a popular choice for applications that require a reliable and scalable database solution.

This paper introduces the fundamental concepts of PostgreSQL, including its command-line interface, data types, database and table management, and basic SQL operations. By understanding these concepts, users can effectively create, manage, and query databases using PostgreSQL.

## 1. Navigating the PostgreSQL Command-Line Interface (psql)
The PostgreSQL command-line interface, called `psql`, is a powerful tool for interacting with PostgreSQL databases. It allows users to execute SQL commands, view query results, and manage databases directly from the command line.

To start `psql`, open a terminal and type:

```bash
psql -U username -d database_name
```

Replace `username` with your PostgreSQL username and `database_name` with the name of the database you want to connect to. You will be prompted to enter the password for the specified user.

Once connected, you can use various `psql` commands to navigate and inspect the database structure. Some key commands include:

- `\l`: Lists all available databases in the PostgreSQL instance. This command provides an overview of the existing databases, along with their owners and encoding information.

- `\c database_name`: Connects to a specific database. Replace `database_name` with the name of the database you want to switch to. This command allows you to change the current working database within the `psql` session.

- `\dt`: Lists all tables in the current database. This command displays the names of the tables, along with their owners and the tablespace they belong to. It provides a quick way to see the structure of the database.

- `\d table_name`: Describes the structure of a specific table. Replace `table_name` with the name of the table you want to inspect. This command shows the column names, data types, constraints, and other attributes of the table, helping you understand its structure and relationships.

- `\q`: Quits the `psql` session. Use this command when you are finished working with the database and want to exit the command-line interface.

Example:
```psql
postgres=# \l
                                  List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges
-----------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------
 postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 |
 school    | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 |
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
(4 rows)

postgres=# \c school
You are now connected to database "school" as user "postgres".

school=# \dt
          List of relations
 Schema |  Name   | Type  |  Owner
--------+---------+-------+----------
 public | courses | table | postgres
 public | students| table | postgres
(2 rows)

school=# \d students
                      Table "public.students"
   Column   |          Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default
------------+------------------------+-----------+----------+---------
 id         | integer                |           | not null |
 name       | character varying(100) |           | not null |
 email      | character varying(100) |           |          |
 birth_date | date                   |           |          |
 gpa        | numeric(3,2)           |           |          |
Indexes:
    "students_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
    "students_email_key" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (email)

school=# \q
```

In this example, we start by listing all available databases using `\l`. We then connect to the `school` database using `\c school`. Once connected, we list the tables in the `school` database using `\dt`, which shows the `courses` and `students` tables. We describe the structure of the `students` table using `\d students`, displaying its columns, data types, constraints, and indexes. Finally, we quit the `psql` session using `\q`.

These commands allow users to navigate and inspect the database structure efficiently, providing a quick way to explore and understand the database layout.

## 2. PostgreSQL Data Types
PostgreSQL supports a wide range of data types, allowing you to store and manipulate various kinds of data efficiently. Choosing the appropriate data type for each column in a table is crucial for ensuring data integrity, optimizing storage, and enabling effective querying and processing.

Here are some commonly used PostgreSQL data types:

1. **Numeric Types**:
   - `INT` or `INTEGER`: Represents whole numbers, such as counts or quantities. It can store values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
   - `SERIAL`: An auto-incrementing integer column. It automatically generates a unique sequential number for each new row inserted into the table.
   - `NUMERIC(p,s)`: Stores exact decimal numbers with a specified precision and scale. The `p` parameter represents the total number of digits, and `s` represents the number of digits after the decimal point.

2. **Character Types**:
   - `VARCHAR(n)`: Stores variable-length strings with a maximum length specified by `n`. It is used for storing text data of varying sizes, such as names or addresses.
   - `TEXT`: Stores variable-length strings with no predefined limit. It is suitable for storing large amounts of text data, such as articles or descriptions.

3. **Date/Time Types**:
   - `DATE`: Represents a calendar date without a time component. It stores values in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
   - `TIME`: Represents a time of day without a date component. It stores values in the format 'HH:MM:SS'.
   - `TIMESTAMP`: Stores both date and time information. It includes the date, time, and optionally, the time zone.

4. **Boolean Type**:
   - `BOOLEAN`: Represents a logical value of either true or false. It is commonly used for storing binary states or flags.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  hire_date DATE,
  salary NUMERIC(10,2),
  is_active BOOLEAN
);
```

In this example, we create an `employees` table with various data types:
- The `id` column is defined as `SERIAL`, which automatically generates a unique identifier for each employee.
- The `name` column is defined as `VARCHAR(100)`, allowing storage of employee names up to 100 characters.
- The `email` column is also defined as `VARCHAR(100)` and has a `UNIQUE` constraint to ensure each email is unique.
- The `hire_date` column is defined as `DATE` to store the employee's hiring date.
- The `salary` column is defined as `NUMERIC(10,2)`, allowing storage of salaries with up to 10 digits, including 2 decimal places.
- The `is_active` column is defined as `BOOLEAN` to indicate whether an employee is currently active or not.

Choosing the appropriate data type for each column helps maintain data integrity, optimize storage, and facilitate efficient querying and data manipulation. It is important to consider the nature of the data, the range of values, and the required precision when selecting data types for your table columns.

## 3. Creating and Managing Databases and Tables
In PostgreSQL, databases are the top-level containers that hold all the data and database objects, such as tables, indexes, and views. Tables are the fundamental structures within a database where the actual data is stored and organized.

To create a new database in PostgreSQL, you can use the `CREATE DATABASE` statement:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE school;
```

This statement creates a new database named `school`. You can replace `school` with the desired name for your database.

Once you have a database, you can create tables within it using the `CREATE TABLE` statement. The `CREATE TABLE` statement allows you to define the structure of the table, specifying the column names, data types, and any constraints or additional properties.

Here's an example of creating a table named `students`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  birth_date DATE,
  gpa NUMERIC(3,2)
);
```

Let's break down the different parts of this `CREATE TABLE` statement:

- `id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`: This line creates a column named `id` with the `SERIAL` data type. The `SERIAL` data type automatically generates a unique sequential number for each new row inserted into the table. The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint ensures that the `id` column uniquely identifies each row in the table.

- `name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL`: This line creates a column named `name` with the `VARCHAR(100)` data type, allowing storage of names up to 100 characters. The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that a value must be provided for the `name` column in every row.

- `email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE`: This line creates a column named `email` with the `VARCHAR(100)` data type. The `UNIQUE` constraint ensures that each email address in the table is unique, preventing duplicate email entries.

- `birth_date DATE`: This line creates a column named `birth_date` with the `DATE` data type to store the birth dates of students.

- `gpa NUMERIC(3,2)`: This line creates a column named `gpa` with the `NUMERIC(3,2)` data type, allowing storage of grade point averages with up to 3 digits, including 2 decimal places.

By specifying the column names, data types, and constraints in the `CREATE TABLE` statement, you define the structure of the table and enforce data integrity rules.

You can create multiple tables within a database, each representing a different entity or concept in your application. For example, you might have additional tables like `courses`, `enrollments`, or `instructors` to store related information.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  instructor_id INTEGER REFERENCES instructors(id)
);
```

In this example, we create a `courses` table with columns for `id`, `name`, `description`, and `instructor_id`. The `instructor_id` column is defined as a foreign key using the `REFERENCES` keyword, establishing a relationship between the `courses` table and the `instructors` table based on the `id` column.

Creating well-structured tables with appropriate data types, constraints, and relationships is crucial for building a robust and efficient database schema. It helps maintain data integrity, enforce business rules, and facilitate effective querying and data retrieval.

## 4. Data Manipulation: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
Once you have created tables in your PostgreSQL database, you can start manipulating the data stored in those tables using SQL statements. The three main data manipulation operations are `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

1. **INSERT**: The `INSERT` statement is used to add new records or rows into a table. It allows you to specify the values to be inserted for each column in the table.

   Here's an example of inserting a new student record into the `students` table:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO students (name, email, birth_date, gpa)
   VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com', '2000-01-15', 3.75);
   ```

   In this statement, we specify the table name (`students`) and the columns (`name`, `email`, `birth_date`, `gpa`) into which we want to insert values. The `VALUES` clause provides the corresponding values for each column. The values are listed in the same order as the specified columns.

   If you want to insert multiple records in a single statement, you can include multiple sets of values separated by commas:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO students (name, email, birth_date, gpa)
   VALUES
     ('Jane Smith', 'jane@example.com', '2001-03-20', 3.90),
     ('Mark Johnson', 'mark@example.com', '1999-11-05', 3.60);
   ```

   This statement inserts two new student records into the `students` table.

2. **UPDATE**: The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns based on specified conditions.

   Here's an example of updating the GPA of a student with a specific name:

   ```sql
   UPDATE students SET gpa = 3.80 WHERE name = 'John Doe';
   ```

   In this statement, we specify the table name (`students`) and use the `SET` clause to indicate the column (`gpa`) and its new value (`3.80`). The `WHERE` clause specifies the condition that determines which record(s) should be updated. In this case, it updates the GPA of the student whose name is 'John Doe'.

   You can update multiple columns in a single `UPDATE` statement by separating the column-value pairs with commas:

   ```sql
   UPDATE students
   SET email = 'johndoe@example.com', gpa = 3.85
   WHERE id = 1;
   ```

   This statement updates both the `email` and `gpa` columns for the student with `id` equal to 1.

   It's important to be cautious when using `UPDATE` statements without a `WHERE` clause, as it will update all the records in the table.

3. **DELETE**: The `DELETE` statement is used to remove one or more records from a table based on specified conditions.

   Here's an example of deleting a student record with a specific name:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM students WHERE name = 'John Doe';
   ```

   In this statement, we specify the table name (`students`) and use the `WHERE` clause to indicate the condition that determines which record(s) should be deleted. In this case, it deletes the student record where the name is 'John Doe'.

   Similar to `UPDATE`, be cautious when using `DELETE` statements without a `WHERE` clause, as it will remove all the records from the table.

Example:
```sql
-- Insert a new student
INSERT INTO students (name, email, birth_date, gpa)
VALUES ('Sarah Thompson', 'sarah@example.com', '2002-07-10', 3.95);

-- Update the email of a student
UPDATE students
SET email = 'sarahthompson@example.com'
WHERE name = 'Sarah Thompson';

-- Delete a student record
DELETE FROM students
WHERE id = 5;
```

In this example, we first insert a new student record into the `students` table. Then, we update the email of the student with the name 'Sarah Thompson'. Finally, we delete the student record with `id` equal to 5.

Data manipulation operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) are essential for managing the data stored in your PostgreSQL tables. They allow you to add new records, modify existing data, and remove unwanted records based on specific conditions. It's crucial to use these operations carefully and ensure that the appropriate conditions are specified to maintain data integrity and avoid unintended modifications or deletions.

## 5. Basic Queries with SELECT
The `SELECT` statement is one of the most fundamental and commonly used SQL statements in PostgreSQL. It allows you to retrieve data from one or more tables based on specified criteria. The basic syntax of a `SELECT` statement is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Here's a breakdown of the different parts of a `SELECT` statement:

1. Selecting all columns:
   To retrieve all columns from a table, you can use the asterisk (`*`) wildcard character in the `SELECT` clause.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM students;
   ```

   This statement selects all columns from the `students` table and returns all the records.

2. Selecting specific columns:
   If you only need specific columns from a table, you can list them individually in the `SELECT` clause.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, gpa FROM students;
   ```

   This statement selects only the `name` and `gpa` columns from the `students` table.

3. Filtering results with WHERE:
   The `WHERE` clause allows you to specify conditions to filter the results based on specific criteria.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, gpa FROM students WHERE gpa > 3.5;
   ```

   This statement selects the `name` and `gpa` columns from the `students` table for records where the `gpa` is greater than 3.5.

4. Ordering results:
   You can use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results based on one or more columns. By default, the sorting is in ascending order. You can use `DESC` for descending order.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, gpa FROM students ORDER BY gpa DESC;
   ```

   This statement selects the `name` and `gpa` columns from the `students` table and orders the results by `gpa` in descending order.

5. Joining tables:
   The `JOIN` clause allows you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are different types of joins, such as `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.

   ```sql
   SELECT students.name, courses.name AS course_name
   FROM students
   INNER JOIN enrollments ON students.id = enrollments.student_id
   INNER JOIN courses ON enrollments.course_id = courses.id;
   ```

   This statement retrieves the student name and the corresponding course name by joining the `students`, `enrollments`, and `courses` tables based on the specified conditions.

6. Aggregating data:
   You can use aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to perform calculations on a set of rows.

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_students FROM students;
   SELECT AVG(gpa) AS average_gpa FROM students;
   ```

   These statements calculate the total number of students and the average GPA using the `COUNT` and `AVG` functions, respectively.

Example:
```sql
-- Select all columns from the students table
SELECT * FROM students;

-- Select specific columns and filter results
SELECT name, email
FROM students
WHERE gpa >= 3.8;

-- Order results by GPA in descending order
SELECT name, gpa
FROM students
ORDER BY gpa DESC;

-- Join tables and select specific columns
SELECT students.name, courses.name AS course_name, enrollments.grade
FROM students
INNER JOIN enrollments ON students.id = enrollments.student_id
INNER JOIN courses ON enrollments.course_id = courses.id
WHERE enrollments.grade >= 'B';
```

These queries demonstrate selecting all columns, selecting specific columns with filtering, ordering results, joining tables, and selecting specific columns from the joined tables with a condition.

The `SELECT` statement, along with its various clauses and options, provides a powerful way to retrieve and manipulate data from PostgreSQL tables. It allows you to filter, sort, join, and aggregate data based on your specific requirements, enabling you to extract meaningful insights from your database.
