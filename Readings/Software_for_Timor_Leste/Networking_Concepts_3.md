# Layer 3 Networking Concepts

Layer 3, also known as the Network layer, is the third layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for logical addressing and routing data packets between different networks. The Network layer ensures that data is correctly addressed and delivered to its intended destination, even if the source and destination devices are on different networks. In this paper, we will explore several key concepts related to Layer 3 networking, including IP addressing (IPv4 and IPv6), subnetting basics, routing concepts, and Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT).

## IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)

Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are logical addresses assigned to devices on a network to identify them uniquely and enable communication between them. There are two main versions of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6.

### IPv4 Addressing

IPv4 addresses are 32-bit addresses represented in dotted-decimal notation, consisting of four octets separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1). Each octet ranges from 0 to 255, allowing for a total of approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.

An IPv4 address is divided into two parts: the network portion and the host portion. The network portion identifies the network to which the device belongs, while the host portion identifies the specific device within that network. The division between the network and host portions is determined by the subnet mask, which is a 32-bit value that masks out the host portion of the address.

IPv4 addresses are divided into five classes (A, B, C, D, and E) based on the value of the first octet. Classes A, B, and C are used for unicast addressing, while Class D is used for multicast and Class E is reserved for experimental purposes.

### IPv6 Addressing

IPv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses represented in hexadecimal notation, consisting of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). IPv6 was introduced to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and provide a larger address space.

IPv6 addresses are divided into two parts: the network prefix and the interface identifier. The network prefix identifies the network to which the device belongs, while the interface identifier identifies the specific device within that network. IPv6 uses a prefix length notation (e.g., /64) to indicate the number of bits in the network prefix.

IPv6 addresses can be abbreviated by omitting leading zeros within each group and replacing consecutive groups of zeros with a double colon (::). For example, the address 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 can be written as 2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334.

## Subnetting Basics

Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller subnetworks (subnets) to improve network performance, security, and management. Subnetting allows network administrators to allocate IP addresses efficiently and control network traffic.

To create subnets, the host portion of an IP address is borrowed to create additional network bits. The subnet mask determines which portion of the address represents the network and which portion represents the host.

For example, consider a Class C network with the address 192.168.1.0 and the default subnet mask 255.255.255.0. By borrowing two bits from the host portion, we can create four subnets:

- 192.168.1.0/26 (subnet mask 255.255.255.192)
- 192.168.1.64/26 (subnet mask 255.255.255.192)
- 192.168.1.128/26 (subnet mask 255.255.255.192)
- 192.168.1.192/26 (subnet mask 255.255.255.192)

Each subnet can accommodate up to 62 host addresses (64 minus 2 for the network and broadcast addresses).

When designing subnets, network administrators must consider factors such as the number of required subnets, the number of hosts per subnet, and the growth potential of the network.

## Routing Concepts

Routing is the process of forwarding data packets between networks based on their destination IP addresses. Routers are Layer 3 devices that connect different networks and use routing tables to determine the best path for data to travel from source to destination.

Routers exchange routing information using routing protocols, which can be classified as either interior gateway protocols (IGPs) or exterior gateway protocols (EGPs). IGPs, such as RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP, are used within a single autonomous system (AS), while EGPs, like BGP, are used between different autonomous systems.

### Static Routing

Static routing involves manually configuring routes on a router. Network administrators specify the destination network, the next-hop IP address or exit interface, and optionally, a metric (cost) for each route. Static routes are useful for small, stable networks or for defining default routes.

Example of a static route configuration:

```
ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2
```

This command configures a static route to the network 192.168.2.0/24, specifying that packets should be forwarded to the next-hop IP address 10.0.0.2.

### Dynamic Routing

Dynamic routing uses routing protocols to automatically exchange routing information between routers. Routers learn about networks from their neighbors and update their routing tables accordingly. Dynamic routing is more scalable and adaptable than static routing, making it suitable for larger, more complex networks.

Common dynamic routing protocols include:

- RIP (Routing Information Protocol): A distance-vector protocol that uses hop count as its metric.
- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First): A link-state protocol that uses cost as its metric and supports hierarchical network design.
- EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol): A hybrid protocol that combines features of distance-vector and link-state protocols, offering fast convergence and efficient use of bandwidth.

## NAT and PAT

Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT) are techniques used to conserve public IP addresses and enable communication between private and public networks.

### NAT

NAT allows multiple devices in a private network to share a single public IP address. When a device in the private network sends a packet to the public network, the NAT router replaces the private source IP address with its own public IP address. When the response packet arrives, the NAT router translates the public IP address back to the original private IP address and forwards the packet to the appropriate device.

NAT helps conserve public IP addresses and provides a level of security by hiding the internal network structure from the public network.

### PAT

Port Address Translation (PAT), also known as NAT overloading, is an extension of NAT that allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address and port. PAT uses unique source port numbers to distinguish between different connections from the same private IP address.

When a device in the private network sends a packet to the public network, the PAT router replaces the private source IP address and port with its own public IP address and a unique source port. The PAT router maintains a translation table to keep track of the mappings between private and public IP addresses and ports.

PAT is commonly used in home and small office networks, where a single public IP address is assigned by the Internet Service Provider (ISP).

## Demonstration: Using 'ip addr' and 'ip route' Commands

In Linux, the 'ip addr' and 'ip route' commands are used to view and configure IP addresses and routing tables.

### Viewing IP Addresses

To view the IP addresses assigned to network interfaces, use the 'ip addr show' command:

```bash
ip addr show
```

This command displays a list of all network interfaces and their associated IP addresses, along with additional information such as the link-local address, broadcast address, and network mask.

### Configuring IP Addresses

To assign an IP address to a network interface, use the 'ip addr add' command:

```bash
ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0
```

This command assigns the IP address 192.168.1.10 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (prefix length /24) to the eth0 interface.

### Viewing Routing Table

To view the routing table, use the 'ip route show' command:

```bash
ip route show
```

This command displays the current routing table, including the destination networks, gateways, and metrics.

### Configuring Static Routes

To add a static route, use the 'ip route add' command:

```bash
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 10.0.0.2
```

This command adds a static route to the network 192.168.2.0/24, specifying that packets should be forwarded to the next-hop IP address 10.0.0.2.

By using the 'ip addr' and 'ip route' commands, network administrators can view and modify Layer 3 configurations, including IP addresses and routing tables, making them essential tools for managing and troubleshooting Linux networking.
