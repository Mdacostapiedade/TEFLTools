# Overview of Version Control 

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to:

- Revert selected files back to a previous state
- Revert the entire project back to a previous state
- Compare changes over time
- See who last modified something that might be causing a problem
- Recover lost files or project states

Version control systems (VCS) can be:

1. Local: Versions are stored on your local computer (e.g., RCS)
2. Centralized: Versions are stored on a central server (e.g., SVN)
3. Distributed: Each user has a complete copy of the repository (e.g., Git)

Benefits of using version control:

- Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same project files simultaneously
- History: Complete long-term change history of every file is maintained
- Branching and merging: Create separate branches for experimentation, then merge approved changes
- Revert: Undo mistakes by reverting to earlier versions

Git is a popular distributed version control system known for its speed, flexibility, and robust branching and merging capabilities.
