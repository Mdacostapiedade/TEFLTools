# Summary: Basics of Data Analytics and Metrics for Timor-Leste

## Introduction

This paper summarizes a comprehensive one-week course designed to introduce the basics of data analytics and metrics, with a specific focus on applications in Timor-Leste. The course is structured into five sessions, each lasting two hours, covering fundamental concepts and practical skills in data analytics.

## Course Structure and Content

### Session 1: Introduction to Data Analytics

The course begins by establishing a foundational understanding of data analytics, its importance, and various types. Students are introduced to descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. A case study analysis demonstrates the real-world application of data analytics in decision-making, with a particular emphasis on scenarios relevant to Timor-Leste.

### Session 2: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Metrics

This session focuses on the crucial concepts of KPIs and metrics. Students learn to identify and define relevant metrics for different scenarios, applying the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to ensure effectiveness. The practical component involves defining KPIs for a Timor-Leste development project, bridging theoretical knowledge with local context.

### Session 3: Data Collection and Preparation

The third session delves into various data collection methods and the importance of data quality. Students learn about surveys, observations, and existing databases as sources of data. The session emphasizes the critical dimensions of data quality: accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness. Hands-on practice in cleaning and preparing a messy dataset from Timor-Leste provides practical experience.

### Session 4: Basic Statistical Analysis

This session introduces students to fundamental statistical concepts. Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation are covered, along with an introduction to inferential statistics, including hypothesis testing and p-values. Students apply these concepts by analyzing a dataset on Timor-Leste's economic indicators, making the learning directly relevant to their local context.

### Session 5: Interpreting and Communicating Results

The final session focuses on interpreting analytical results and effectively communicating findings to stakeholders. Students learn to draw conclusions, recognize limitations in their analysis, and present their insights through reports, presentations, and dashboards. The practical component involves creating a brief report on Timor-Leste's development progress, synthesizing the skills learned throughout the course.

## Assessment and Final Project

The course employs a multi-faceted assessment approach, including daily homework assignments, in-class participation, and hands-on exercises. The culmination of the course is a comprehensive final project where students apply their learned skills to a relevant issue or sector in Timor-Leste.

The final project requires students to:
1. Choose a relevant issue or sector in Timor-Leste
2. Develop a complete data analytics plan
3. Create a report and presentation summarizing findings and recommendations
4. Present the project to the class

This project-based approach ensures that students can apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios in Timor-Leste, making the learning outcomes immediately applicable and relevant.

## Contextual Relevance to Timor-Leste

A key strength of this course is its consistent focus on Timor-Leste. Throughout the sessions, examples, datasets, and practical exercises are tailored to the Timorese context. This approach not only makes the learning more relevant for the students but also prepares them to apply data analytics skills to address real challenges and opportunities in their country.

Examples of Timor-Leste-specific elements include:
- Analyzing economic indicators of Timor-Leste
- Designing data collection plans for local communities
- Developing KPIs for local businesses
- Studying health outcomes and education data from Timor-Leste

## Conclusion

This one-week course provides a comprehensive introduction to data analytics and metrics, with a strong focus on practical application in the context of Timor-Leste. By combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice using local data and scenarios, the course equips students with the skills to leverage data analytics in addressing real-world challenges and opportunities in Timor-Leste. The project-based learning approach ensures that students can immediately apply their skills to contribute to data-driven decision-making in various sectors of Timorese society and economy.
