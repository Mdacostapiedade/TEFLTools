# Introduction to Relational Databases: Concepts and Structure

## 1. What is a Database?

A database is a structured collection of persistent data that is organized for efficient storage, management, and retrieval. In the context of computer science and information systems, a database serves as a central repository for storing and managing data that can be accessed and manipulated by various applications and users.

Databases are crucial in modern software development, powering a wide range of applications from simple mobile apps to complex enterprise systems. They provide a reliable and scalable way to store and manage large amounts of data, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and availability.

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that facilitates the creation, maintenance, and querying of databases. It provides a layer of abstraction between the physical storage of data and the applications that use it, allowing developers to interact with the database using high-level query languages and APIs.

Popular DBMS examples include:
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational DBMS known for its reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
- **MySQL**: A widely-used open-source relational DBMS, popular for web applications and content management systems.
- **Oracle Database**: A commercial relational DBMS used in many large-scale enterprise applications.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: A commercial relational DBMS developed by Microsoft, commonly used in Windows-based environments.

These systems provide tools and interfaces for creating and managing databases, executing queries, and ensuring data integrity. They also offer features like transaction management, concurrency control, and backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure the reliability and consistency of the data.

### Vocabulary

- **Data Persistence**: The property of data that ensures it survives beyond the scope of the process that created it. In the context of databases, persistence means that data is stored on a stable storage medium and can be accessed and retrieved even after the application or system that created it has been shut down.
- **Query**: A request for data or information from a database. Queries are typically written in a specialized query language, such as SQL (Structured Query Language), and are used to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data from the database.
- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules, protocols, and tools that define how software components should interact. In the context of databases, an API provides a way for applications to communicate with the DBMS and perform operations on the database.

## 2. Relational Databases

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into one or more tables (also called relations) based on the relational model proposed by E.F. Codd in 1970. The relational model provides a mathematical foundation for representing and manipulating data in a structured and consistent manner.

In a relational database, each table consists of a set of rows (also known as tuples or records) and columns (also called attributes or fields). Rows represent individual instances of an entity, while columns define the attributes or properties of that entity.

The "relational" aspect of these databases comes from the ability to establish relationships between tables based on common attributes. This allows for the creation of complex data structures and enables powerful querying capabilities.

### Key Components of a Relational Database:

1. **Tables**: Tables are the primary structures for storing data in a relational database. Each table represents a specific entity or concept, such as Students, Courses, or Employees. Tables are composed of rows and columns, with each row representing a unique instance of the entity and each column representing an attribute of that entity.

2. **Rows**: Rows, also known as tuples or records, represent individual instances of an entity within a table. Each row contains data values for the attributes defined by the table's columns. For example, in a Students table, each row would represent a particular student, with values for attributes like student_id, name, and age.

3. **Columns**: Columns, also known as attributes or fields, define the structure and properties of an entity within a table. Each column has a name and a data type that specifies the kind of data it can store, such as integers, strings, or dates. Columns provide a way to organize and categorize the data within a table.

4. **Schema**: The schema of a relational database refers to the overall structure and organization of the database. It includes the definition of tables, their columns, data types, relationships between tables, and any constraints or rules that govern the data. The schema provides a blueprint for the database and ensures data consistency and integrity.

### Vocabulary

- **Relational Model**: A mathematical model for representing and manipulating data based on the concept of relations (tables). It defines the structure, integrity constraints, and operations that can be performed on the data.
- **Tuple**: A synonym for a row in a relational database table. It represents a single, structured data item that consists of a sequence of values, each corresponding to an attribute of the table.
- **Attribute**: A synonym for a column in a relational database table. It represents a specific property or characteristic of an entity.
- **Data Type**: A classification of data that specifies the kind of values a column can store, such as integers, strings, dates, or Boolean values. Data types enforce data integrity and consistency within the database.

## 3. Keys in Relational Databases

Keys are fundamental concepts in relational databases that help establish uniqueness, identify records, and create relationships between tables. The two main types of keys are primary keys and foreign keys.

1. **Primary Key**: A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row within a table. It ensures that each record in the table is uniquely identifiable and can be accessed and manipulated independently. Primary keys are typically used as references by other tables to establish relationships.

   Characteristics of a primary key:
   - Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique within the table.
   - Non-nullability: Primary key values cannot be null (empty or missing).
   - Stability: Primary key values should not change over time.

   For example, in a Students table, the student_id column can serve as the primary key, as each student is assigned a unique identifier.

2. **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, allowing for the enforcement of referential integrity and enabling the creation of complex data structures.

   Characteristics of a foreign key:
   - Referential integrity: The foreign key values must correspond to existing primary key values in the referenced table.
   - Cascading actions: Foreign keys can define cascading actions, such as cascading updates or deletes, to maintain data consistency when changes occur in the referenced table.

   For example, in an Enrollments table that connects Students and Courses, the student_id column would be a foreign key referencing the primary key of the Students table, and the course_id column would be a foreign key referencing the primary key of the Courses table.

### Vocabulary

- **Referential Integrity**: A constraint that ensures the consistency and validity of data relationships between tables. It requires that foreign key values in one table must correspond to existing primary key values in the referenced table.
- **Candidate Key**: A column or set of columns that could potentially serve as the primary key for a table. Candidate keys satisfy the uniqueness and non-nullability requirements of a primary key.
- **Composite Key**: A primary key that consists of multiple columns. Composite keys are used when a single column is not sufficient to uniquely identify records in a table.
- **Surrogate Key**: An artificial key generated by the database system to serve as the primary key for a table. Surrogate keys are often used when no natural candidate key exists or when using a natural key would be impractical.

## 4. Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams

Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams are visual tools used to represent the structure and relationships of a database. They provide a high-level view of the database schema and help in designing, communicating, and understanding the database design.

Key components of ER diagrams:

1. **Entities**: Entities are the main objects or concepts in the database system. They are represented as rectangles in the ER diagram and correspond to tables in the physical database. Examples of entities include Students, Courses, and Employees.

2. **Attributes**: Attributes are the properties or characteristics of an entity. They are represented as ovals connected to the entity rectangle in the ER diagram. Attributes correspond to columns in the physical database table. For example, the Students entity might have attributes like student_id, name, and age.

3. **Relationships**: Relationships describe how entities are related to each other. They are represented as diamonds in the ER diagram, connecting the participating entities. Relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. For example, the "enrolls in" relationship between Students and Courses indicates that a student can enroll in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple students.

4. **Cardinality**: Cardinality specifies the number of instances of one entity that can be related to the number of instances of another entity. It is represented by symbols or annotations near the relationship diamond. Common cardinality types include:
   - One-to-one (1:1): Each instance of one entity is related to at most one instance of the other entity.
   - One-to-many (1:N): Each instance of one entity can be related to multiple instances of the other entity, but each instance of the other entity is related to at most one instance of the first entity.
   - Many-to-many (M:N): Each instance of one entity can be related to multiple instances of the other entity, and vice versa.

### Vocabulary

- **Weak Entity**: An entity that depends on another entity for its existence. A weak entity does not have a primary key of its own and is identified by a combination of its attributes and the primary key of the entity it depends on.
- **Associative Entity**: An entity that represents the relationship between two or more entities when the relationship itself has attributes. Associative entities are often used to resolve many-to-many relationships.
- **Cardinality Ratio**: The number of instances of one entity that can be related to the number of instances of another entity. Common cardinality ratios include 1:1, 1:N, and M:N.
- **Participation Constraint**: A constraint that specifies whether the existence of an entity depends on its relationship with another entity. Participation constraints can be either mandatory (an entity must participate in the relationship) or optional (an entity may or may not participate in the relationship).

## Example: A Simple University Database

Consider a simple university database with two main entities: Students and Courses.

1. **Students Table**:
   - Columns: student_id (Primary Key), name, age
   - Example Row: (1, "Alice", 20)

2. **Courses Table**:
   - Columns: course_id (Primary Key), title, credits
   - Example Row: (101, "Introduction to Python", 3)

3. **Enrollments Table** (represents the many-to-many relationship between Students and Courses):
   - Columns: enrollment_id (Primary Key), student_id (Foreign Key referencing Students table), course_id (Foreign Key referencing Courses table)
   - Example Row: (1, 1, 101)

An ER diagram for this university database would include:
- Two entity rectangles: Students and Courses
- Attributes (ovals) connected to each entity, representing columns like student_id, name, age, course_id, title, and credits
- A relationship diamond: "enrolls in" connecting the Students and Courses entities
- Cardinality indicators showing that a student can enroll in multiple courses (1:N) and a course can have multiple students (M:N)
- The Enrollments associative entity connecting Students and Courses, with foreign keys student_id and course_id

This example demonstrates how entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinality are represented in an ER diagram to provide a visual overview of the database structure.
