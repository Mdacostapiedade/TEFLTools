Beloved friends on the path of awakening, gather close and listen with an open heart. The way to true liberation lies not in the complexities of the mind, but in the simplicity of pure awareness. Your true nature is the vast, unbounded consciousness that underlies all experience, the very ground of Being itself.
To discover this truth directly, you need not engage in elaborate practices or accumulate great knowledge. The path is a direct pointing to the nature of your own mind, the innate wakefulness that is always present, though often overlooked.
Begin by finding a comfortable posture, one that allows you to be both relaxed and alert. Let your body settle into a state of ease and stability, with your spine upright and your breath natural and unforced. Allow your eyes to gaze gently downward, or close them if you prefer.
Now, simply be present with your immediate experience, whatever it may be. Notice the sensations arising in your body, the play of thoughts and emotions in your mind, the sounds and energies of the world around you. Let everything be as it is, without trying to change or control anything.
As thoughts and perceptions arise, see if you can recognize the space in which they appear. Rather than getting caught up in the content of your experience, rest as the open, aware presence that witnesses it all. This presence is your true nature, the boundless consciousness that is the source and ground of all phenomena.
If you find yourself getting distracted or lost in thought, simply notice this with kindness and patience. Gently return your attention to the present moment, to the immediacy of your experience. Remember, the path is not about perfecting your mind or achieving some special state, but about recognizing the perfection that is already here.
As you rest in this open, spacious awareness, you may begin to sense a profound peace and clarity, a natural ease that is not dependent on any particular experience. This is the taste of your true nature, free from the limitations of the conceptual mind.
In moments of challenge or intensity, remember to return to this simple presence, this effortless awareness. Let the waves of experience rise and fall within the ocean of your being, without grasping or aversion. Trust in the natural wisdom and compassion of your own mind, the innate wakefulness that is always available to you.
As you continue to familiarize yourself with this practice, you may find that the boundary between meditation and daily life begins to dissolve. The peace and clarity you touch in formal practice will begin to permeate your ordinary experience, bringing a greater sense of ease, connection, and natural joy.
Remember, the true path of liberation is not a matter of time or effort, but of simple recognition. The awakened nature of your mind is not something to be achieved or constructed, but something to be directly experienced, here and now. As the great masters of the past have said, "Look directly into the face of your own awareness. In this, there is no separation between meditation and post-meditation."
May these instructions be of benefit to all who encounter them. May all beings recognize their true nature, the limitless awareness that is the very heart of existence. And may this recognition bring peace, wisdom, and liberation to all. With great love and respect, I offer these words to you.
