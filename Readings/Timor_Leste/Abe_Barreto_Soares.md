# Abé Barreto Soares: The Poetic Voice of Timor-Leste's Soul

In the realm of Timorese literature and cultural identity, Abé Barreto Soares stands as a towering figure whose poetry and message have played a crucial role in shaping the nation's consciousness. Soares, a poet, musician, and cultural ambassador, has woven the threads of Timor-Leste's history, struggle, and aspirations into a tapestry of words that resonates deeply with his people and beyond. This article delves into Soares' poetic message, exploring the themes, styles, and significance of his work in the context of Timor-Leste's journey from colonization to independence and nation-building.

## The Voice of the Crocodile: Rooted in Timorese Soil

At the heart of Soares' poetic message lies a profound connection to the land and traditions of Timor-Leste. He often refers to his poetic voice as "the voice of the crocodile," drawing on the creation myth of Timor-Leste, which tells of the island being formed from the body of a crocodile. This metaphor encapsulates Soares' approach to poetry: deeply rooted in Timorese soil yet capable of powerful, transformative movement.

One of Soares' most evocative poems that exemplifies this connection is "I saw my own reflection" (1991), written during his exile in Toronto:

```
Ramelau
I came over to your
transparent pond
At its shore
I saw my own reflection
naked
welcoming me
then told me
the winding story
of the roots
of my seed
```

This poem, invoking Mount Ramelau, Timor-Leste's highest peak, speaks to the deep spiritual and cultural connection Timorese people have with their land. The reflection in the pond becomes a metaphor for self-discovery and cultural identity, with the mountain serving as a keeper of the nation's history and heritage.

Soares emphasizes the sacredness of this connection through his use of Tetum language concepts. He offers a linguistic progression that mirrors the deepening relationship between person and land:
- "sama rai" (step on the soil)
- "ha'u sama rai" (I step on the soil)
- "ha'u hamrik metin" (I firmly stand on the soil)
- "ha'u tuba-rai metin" (I firmly step on the soil)

This progression illustrates how Soares views humans as inseparable from their environment, "as a plant growing from the soil." This theme recurs throughout his work, reinforcing the idea that Timorese identity is inextricably linked to the land.

## Poetry as Revolutionary Act

For Soares, poetry is not merely an artistic expression but a revolutionary act. He draws inspiration from revolutionary figures who were also writers, such as Che Guevara, Eduardo Mondlane of Mozambique, and Amilcar Cabral of Guinea-Bissau. Soares asserts, "Poetry in this sense has the sense of revolution. Poetry has the power of revolution. Poetry has the power to rock the boat. Poetry is a revolutionary act."

This revolutionary spirit is evident in how Soares uses his poetry to preserve and revitalize Timorese cultural identity, especially during the years of Indonesian occupation. His work became a form of resistance, keeping alive the dream of Timorese independence and cultural autonomy even in the darkest times.

One of Soares' poetic inspirations is Francisco Borja da Costa, a Timorese poet killed during the Indonesian invasion in 1975. Soares particularly admires the fifth stanza of Borja da Costa's poem "The Maubere people should not be slaves any more," which speaks of creating "a new person" from "this trampled soil." This idea of renewal and rebirth from oppression is a recurring theme in Soares' own work.

## The Three-Dimensional Poet

A unique aspect of Soares' poetic philosophy is his concept of the "three-dimensional poet." He believes that to create a brighter future, one must "take one step backward and two steps forward." This approach involves simultaneously engaging with the past, present, and future:

1. The Past: Learning from history and maintaining connections to cultural roots.
2. The Present: Engaging intensively with current realities and challenges.
3. The Future: Envisioning and working towards a better tomorrow.

This three-dimensional perspective is evident in much of Soares' work, including his poem "The Dreams of Crazy Poets" (2009):

```
The dreams of poets are carried on, and they extend their hands to each other
The dreams of poets bidu and tebe circling around Planet Earth with joy
The dreams of poets wake me up
As well as the crowd who are still soundly sleeping
```

Here, Soares connects traditional Timorese dances (bidu and tebe) with a global vision of poets joining hands around the planet. This poem encapsulates his ability to bridge past and future, local and global, in a single poetic image.

## Language as a Bridge

Soares' multilingual approach to poetry is both a reflection of Timor-Leste's linguistic diversity and a powerful tool for cultural expression and preservation. He writes in Tetum (which he calls "the language of my soul"), Indonesian, Portuguese, English, and several indigenous Timorese languages including Bunak and Galole.

This linguistic versatility allows Soares to reach diverse audiences and to express nuanced aspects of Timorese culture that may be unique to certain languages. He encourages other Timorese writers to embrace their linguistic heritage, stating, "So it doesn't matter what language a poet chooses to write, it is about the inner voice, the voice of the crocodile."

Soares sees his role as a "modern lia-na'in" - a keeper of words in the tradition of Timorese oral culture. This concept of lia-na'in traditionally refers to spiritual and visionary figures in Timorese society who preserve and transmit cultural knowledge. By adopting this role in a modern context, Soares bridges traditional and contemporary forms of cultural expression.

## Shaping the Tetum Language

Beyond his individual poetic expressions, Soares' work plays a significant role in the development of the Tetum language itself. As Tetum evolves into a more robust written language capable of expressing complex ideas, Soares and other poets are at the forefront of this linguistic development.

He draws parallels between the current evolution of Tetum and the development of Indonesian as a national language in the early 20th century, influenced by writers like Chairil Anwar and W.S. Rendra. Soares notes, "When you write poetry you create new expressions," highlighting the role of poets in expanding the expressive capabilities of Tetum.

This process of linguistic innovation through literature is crucial for the growth of Tetum as a national language. It allows for the expression of modern concepts while maintaining connections to traditional Timorese culture and ways of thinking.

## Exile and Return: A Poetic Journey

Soares' personal journey of exile and return is deeply reflected in his poetry. During his years in Canada, writing became a lifeline, a way to maintain his connection to Timor-Leste and to process the trauma of separation and loss. He describes poetry as "a therapy" that saved him from loneliness during this period.

His exile poetry often evokes the Timorese landscape and cultural symbols, serving as a form of imaginative resistance against the physical separation from his homeland. This theme is evident in poems like "I saw my own reflection," which uses the image of Mount Ramelau to connect with the essence of Timorese identity.

Upon returning to Timor-Leste after independence, Soares' poetry shifted to themes of reconciliation, nation-building, and the challenges of forging a new national identity. His poem "Flourish Everlasting," written in response to internal violence in Timor-Leste in 2006, exemplifies this new focus:

```
Everything will be crushed
Everything will be broken
Everything will become dusty
New buds will appear, the flat land flourishing
We will pray
We will sing the songs of ancestors
We will tebe
We will bidu
circling the stones of the sacred house
[...]
The happiness of love will appear
The beauty of peace will be green
Flourish and flourish
```

This poem uses the imagery of traditional dances and the sacred house to evoke a vision of reconciliation and renewal. It demonstrates Soares' belief in the power of cultural traditions to heal and unite the nation.

## Global Influences, Local Roots

While deeply rooted in Timorese culture, Soares' poetry also reflects a wide range of global influences. He cites inspiration from diverse sources, including the film "Dead Poets Society," Lebanese writer Kahlil Gibran, Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, and Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano.

This global perspective allows Soares to place Timorese experiences and struggles in a broader context, connecting them to universal themes of freedom, identity, and human dignity. At the same time, he remains committed to expressing these ideas through distinctly Timorese cultural forms and languages.

## The MSB Club: Nurturing New Voices

Soares' commitment to fostering a new generation of Timorese writers and artists is exemplified by his establishment of the MSB (Mind, Soul, Body) cultural study club in 2008. Inspired by "Dead Poets Society," this initiative aims to promote Timorese culture through various languages and art forms.

The MSB club represents Soares' vision of cultural development that is both rooted in tradition and open to innovation. It provides a space for young Timorese to engage with their cultural heritage while also exploring new forms of expression, embodying Soares' belief in the importance of bridging past and future.

## Radio and the Power of Spoken Word

Recognizing the importance of oral traditions in Timorese culture, Soares has been a strong advocate for poetry in spoken form. His long-running poetry show on radio RTL, which he recently resumed on Radio Liberdade Dili, brings poetry to a wide audience in a format that resonates with Timorese oral traditions.

Soares describes these broadcasts as "vibrant, alive because it is spoken," emphasizing the power of radio to reach people across Timor-Leste. This approach not only makes poetry more accessible but also helps to preserve and evolve the oral storytelling traditions that are central to Timorese culture.

## Poetry in Nation-Building

Throughout his career, Soares has emphasized the crucial role of poetry and culture in the process of nation-building. He argues that poets are the "soul-keepers of the nation," responsible for nurturing and expressing the national spirit. In his view, "If a nation loses its soul, that is the suicide of that nation."

This perspective places a significant responsibility on artists and writers in Timor-Leste. Soares sees their role as not just chronicling the nation's journey but actively shaping its identity and future. He advocates for the inclusion of poetry in school curricula, believing that it plays an important role in character development from an early age.

## Conclusion: The Enduring Flame of Poetry

Abé Barreto Soares' poetic message is one of resilience, cultural pride, and hope for the future. Through his multilingual, multi-faceted approach to poetry, he has created a body of work that serves as both a mirror and a beacon for the Timorese people. His poetry reflects the struggles and triumphs of Timor-Leste's past while also illuminating pathways to a brighter future.

Soares' emphasis on the "three-dimensional" nature of poetry - engaging with past, present, and future simultaneously - offers a powerful framework for understanding the role of culture in national development. By rooting his work deeply in Timorese soil while also reaching out to global influences, Soares demonstrates how poetry can serve as a bridge between tradition and modernity, between local identity and universal human experiences.

As Timor-Leste continues to develop as a nation, the poetic voice of Abé Barreto Soares remains a vital force in shaping its cultural landscape. His message of cultural preservation, linguistic diversity, and the revolutionary power of words continues to inspire new generations of Timorese writers and artists. In Soares' own words, his hope is that "poetry will continue to flourish, that the flame of poetry will continue to burn." Through his enduring legacy, that flame shows no signs of dimming.
