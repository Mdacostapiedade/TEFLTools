# Dawn in Dili

Morning light filters through banana leaves,
Dew glistens on my grandmother's frangipani.
I breathe in salt and plumeria,
The sea and sky merge on the horizon.

Gentle waves lap at my feet,
Sand crabs scuttle in intricate patterns.
My fingers trace their trails,
A map of life etched in sand.

Roosters crow in the distance,
Their voices blend with the rustling palms.
I tend to our papaya saplings,
Feeling life pulse through tender stems.

A gecko suns itself on a rock,
Its eyes meet mine in silent recognition.
We share this moment, this breath,
Both at home in the warmth of the sun.

Macaque monkeys chatter in the trees,
Their playful leaps make me smile.
I am the branch, I am the leap,
I am the laughter echoing through the forest.

The wind carries scents of clove and cinnamon,
Spices from the market down the road.
I inhale deeply, savoring each note,
The whole world contained in a breath.

As I walk back home, my footprints
Join countless others on the beach.
Each step a prayer, each touch a blessing,
The earth and I move as one.

In our garden, I pick ripe mangoes,
Juice drips down my chin, sweet and tangy.
I am the fruit, I am the tree,
I am the soil from which all springs.

Night falls, and fireflies dance,
Their light a mirror to the stars above.
I lie in the grass, gazing upward,
My heart beats with the rhythm of the cosmos.

In this moment, in this place,
There is no separation, no longing.
I am the land, I am the sea,
I am Timor, and Timor is me.
