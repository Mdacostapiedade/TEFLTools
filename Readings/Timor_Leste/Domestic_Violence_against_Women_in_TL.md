Title: The Impact of Bride-Price Traditions on Domestic Violence Against Women in Timor-Leste

Abstract:
This article examines the relationship between the cultural practice of bride-price (barlake) and the prevalence of domestic violence against women in Timor-Leste. Based on a comparative study conducted by Khan and Hyati (2012) in four districts of Timor-Leste, the article analyzes how bride-price traditions in patrilineal (kaben-sai) communities may contribute to higher rates of intimate partner violence compared to matrilineal (kaben-tama) communities. The findings suggest that while bride-price is not a direct cause of domestic violence, the transactional nature of barlake combined with patriarchal attitudes increases women's vulnerability in married-out clans. The article concludes with recommendations for community education, legal reforms, and further research to address this complex issue.

Introduction:
Domestic violence against women remains a pervasive problem in Timor-Leste. The 2009-2010 Demographic and Health Survey found that 36% of women had experienced intimate partner violence in the previous 12 months (NSD et al., 2010). Cultural attitudes and practices play a significant role in shaping societal responses to gender-based violence. One such custom is barlake (bride-price), which involves an exchange of gifts between the bride and groom's families upon marriage. In married-out (kaben-sai) traditions, the bride leaves her clan to join her husband's, and a substantial bride-price is paid. Married-in (kaben-tama) clans practice matrilocal residence, and bride-price is minimal or absent. To investigate the potential links between barlake and domestic violence, Khan and Hyati (2012) conducted a comparative study in four districts of Timor-Leste. This article examines their key findings and recommendations.

Methodology:
Khan and Hyati (2012) employed a qualitative approach, conducting interviews and focus group discussions with married women, community leaders, and police officers in eight sub-districts of Bobonaro, Covalima, Manufahi, and Manututo. The study compared women's experiences of domestic violence in 15 kaben-sai and 15 kaben-tama clans. Participants were asked about marriage customs, attitudes towards bride-price and domestic violence, help-seeking behaviors, and awareness of the Law Against Domestic Violence (LADV) enacted in 2010. 

Findings:

1. Domestic violence prevalence: Nine out of 15 women (60%) from married-out clans reported experiencing domestic violence, compared to four out of 15 (26%) in married-in clans.

2. Bride-price and women's status: Although not perceived as a direct trigger for abuse, barlake was linked to the commodification of women. Men paying high bride-prices often justified control over their wives as "ownership". Women felt pressured to remain in abusive marriages due to the bride-price debt.

3. Community attitudes: In both clan types, some level of domestic violence was considered normal and not worthy of outside intervention. Women were socialized to endure abuse and prioritize family unity. Help-seeking from parents or local leaders was only acceptable for severe physical violence.

4. Barriers to justice: Married-out women faced more constraints in accessing justice. Leaving an abusive husband meant the bride-price had to be repaid by her family. Some clans fined husbands for "releasing" wives who sought refuge. These practices discouraged reporting and enabled abusive men to act with impunity.

5. Impact of LADV: Despite the 2010 law making domestic violence a public crime, awareness remained low among women and customary leaders. Cases continued to be settled through traditional justice (adat) rather than referral to police. Married-out women felt more pressure to reconcile through local dispute resolution to avoid "shaming" their husbands.

Discussion:
The findings suggest that bride-price traditions can reinforce women's subordination and hinder their ability to resist domestic violence. The exchange of gifts creates an unequal power dynamic between wife-givers and wife-takers, positioning women as transactional objects rather than rights-bearing individuals (Hohe & Nixon, 2003). While barlake itself does not directly cause domestic violence, the sense of entitlement and ownership it fosters in husbands may lower inhibitions against marital abuse. This is exacerbated in a cultural context where women's submission is expected and male violence is normalized as "discipline" (Swaine, 2003).

The study highlights the complex interplay between formal and customary justice systems in Timor-Leste. Adat processes are valued for maintaining community harmony, but often privilege men's interests and pressure women to endure abuse (Khan & Hyati, 2012). Married-out women face additional barriers to reporting violence and seeking redress, due to bride-price repayment customs that penalize them for rejecting marriage. Lack of awareness and socialization of LADV means that most cases never reach the formal justice system, despite domestic violence now being a public crime. 

Notably, some kaben-sai clans have modified or rejected barlake practices to protect women from violence and abandonment. Manututo district, where bride-price is minimal, also has the lowest domestic violence prevalence rate in the country (NSD et al., 2010). This suggests that cultural norms around marriage are not immutable and can evolve to promote gender equality.
 
Conclusion:
This article highlights the complex relationship between bride-price traditions and domestic violence in Timor-Leste. While not directly causal, the commodification of women through barlake can reinforce patriarchal control and impede women's access to justice, particularly in married-out clans. Awareness-raising on women's rights, customary law reforms, and LADV socialization are all needed to combat domestic violence. Further research should examine how matrilineal traditions may be protective and identify culturally-grounded interventions to transform harmful masculinities. Ultimately, ending domestic violence will require a holistic approach that engages both traditional and state actors to ensure women's safety and empowerment.
