# José Ramos-Horta: A Voice for Global Justice and Peace

In the realm of international diplomacy and human rights advocacy, few voices resonate with the clarity, passion, and poetic eloquence of José Ramos-Horta. As the President of Timor-Leste and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Ramos-Horta has emerged as a powerful advocate for global justice, peace, and equitable development. His recent address at the 20th IISS Shangri-La Dialogue serves as a testament to his unwavering commitment to these ideals and offers a profound critique of the current state of global affairs.

## The Poet-Statesman: Ramos-Horta's Rhetorical Prowess

Ramos-Horta's oratory is marked by a unique blend of pragmatic analysis and poetic sensibility. His words paint vivid pictures of global inequities while simultaneously calling for action with the urgency of a prophet. In his speech, he begins with a striking declaration: "Our world is leaderless." This simple yet powerful statement sets the tone for a discourse that is both a lament for the current state of affairs and a rallying cry for change.

The poetic quality of Ramos-Horta's rhetoric is evident in his use of metaphor and imagery. He speaks of the world's wealth increasing "by $30 trillion" annually, juxtaposing this astronomical figure against the stark reality that "hundreds of millions of our fellow human beings in the global south do not have access to clean water, nature's treasure that is fast becoming a scarcity." This contrast between abundance and scarcity, wealth and poverty, is a recurring theme in his address, serving to underscore the moral imperative for change.

Ramos-Horta's linguistic artistry is further exemplified in his description of global inequality: "We share the same planet but we live in different global villages. Most survive in slums; a few live in Alice in Wonderland palatial homes." This vivid imagery not only highlights the vast disparities in living conditions across the globe but also invokes a sense of surrealism, suggesting that the extreme wealth of a few is as detached from reality as the fantastical world of Alice in Wonderland.

## A Call for Global Justice

At the heart of Ramos-Horta's message is a passionate plea for global justice. He critiques the current international order, where "multilateral institutions are weakened, sidelined by super powers." His words carry a sense of urgency, highlighting the failure of those who "claim entitlement to a place of honour in the UN Security Council, G7 and G20" to show the necessary wisdom and leadership in addressing global crises.

Ramos-Horta's call for justice extends beyond mere rhetoric. He proposes concrete actions, such as debt forgiveness for impoverished nations and a significant increase in official development assistance (ODA). His suggestion that "every Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) country should allocate 1.0% of its national GDP towards ODA" is not just a policy recommendation but a moral imperative, framed within the context of building "a fair and a peaceful wall, a wall without extreme poverty and conflict."

The poetic quality of his advocacy is evident in his use of contrasts and parallels. He juxtaposes the "hundreds of billions of dollars to rescue exposed European banks" against the lack of similar mobilization to assist developing countries. This stark comparison serves to highlight the inequities in global financial responses and underscores the need for a more balanced and just approach to international aid and development.

## The Voice of the Global South

Ramos-Horta positions himself as a voice for the often-unheard Global South. His rhetoric is imbued with empathy for the struggles of developing nations, drawing from his own experiences and those of his country, Timor-Leste. He shares an anecdote about a conversation with a Somali diplomat, using this personal story to illustrate the changing dynamics of global power and the appeal of China to nations feeling abandoned by the West.

The poetic resonance of this narrative is striking. Ramos-Horta quotes the Somali diplomat: "In the past when the Europeans and Americans lectured us on human rights and refused to help, we just turned to Moscow. Now, we are alone; nowhere to go; no one is helping us." This simple statement encapsulates decades of geopolitical shifts and the sense of abandonment felt by many in the Global South. Ramos-Horta then fast-forwards to the present, imagining the same diplomat saying, "We are no longer alone. Now, we go to China." This narrative arc, spanning decades and geopolitical realignments, is delivered with the economy and impact of a poetic verse.

## A Vision for Peace and Cooperation

While Ramos-Horta's speech is critical of current global dynamics, it is also infused with hope and a vision for a more cooperative future. He calls for the South China Sea to be declared "a zone of peace and cooperation," advocating for adherence to international law and de-escalation of military tensions. His approach to complex issues like the situation in the Korean Peninsula is nuanced, recognizing the realities of nuclear proliferation while still pushing for dialogue and cooperation.

The poetic quality of Ramos-Horta's vision is perhaps most evident in his description of Timor-Leste as "a twinkling light of peace and fraternity." This metaphor not only paints a vivid picture of his nation but also serves as an inspirational model for what can be achieved through dialogue, reconciliation, and democratic governance.

## Historical Significance: From Freedom Fighter to Global Statesman

While the focus of Ramos-Horta's speech is on present challenges and future aspirations, it's impossible to fully appreciate his message without acknowledging his historical significance. Ramos-Horta's journey from a freedom fighter advocating for Timor-Leste's independence to a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and president of his nation lends weight and credibility to his words.

His experiences in the struggle for independence and in nation-building inform his perspective on global affairs. When he speaks of the challenges of "ending conflict, restoring peace, reconciling divided communities, uniting the nation and governing peacefully," he does so not as a theoretical observer but as someone who has lived through these processes.

Ramos-Horta's historical significance is also evident in his approach to reconciliation and forgiveness. He acknowledges that "for the victimised families and communities with deep scars in their body and heart, the words reconciliation and forgiveness can be offensive." Yet, he advocates for this difficult path, drawing from his own experiences in Timor-Leste's journey towards peace and stability.

## The Power of Words: Ramos-Horta's Linguistic Legacy

Throughout his address, Ramos-Horta demonstrates a masterful command of language, using it not just to convey information but to evoke emotion and inspire action. His speech is peppered with memorable phrases and poetic constructions that linger in the mind long after they're spoken.

Consider his description of global challenges: "Hard power tools available to the mightily rich of the world are not lawfully applied because the powers that could make a difference between war and peace are too busy squandering resources in narrow, selfish rivalries, each bent on regional influence and supremacy." This sentence is a tour de force of rhetoric, combining alliteration ("mightily," "make"), metaphor ("hard power tools"), and a scathing critique of global power dynamics.

Ramos-Horta's linguistic prowess is also evident in his ability to distill complex ideas into pithy, memorable statements. "If the global south is not supported in meaningful ways to recover their livelihoods, no walls will be thick enough and high enough to prevent millions of destitute and desperate from continuing to flock to the privileged north." This sentence encapsulates an entire argument about global inequality, migration, and the interconnectedness of our world in a single, powerful image.

## A Call to Action: The Urgency of Now

Perhaps the most striking aspect of Ramos-Horta's address is its sense of urgency. He presents the challenges facing our world not as abstract problems for future generations but as pressing issues demanding immediate action. This urgency is reflected in his language, which often takes on the cadence of a call to arms.

"The billionaires and trillionaires of the south and the north should do their part to share their mammoth fortunes with the less fortunate of our common humanity," he declares, his words a clarion call for global solidarity and action. The use of "mammoth fortunes" creates a vivid image of the vast wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, while "our common humanity" reminds us of our shared responsibility and interconnectedness.

Ramos-Horta's call to action extends beyond individuals to nations and international bodies. He challenges the global north to "regain the trust of the global south" through "wiser and more honest and determined strategy to support the hundreds of millions who, for decades, humble queue up for Western aid." The image of millions humbly queuing for aid is both poignant and convicting, a powerful reminder of the human cost of global inequality.

## Conclusion: The Enduring Power of Ramos-Horta's Voice

José Ramos-Horta's address at the 20th IISS Shangri-La Dialogue is more than a speech; it is a poetic manifesto for a more just and peaceful world. Through his masterful use of language, vivid imagery, and personal anecdotes, Ramos-Horta paints a picture of our global challenges that is at once sobering and inspiring.

His words serve as a reminder of the power of eloquence in shaping global discourse. In an era often characterized by sound bites and Twitter diplomacy, Ramos-Horta's thoughtful, nuanced, and poetic approach to global issues stands out. He demonstrates that it is possible to be both a pragmatic statesman and a visionary poet, using the power of language to bridge divides and inspire action.

As we grapple with the complex challenges of the 21st century, voices like Ramos-Horta's are more crucial than ever. His unique blend of historical perspective, moral clarity, and poetic expression offers a template for how we might approach global issues with both wisdom and compassion. In the end, Ramos-Horta's greatest contribution may be his reminder that in the face of daunting global challenges, our most powerful tools are not weapons or wealth, but words used in service of our common humanity.
