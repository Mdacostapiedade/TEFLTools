Lali'an Versus Improved Cook Stoves: How Change Happens in Urban Households in Timor-Leste
Most households in Timor-Leste use lali'an, a traditional open fire method of cooking that has considerable environmental, health, and social impacts. Many of these impacts can be mitigated using simple, low-cost, and more fuel-efficient improved cook stoves (ICSs). Drawing on qualitative data from householders, key informants, and the researcher's observations, this article explores women's experiences of using ICS in Timor-Leste. It outlines the economic and time cost for households using lali'an, and the health, social, and economic benefits of ICSs.
Using the information–motivation–behavioral skills model, this study explores the dynamics of the decision-making process and behavior change related to cooking technology. The findings show that women are primarily responsible for the household kitchen; however, they are not always in a position to make the decision to adopt an ICS. It is therefore imperative that the introduction and promotion of ICS to households in Timor-Leste be accessible to women, as investment and awareness-raising regarding ICS will contribute much to the satisfaction of women's basic needs, children's health, and reduction of deforestation in Timor-Leste.

Introduction
The impact of the devastating exploitation of the world's forest and other natural resources over recent decades has been intensified by the dependence of 50 percent of the world's population (and up to 95 percent of the population of low-income countries) on wood, dung, agriculture residues, and coal for their energy needs (Duflo, Greenstone, and Hanna 2008). This dependency also has negative economic and social impact. Of particular concern is the negative impact of the use of conventional open fire or lali'an on the environment, and on users' health. Traditional lali'an, also known as three-stone stoves (3SS), are essentially a wood-fueled open fire with three stones or iron legs for cooking. Wood smoke from these stoves is particularly dangerous to the normal development of infants and children and is a contributor to lower respiratory infections in children such as bronchitis and pneumonia (Bryce et al. 2005).
Several developing countries are turning to clean energy and innovative technologies to help reduce the consumption of natural resources and to minimize emissions and improve health. One of the simplest ways of doing this is through the introduction of improved cook stoves (ICSs), which are "designed to improve energy efficiency, remove smoke from indoor living space, or lessen the drudgery of cooking duties" (World Bank 2011:3). There is a range of ICS models and types globally. In Timor-Leste the "improved cook stove" refers to stoves that are made of cement or clay. They usually have a small hole to feed the firewood and outlet for the ash (see Figure 1). The ICSs used in Timor-Leste are a type of cook stoves designed with a clay chamber located at the center of the stove, and an outside cover made of cement or tin. The function of the clay chamber is to ensure that the heat of the stove lasts, and to reduce the consumption of firewood. In some districts of Timor-Leste, these pottery cook stoves have been produced for several decades, and there are now new initiatives to promote the ICS by Mercy Corps, and other local nongovernment organizations (NGOs) as part of effective energy programs. However, at the time of writing very few people are using these new, and often locally made, cook stoves.
This article draws on results from research carried out in Dili and Baucau, Timor-Leste (see also Nguyen 2017), supported by a research fellowship from the Asia Foundation's Policy Leader Group initiative. The research explored the socioeconomic benefits of households using ICSs, and the process of change from traditional to ICSs. The focus of this article is how to create changes for women who are using improved firewood stoves. Other alternative energy cook stoves, such as biogas and solar stoves, are occasionally used in Timor-Leste but were not the focus of this research. The researcher focused on biomass ICSs as these are an easier choice for households accustomed to using lali'an, with simple techniques to get the fire started as long as the wood fuel is dry enough. This type of stove is also more available and affordable than other types of cook stoves, which tend to be beyond the reach of most people in the study areas.
This article emphasizes socioeconomic benefits of improved cooking stoves to women's lives in urban and rural areas, the economic and time cost for households using lali'an and the health, social, and economic impact on women and children in households that use the ICS. At present, there is limited research on indoor air pollution and stove use in Timor-Leste, and there is little evidence-based research on households using ICS. As such, this research provides important information and knowledge for policy makers, educators, and other development agencies seeking to minimize the negative impact of energy use on the environment and to lessen extraction of the forestry resources.
The Impacts of Lali'an
In rural areas, the sight and smell of wood smoke evokes unforgettable memories of childhood. People who grew up in the villages may keep in their hearts and minds the peaceful image of rising smoke from simple homes made of coconut or palm leaves. Many songs and poems from the country capture this image. Most of the population of Timor-Leste still use these lali'an and it is part of their ritual center in their uma lulik (sacred house). Many tribes and ethnic groups in Timor-Leste use lali'an to cook foods and to offer meals to their ancestors, and it was placed at the center of the traditional house together with other cooking items (Nguyen 2017). Traditional lali'an play a particularly important part in the lives of ordinary farmers: in addition to cooking, the heat from the fire can keep them warm during the cold season and the smoke from the lali'an is used to protect the agricultural seeds from moss and insects. However, cooking is the main purpose of the traditional lali'an.
The widespread use of lali'an is reflected in the particularly high use of biomass for fuel in Timor-Leste. Arcenas et al. (2010) found that 98 percent of households in Timor-Leste use firewood or straw as their main cooking fuel, while the National Statistics Directorate and the United Nations Population Fund (NSD and UNFPA 2010) found that 89.6 percent of households in Timor-Leste still use wood as the main source of energy for cooking. Most of these households use lali'an. In 2011, a survey on energy use by Mercy Corps showed that reliance on these open fires for cooking is almost 100 percent in some regions, and around 91 percent in Dili. However, the beauty of the traditional village scene masks myriad environmental, economic, social, and health impacts.
Environmental Impacts
The environmental impact of the use of lali'an is significant, although only recently has the development community turned its attention to the implications of household energy for climate change and recognized that unsustainable levels of biomass harvesting put considerable pressure on biomass resources (World Bank 2011). The World Bank (2011) reports that about 730 million tons of biomass is burned every year, a staggering amount contributing more than 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere globally. In particular, the use of lali'an contributes to increasing black carbon emissions that can worsen global climate change and consequently endanger our ecological system (Bensch and Peter 2012; Bond et al. 2004; Ramanathan and Carmichael 2008).
Harvesting biomass for cooking also contributes to deforestation of many regions. Deforestation is a major concern globally as it is linked to environmental and climate change, and was implicated in the prolonged dry season in Timor-Leste in 2015, which resulted in the loss of harvests and the death of animals (see Fridolf 2016). This form of environmental degradation is often overlooked by authorities and development organizations but the harvesting of fuel wood for cooking can significantly deplete natural resources and have long-term consequences for biodiversity (Specht et al. 2015). Deforestation is a particular problem in Timor-Leste. Indeed, around Dili it is estimated that about 110 km2 has been deforested (Accenture Development Partnerships 2011). Although this is not entirely attributable to fuel-wood collection, the rate of deforestation is a concern, particularly as Timor-Leste has one of the highest annual population growth rates in the world, which is leading to increased pressure on natural resources (Hosgelen and Saikia 2016).
Although it is beyond the scope of this study to quantify the environmental cost to Timor-Leste, it is possible to make some basic calculations that highlight the extent of the loss using 2010 census data, and data from a Mercy Corps survey (2011). The Mercy Corps survey showed that households use an average of 9.3 kg of firewood every day (3.4 tons per year). There are 184,652 households in Timor-Leste, with 89.6 percent of households still using wood as their main energy source for cooking (NSD and UNFPA 2010). This equates to about 565,035 tons of wood consumed per year. This does not include other users of fuel wood, for example, many restaurants in Dili and Baucau also collect or buy firewood from outside town to cook meat and fish, increasing the demand on firewood in rural areas near the cities. While individual stove users may not be aware of the wider consequences of deforestation, this demand has significant consequences on their daily lives, with 55 percent of households surveyed by Mercy Corps finding it harder to collect firewood than it was 5 years earlier. Indeed, Mercy Corps used local perceptions of the changes in the ease of firewood collection over time as a proxy for changes in accessible forest (and therefore deforestation).
Economic and Social Impacts
While the environmental cost of traditional stoves may not be clear to individual stove users, the economic costs are a significant concern; although the use of wood fuels for cooking may appear to be low cost, there are significant economic impacts in terms of labor and/or the purchase of firewood. Many urban households in Timor-Leste need to buy wood, which can get expensive. The mean weekly expenditure for food for households participating in this research was USD 13.60. The mean amount spent on firewood for an open fire (3SS) was USD 8.70. For households using an open fire to cook the cost of firewood is equivalent to 57 percent of the weekly food expenses.
The use of traditional stoves also places a particularly high burden on women and children who are usually responsible for collecting the fuel wood and doing the cooking. While there is limited research on the environmental and social impacts of lali'an use in Timor-Leste, this research has provided some insights.
Health Impacts
While wood smoke may be reminiscent of peaceful village life for many Timorese people, it is a lethal killer. Residential wood combustion is now recognized as a major particle source in many developed countries. In research carried out in South-Western Nigeria, Oguntoke, Adebulehin, and Annegarn (2013) concluded that the concentration of CO, NO2, and H2S in the indoor environment of the selected houses was over the WHO permissible limits for human exposure. Warwick and Doig (2006) noted that women who spend more than 3 hours a day cooking using open fireplaces, are four times more likely to suffer from chronic pulmonary conditions and other respiratory diseases than women who are not exposed to indoor pollution.
Children are particularly at risk from wood smoke. Warwick and Doig (2006) found that children exposed to indoor air pollution are more likely to develop pneumonia, while a study by Browning et al. (1990) found that wood smoke air pollution aggravated symptoms of respiratory disease in preschool children. As such, residential wood combustion is now recognized as a major source of dangerous airborne particles in many developing countries, and the number of studies investigating the negative health effects associated with wood smoke exposure is increasing (Bølling et al. 2009).
Health problems resulting from exposure to wood smoke are a significant public health concern in Timor-Leste. Data from the annual report of the Ministry of Health (Gabinet de Director Geral 2013) showed that acute upper respiratory infection is one of the top ten diseases in Timor-Leste, while pneumonia ranked third among the top ten illnesses in 2012 and 2013. Arcenas et al. (2010) estimate the annual morbidity and mortality cost of health effects from indoor air pollution associated with wood-burning stoves in Timor-Leste at $12.5 million, equivalent to about 1.4 percent of Timor-Leste gross national income in 2006. Unfortunately, these data are not disaggregated by gender, but it is not unreasonable to assume, given women's primary role in cooking, that women are disproportionately represented in these statistics.
The Uptake of New Technologies
A key focus of this study was to explore and explain behavior change in relation to the uptake of ICSs. In collecting and analyzing the data on decision-making, this article draws on theories of decision-making and the information-motivation-behavioral (IMB) skills model. Introduced by Fisher and Fisher in 1992 and used extensively in health behavior research (see, e.g., Ritterband et al. 2009; Talley, Yang, and Williams 2016), the IMB model is composed of three pillars: information—the knowledge needed to support behavior change; motivation, which refers to attitudes towards behavior change; and behavior, which refers to the skills acquired that are necessary to maintain the behavior change (Fisher and Fisher 1992).
The IMB model helps explain how behavior change occurs in those who adopt new behaviors, technologies, and practices, and why others are not yet ready to make the decision. According to the model, information and motivation are thought to activate behavioral skills that result in the initiation and maintenance of change (Fisher et al. 1994). The effects of information on change and motivation to change are expressed mainly as a result of the development and deployment of behavioral skills. As such, Fisher and Fisher (2002) argue that the likelihood of individuals initiating and maintaining change is closely related to the extent they are well informed, motivated to act, and possess the behavioral skills required to act effectively.
Using the IMB also aids in understanding the decision-making process around ICSs as it can help identify the obstacles in the decision-making process and therefore the uptake of the new stoves. Women in particular often lack knowledge about technology, and as a result may not be motivated to take up the advantages that technology may offer them (Jeuland et al. 2015; van der Kroon, Brouwer, and van Beukering 2014). Women are often very practical in adopting new methods, learning and using what is present and available to them. It is therefore reasonable to assume that if new cooking technologies are available and can be provided at a reasonable cost, women will try them. Although there has been little research to date on decision-making regarding cook stove choice in Timor-Leste, several factors have been identified in other studies. These include the cost of the stove, social norms, market access, fuel availability, and the presence and strength of technology-promoting organizations (Bhojvaid et al. 2014; Jeuland et al. 2015; Pine et al. 2011). Kukita (2013) noted some conditions that contribute to the decision-making process in Timorese households, with a key factor being the dynamics of the household and its members, including gender relations and economic factors. Therefore, it is important to assess the preference and needs of each household member and the dynamics within the household in understanding the decision-making.
These studies are reflected in a review of the research on improved solid fuel stoves by Rehfuess et al. (2014), which showed that factors influencing behavior change in the adaption of new technologies are the perceived complexity of new stoves, social support for adoption of the new stoves, and knowledge about use and maintenance of improved stoves. There are also enabling factors such as subsidies for the stove producers, free distribution, systems of follow-up, and support. Other factors that can be enablers or restrainers in the uptake of new technology are the characteristics of the households and the demographic profile of respondents (Rehfuess et al. 2014).
Methodology
This research used a qualitative approach drawing on ethnographic methods including interviews and participant observation. The participants in the research included 22 householders, Baucau (10 informants) and Dili (12 informants), who are using ICSs, and 5 householders (3 from Baucau and 2 from Dili) using lali'an (open fireplaces), as well as a range of key informants. Respondents were selected using "snowball" and "purposive" sampling. Various agencies and households in the different communities were chosen through friend networks as well as via a recommendation letter from the Asia Foundation that helped the researcher in her approach to NGOs (Haburas), one cook stove producer and seller from Baucau, the Secretary of State on Environment, and the Head of the Department of Environmental Health. These organizations and individuals were purposively included in the research for their role in promoting the use of ICS. At
