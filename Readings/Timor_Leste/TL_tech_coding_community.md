# PyLadies Dili: Empowering Women in Tech in Timor-Leste

## Introduction

PyLadies Dili is a potential chapter of the global PyLadies organization, which aims to promote, educate, and advance a diverse Python community with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. While there isn't currently an established PyLadies chapter in Dili, Timor-Leste, this resource will explore the potential for starting one and how it could benefit the local tech community.

## Why Start a PyLadies Chapter in Dili?
