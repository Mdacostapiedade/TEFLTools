Here is the story focusing more on the traditional tale of the crocodile:

Mau Lear settled himself under the sprawling banyan tree, his knobby hands resting on his knees. The village children gathered around him, their eyes wide with anticipation. It was time for a story, and today Mau Lear would tell the tale of how Timor came to be - the legend of the crocodile prince.

"In a kingdom beneath the sea, there lived a curious young prince who longed to see the world above the waves," Mau Lear began, his voice soft but captivating. "One day, as he explored the ocean depths, he came upon a crocodile thrashing in pain, a fisherman's hook lodged in its mouth."

The children leaned forward, already enthralled. Mau Lear continued, "The compassionate prince carefully removed the hook, and the grateful crocodile offered to take him on a journey to the world above. The prince climbed upon the crocodile's back, and together they swam up, up, up, until they broke through the shimmering surface."

Mau Lear's voice rose and fell, painting a vivid picture. "The prince marveled at the sight of the vast blue sky, the lush green mountains, and the golden sandy beaches. They explored the land, the crocodile carrying the prince safely on its back. But soon, the crocodile grew tired and hungry."

The children held their breath, waiting to hear what happened next. Mau Lear's eyes twinkled as he went on, "The kind prince, seeing his friend's weariness, said, 'Dear crocodile, you have shown me so much beauty and wonder. Let me repay your generosity. Lay down your head and rest.' The crocodile agreed and stretched out under the warm sun. The prince began to stroke its scaly head, singing a soothing lullaby."

Mau Lear's husky voice rose in the traditional melody, and the children joined in, the ancient words flowing easily from their young lips. As the lullaby ended, Mau Lear spoke softly, "As the crocodile slept, a wondrous transformation took place. Its body grew and grew, its scales turning into mountains and valleys, its spines into ridges and peaks. When the crocodile finally awoke, it had become an island - the island of Timor, a place for the prince to make his new home."

The children sat in awed silence, absorbing the story. Mau Lear smiled, his weathered face creasing. "And so, my young ones, that is how our beloved Timor came to be. The crocodile's generous spirit lives on in our land and in our people. We must always remember the lessons of kindness, friendship, and sacrifice that this story teaches us."

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Mau Lear sent the children home with these words of wisdom. He knew that through the power of storytelling, the traditions and values of their ancestors would endure, passed down from generation to generation, just as he was doing now. These oral traditions were the lifeblood of their community, and Mau Lear took great pride in his role as their guardian and gatekeeper.
