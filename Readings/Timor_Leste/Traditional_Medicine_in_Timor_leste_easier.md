Traditional Medicine Use in Timor-Leste: A Research Study

Background

Timor-Leste is a small Southeast Asian country that gained independence in 2002 after a long period of conflict. As a developing nation, Timor-Leste faces many challenges in providing healthcare to its population. The country spends less on healthcare as a percentage of GDP than any other nation. Although the government promotes free public healthcare, there are significant barriers to accessing medical services, especially in rural areas.

Traditional medicine has played an important role in Timorese culture and healthcare for generations. During the resistance against Indonesian occupation, knowledge of medicinal plants was crucial for fighters hiding in remote forest areas. After independence, as the formal healthcare system was rebuilding, traditional medicine saw a resurgence to fill gaps in medical care.

While modern health services have been slowly improving in Timor-Leste, traditional medicine remains widely used. However, there has been little research on the prevalence and patterns of traditional medicine use in the country. This study aimed to investigate these aspects and explore factors associated with traditional medicine use in contemporary Timor-Leste.

Methods

The researchers conducted structured interviews with 200 people at Hospital Nacional Guido Valadares, the main referral hospital in Timor-Leste. The participants included:

- 50 surgical patients
- 50 internal medicine patients  
- 50 hospital staff members
- 50 hospital visitors

The interviews were conducted in Tetun, the local language, by Timorese medical officers. The questionnaire included both closed and open-ended questions about participants' use of traditional medicine, including:

- If they had ever used traditional medicine
- How often they used it
- If they had used it in the past year
- The cost, preparation, and form of traditional medicine used
- Perceived effectiveness and reasons for use
- Demographic information like education level and place of residence

Traditional medicine was defined according to World Health Organization guidelines as practices based on indigenous Timorese cultural beliefs and experiences.

Results

Key findings from the study included:

1. Prevalence of use:
- 60% of participants reported having used traditional medicine at some point
- 32% had used it within the past year
- Surgical patients had the highest rate of use at 70%

2. Frequency of use:
- Of those who used traditional medicine, over half had used it more than 10 times
- Over half had used it within the past year

3. Demographics:
- Men were more likely than women to use traditional medicine
- Interestingly, there was no significant difference in usage rates based on:
  • Education level 
  • Community size (village, town, or city)
  • Residence in or outside the capital city of Dili

4. Types of traditional medicine:
- The most common form was herbal teas made from leaves, fruits, or roots
- Leaves and bark were sometimes applied directly to wounds
- Massage was also reported as a traditional treatment

5. Reasons for use:
- 45% used it as a pain reliever
- Many used it to treat chronic conditions like diabetes, respiratory diseases, and heart/kidney problems
- Common reasons cited included: low cost, belief it had no side effects, distance from hospitals, recommendations from family/friends

6. Preparation and cost:
- Most people prepared remedies themselves or had family/friends prepare them
- Only 15% reported getting medicines from a traditional healer
- Over 60% said traditional medicine was free
- When there was a cost, it was usually less than $10 USD

7. Perceived effectiveness:
- 49% said traditional medicine made them feel better
- 26% were unsure of its effects
- 25% said it did not help

Discussion

The study reveals that traditional medicine use is very common in Timor-Leste, with similar usage rates across different demographics. This contrasts with findings in some other countries where factors like education level or urban/rural residence significantly impact traditional medicine use.

The researchers suggest that the consistent use of traditional medicine across demographics may be due to strong cultural and family ties in Timor-Leste. Even as people move to urban areas, they maintain connections to their rural origins and traditional practices. The use of traditional medicine appears to be part of shared social and cultural norms.

The widespread knowledge of traditional remedies in Timor-Leste is notable. Unlike some cultures where this knowledge is held mainly by specialist healers, in Timor-Leste, many people prepare their own medicines. This keeps costs low and makes traditional medicine easily accessible.

The belief that traditional medicine has no side effects likely contributes to its popularity. However, this belief could potentially be dangerous if it leads people to delay seeking conventional medical care for serious conditions.

The study found that many patients use traditional medicine alongside conventional treatments, especially for chronic conditions. This highlights the need for healthcare providers to be aware of and ask about traditional medicine use to avoid potential interactions or complications.

Limitations and Further Research

The researchers note some limitations of the study:

1. It was conducted only at the main referral hospital, so may not fully represent patterns across all of Timor-Leste.

2. The use of medical officers to conduct interviews may have led some participants to underreport their traditional medicine use.

3. The study did not capture data on whether using traditional medicine caused delays in seeking conventional medical care.

They suggest that future research could:

- Sample participants from different locations throughout the country
- Use non-medical personnel to conduct interviews
- Investigate potential delays in seeking conventional care due to traditional medicine use
- Collect more detailed information on participants' income levels

Conclusion

Traditional medicine use is very common in Timor-Leste, spanning all levels of education and both rural and urban areas. It appears to be deeply ingrained in Timorese culture and social norms. Many people use traditional remedies alongside conventional medicine, especially for chronic conditions.

The researchers emphasize that healthcare providers in Timor-Leste need to be aware of how frequently patients may be using traditional medicine. They should be prepared to discuss traditional remedies with patients and consider potential interactions with conventional treatments.

This study provides valuable baseline data on traditional medicine use in Timor-Leste. Further research can build on these findings to develop healthcare policies and practices that effectively integrate traditional and conventional medicine, respecting cultural traditions while ensuring patient safety and optimal health outcomes.
