## Popular Timorese Folk Tales

### 1. The Legend of Crocodile Island

Long ago, in the vast expanse of the Timor Sea, there lived an ancient crocodile. This crocodile had seen countless moons rise and fall, and its scales were weathered by the passage of time. Despite its fearsome appearance, the old crocodile was lonely and yearned for companionship.

One day, as the crocodile basked on a sandbar, a young boy from a nearby village approached the water's edge. The boy, curious and unafraid, called out to the crocodile. "Great creature of the sea, why do you look so sad?"

The crocodile, surprised by the boy's bravery, replied, "I am old and alone, young one. I have no friends in this vast ocean."

The boy's heart filled with compassion. "I will be your friend," he declared. "I will visit you every day and keep you company."

True to his word, the boy returned each day, bringing stories from the village and laughter to the crocodile's life. As time passed, their friendship deepened, and the crocodile's loneliness faded away.

One day, the boy shared his dream of exploring distant lands across the sea. The crocodile, grateful for the boy's friendship, offered to take him on a journey. "Climb onto my back," the crocodile said, "and I will carry you across the waters to new shores."

Excited by the prospect of adventure, the boy agreed. They set off on their voyage, the boy perched atop the crocodile's broad back as they navigated through the rolling waves.

Days turned into weeks as they traveled, discovering new islands and marveling at the wonders of the ocean. The boy's joy was infectious, and the crocodile felt a sense of purpose it had never known before.

However, as their journey neared its end, a troubling thought crept into the crocodile's mind. It realized that once they returned home, the boy might no longer need its companionship. Fear and jealousy began to cloud the crocodile's judgment.

As they approached familiar waters, the crocodile spoke, its voice tinged with doubt. "My young friend, our journey is almost over. Tell me, what will you do when we return?"

The boy, oblivious to the crocodile's inner turmoil, replied enthusiastically, "I can't wait to share our adventures with my family and friends! And of course, I'll continue to visit you every day, just as before."

But the crocodile, blinded by its insecurities, misinterpreted the boy's words. It convinced itself that the boy would abandon their friendship once he was back on land. In a moment of betrayal, the crocodile decided to open its powerful jaws and swallow the boy whole.

Just as it was about to act on this terrible impulse, the boy reached down and patted the crocodile's head affectionately. "Thank you, my dear friend," he said warmly. "This journey has been the greatest gift. I'm so grateful for your friendship."

The crocodile, struck by the boy's sincerity and gratitude, was immediately filled with shame. It realized the depth of its mistake and the true value of their friendship. Overcome with remorse, the crocodile began to weep.

As its tears fell into the sea, a miraculous transformation began to take place. The crocodile's body began to grow and change, its scales becoming mountains, its limbs forming peninsulas, and its long tail creating the eastern part of the island.

The boy, astonished, found himself standing on newly formed land. He watched in awe as his friend transformed into the very island that would become known as Timor.

From that day forward, the island of Timor stood as a reminder of the power of friendship and the consequences of betrayal. The boy and his descendants became the first inhabitants of the island, always remembering the crocodile's sacrifice and the importance of gratitude.

To this day, the people of Timor-Leste honor the crocodile as their ancestor, recognizing the shape of the island as the body of the great reptile that befriended a boy long ago. This legend teaches the importance of loyalty, the danger of jealousy, and the transformative power of friendship.

### 2. The Tale of Rai Nain

In the lush, verdant hills of Timor-Leste, where mist clings to the mountaintops and ancient trees whisper secrets of the past, there lived a people deeply connected to the land. They understood that the earth beneath their feet was more than mere soil – it was alive with spirits known as the Rai Nain, the guardians of the land.

The Rai Nain were not visible to ordinary eyes, but their presence was felt in every rustling leaf, every bubbling spring, and every fertile field. They were the protectors of nature, ensuring balance and harmony in the world.

In a small village nestled in a valley, there lived a young woman named Bui. She had grown up hearing stories of the Rai Nain from her grandmother, who taught her the old ways and the importance of respecting the spirits of the land.

One year, as the dry season stretched on longer than usual, the village began to suffer. Crops withered in the fields, streams ran dry, and the once-lush forest became parched and lifeless. The villagers, desperate for relief, began to argue among themselves about what to do.

Some suggested clearing more forest to plant additional crops, while others wanted to divert water from a sacred spring. Bui listened to these debates with a heavy heart, remembering her grandmother's teachings about the delicate balance of nature.

One night, as Bui lay awake worrying about the future of her village, she heard a soft whisper carried on the wind. "Come," it seemed to say, "come to the ancient banyan tree at the edge of the forest."

Guided by instinct and the memory of her grandmother's stories, Bui slipped out of her home and made her way through the moonlit night to the massive banyan tree that had stood for generations.

As she approached, the air around her seemed to shimmer, and she felt a presence that was both ancient and alive. From the twisted roots and hanging vines of the banyan, a figure emerged – not quite solid, yet undeniably real. It was a Rai Nain, a guardian spirit of the land.

The Rai Nain spoke, its voice like the rustle of leaves and the flow of water. "Child of the earth, you have not forgotten us. While others seek to take from the land without giving in return, you remember the old ways."

Bui, awed but unafraid, bowed her head in respect. "Great Rai Nain," she said, "our village suffers. The rains have not come, and the people grow desperate. What can we do to restore balance?"

The spirit's eyes, deep as mountain pools, gazed at Bui. "The balance has been disrupted because the people have forgotten to give thanks and make offerings. They take from the land but do not nurture it in return. To restore harmony, you must remind them of the sacred covenant between humans and the earth."

The Rai Nain instructed Bui to gather the villagers and perform a ceremony of gratitude. They were to offer the first fruits of their harvest, no matter how meager, to the spirits of the land. More importantly, they were to pledge to care for the forest, protect the sacred springs, and farm in harmony with nature.

Bui returned to the village and, with passion and conviction, shared her encounter with the Rai Nain. Some skeptics scoffed at first, but many remembered the old stories and felt the truth of her words.

The next day, the entire village gathered at the foot of the ancient banyan tree. They brought offerings of fruit, rice, and flowers. The elders led prayers of gratitude, asking forgiveness for their neglect and renewing their commitment to the land.

As the ceremony reached its peak, a cool breeze began to blow, carrying with it the scent of rain. Dark clouds gathered on the horizon, and soon, life-giving rain began to fall, soaking the parched earth.

The villagers rejoiced, dancing in the rain and giving thanks to the Rai Nain. From that day forward, they were careful to maintain their relationship with the land. They protected the forests, kept the springs clean, and always remembered to give thanks for the bounty they received.

Bui became a respected leader in her community, teaching future generations about the importance of living in harmony with nature and respecting the Rai Nain. The village prospered, its fields fertile and its forests lush, all under the watchful care of the guardian spirits of the land.

This tale of the Rai Nain continues to be told in Timor-Leste, reminding people of their sacred connection to the earth and the importance of maintaining balance with nature. It teaches that the land is not just a resource to be exploited, but a living entity to be respected and cared for, with spirits that guard and protect those who honor the ancient covenant between humans and the natural world.

### 3. The Princess and the Eel

In a coastal kingdom of Timor, where the mountains met the sea, there lived a beautiful princess named Bi Hali. She was known throughout the land for her kindness and her love of the ocean. Every day, Princess Bi Hali would walk along the shore, listening to the waves and collecting seashells.

One afternoon, as she waded in the shallows, she noticed a sleek, silver eel swimming near her feet. Unlike the other fish that darted away, this eel seemed drawn to her. It swam in graceful circles around her ankles, its eyes shining with an almost human intelligence.

Charmed by the creature, Bi Hali began to visit the same spot every day, always finding the eel waiting for her. She would talk to it, sharing her thoughts and dreams, and the eel would listen, its eyes fixed upon her face with rapt attention.

Weeks passed, and Bi Hali found herself falling in love with the mysterious eel. She knew it was foolish – a princess and an eel could never be together – but her heart paid no heed to such practical concerns.

One day, as the sun was setting and the tide was low, the eel spoke to her. Bi Hali was startled but not afraid. The eel's voice was gentle and familiar, as if she had always known it.

"Princess Bi Hali," the eel said, "I am not what I appear to be. I am a prince from a distant kingdom, cursed by a jealous sorcerer to live as an eel. Only true love's acceptance can break this spell."

The princess, her heart racing, replied without hesitation, "I love you, whether you are eel or man. Your form does not matter to me."

As soon as the words left her lips, the water around them began to swirl. The eel was enveloped in a shimmering light, and before Bi Hali's astonished eyes, it transformed into a handsome young man.

The prince, overjoyed at his restoration, embraced Bi Hali. He told her his name was Liurai and explained how he had been cursed for refusing to marry the sorcerer's daughter. For years, he had searched for someone who could love him despite his eel form.

Bi Hali brought Liurai to her father's palace, where their story of love and transformation amazed everyone. The king, seeing the depth of their feelings and impressed by Liurai's noble character, blessed their union.

However, their happiness was short-lived. The jealous sorcerer, learning that his curse had been broken, was furious. He came to the kingdom, threatening to destroy everything unless Liurai agreed to marry his daughter.

Bi Hali and Liurai knew they had to find a way to break the sorcerer's power once and for all. They consulted the wisest elders in the kingdom, who told them of an ancient magic that could counter the sorcerer's dark powers.

The secret lay in the union of land and sea – a magic that could only be activated by a pair whose love bridged these two worlds. Bi Hali, a daughter of the land who loved the sea, and Liurai, who had lived in both realms, were uniquely suited to this task.

On the night of the full moon, when the tides were highest, Bi Hali and Liurai stood at the edge of the sea. As the sorcerer approached, weaving his dark magic, the lovers joined hands. They began to sing an ancient song, their voices blending with the rhythm of the waves.

The air around them began to shimmer, and a great wave rose from the sea, infused with the light of the moon. As the sorcerer raised his hands to strike, the wave crashed over him, its magic dissolving his powers and washing away his evil intentions.

When the water receded, the sorcerer was gone, transformed into a harmless sea creature that swam away into the depths.

Bi Hali and Liurai's love had not only saved themselves but had also protected their kingdom. Their story spread far and wide, a testament to the power of love to transcend boundaries and overcome curses.

From that day forward, the people of the coastal kingdom honored the union of land and sea. Fishermen would ask for blessings before setting out, and sailors would leave offerings at the shore, remembering the princess who loved an eel and the transformation wrought by acceptance and love.

Bi Hali and Liurai ruled their kingdom wisely, always maintaining a special connection to the ocean. It was said that they could often be seen walking along the shore at sunset, sometimes as humans, sometimes shimmering with scales, forever bridging the worlds of land and sea.

This tale of the Princess and the Eel became a beloved story in Timor, teaching the values of looking beyond appearances, the transformative power of love, and the importance of harmony between different worlds. It reminded people that true love knows no boundaries and that acceptance can break even the strongest curses.

### 4. The First Rooster

In the early days of Timor, when the world was still young and many things had yet to be named, there lived a village chief named Leki. He was known far and wide for his wisdom and fairness, but he had one flaw – he often overslept, causing the village's daily activities to start late.

The villagers, though fond of their chief, grew concerned. Crops needed tending at first light, and fishermen needed to set out with the early tides. They held a meeting to discuss the problem, but no one wanted to offend Leki by waking him each morning.

Among the villagers was a young man named Mau, known for his cleverness and his beautiful singing voice. He proposed a solution: "What if we had a creature that could wake not just our chief, but the entire village at dawn?"

The idea intrigued everyone, but they wondered how such a creature could be created. Mau suggested they ask for help from Maromak, the creator spirit who was said to dwell on the highest mountain peak.

The villagers chose Mau to make the arduous journey to Maromak's dwelling. For days, Mau climbed through dense forests and over rocky slopes. Finally, he reached the misty summit where Maromak resided.

Maromak, impressed by Mau's determination, listened to the village's plight. With a thoughtful nod, the creator spirit said, "I will grant your request, but there must be a promise in return. The creature I create will be faithful in its duty, and so must you be faithful to yours."

Mau eagerly agreed, promising on behalf of the entire village that they would always respect and care for this new creature.

Maromak then took a handful of clouds, a ray of the morning sun, and a echo of Mau's own voice. With divine craftsmanship, Maromak shaped these elements into a beautiful bird with a red crest and a proud tail.

"This is a rooster," Maromak explained. "It will crow at the first light of dawn, waking your chief and your village. But remember your promise – you must care for it and its descendants, for they will be the timekeepers of your people."

Mau returned to the village with the rooster, and the people were amazed by the beautiful bird. The next morning, just as the first rays of sun peeked over the horizon, the rooster let out a loud, clear crow. Chief Leki and all the villagers awoke, marveling at the punctuality of their new timekeeper.

Days passed, and the village flourished. Crops were tended early, fishermen caught the best tides, and everyone appreciated the regularity the rooster brought to their lives. Chief Leki, no longer oversleeping, became an even more effective leader.

However, as time went on, some villagers began to take the rooster for granted. They complained about its early morning calls, especially on days when they wished to sleep in. Some even suggested getting rid of the rooster altogether.

Mau, remembering his promise to Maromak, stood up for the rooster. He reminded the villagers of how their lives had improved and of the sacred trust they had been given. Most of the villagers came to their senses and agreed to honor their commitment.

But one night, a group of disgruntled young men decided to silence the rooster. They crept to its coop, planning to steal it away. Just as they reached for the bird, there was a blinding
