Pregnancy is divided into three trimesters, each spanning around 3 months or 13-14 weeks. Let's go through what usually happens in each trimester:
First Trimester (Weeks 1-13)

Morning sickness, fatigue, tender breasts are common in early pregnancy
Baby's major organs and systems begin forming
Milestone at 12 weeks: nucleic scan to check for abnormalities
Self-care needs: Getting enough rest, staying hydrated, taking prenatal vitamins

Second Trimester (Weeks 14-27)

Morning sickness usually subsides, energy levels increase
Baby is growing quickly - movements may start to be felt
Milestone at 18-22 weeks: anatomy ultrasound to examine baby's development
Self-care: Eating nutritious foods, gentle exercise like walking/swimming

Third Trimester (Weeks 28-40)

Baby continues rapid weight gain to prepare for birth
Common discomforts: back pain, swelling, shortness of breath
Milestone at 36 weeks: Group B strep test, baby's position monitored
Self-care: Pelvic floor exercises, researching labor comfort techniques
Preparing for baby's arrival - childbirth classes, setting up nursery

As you can see, both the fetus and the mother's body go through significant transitions each trimester. Prioritizing self-care like proper nutrition, exercise, hydration and rest can help manage the various symptoms and discomforts.
