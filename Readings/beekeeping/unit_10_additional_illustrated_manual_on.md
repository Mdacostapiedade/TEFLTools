Based on the provided context and the request for a comprehensive resource on top-bar hive construction using local materials for Unit 10, here's an illustrated manual tailored for Timor-Leste:

# Illustrated Manual: Top-Bar Hive Construction Using Local Materials in Timor-Leste

## Introduction

This manual provides step-by-step instructions for constructing a top-bar hive using materials readily available in Timor-Leste. The design is suitable for both Apis cerana and Trigona species.

## Materials Needed

- Bamboo poles (2-3 inches in diameter)
- Wooden planks (locally sourced hardwood)
- Palm leaves or thatching grass
- Natural fiber rope (coconut coir or similar)
- Beeswax
- Machete or saw
- Hammer and nails (if available)

## Step 1: Preparing the Hive Body

[Illustration: Bamboo poles being cut to size]

1. Cut 4 bamboo poles to 1 meter length for the hive body sides.
2. Cut 2 bamboo poles to 50 cm for the hive body ends.
3. Split the bamboo poles lengthwise to create flat panels.

## Step 2: Assembling the Hive Body

1. Arrange the bamboo panels to form a rectangular box.
2. Tie the corners securely using natural fiber rope.
3. Ensure the box is level and square.

## Step 3: Creating the Top Bars

1. Cut wooden planks into 30-35 cm lengths for top bars.
2. Shape one edge of each bar into a slight V-shape or round edge.
3. Rub beeswax along the V-shape to encourage straight comb building.

## Step 4: Making the Roof

1. Create a simple frame using bamboo poles.
2. Weave palm leaves or thatching grass over the frame.
3. Ensure the roof extends beyond the hive body to provide shade and rain protection.

## Step 5: Adding Features

[Illustration: Entrance holes and ventilation being added]

1. Cut small entrance holes near the bottom of one end of the hive.
2. Add ventilation holes near the top, covered with fine mesh if available.
3. Create a simple bottom board from a wooden plank or woven mat.

## Step 6: Final Assembly

1. Place the top bars across the hive body, ensuring even spacing.
2. Secure the roof to the hive body using rope or bamboo pins.
3. Place the hive on a stable platform off the ground.

## Maintenance Tips

- Regularly inspect bamboo for signs of wear or insect damage.
- Replace thatch roofing annually or as needed.
- Coat exterior bamboo with natural preservatives like neem oil to extend life.

## Adapting the Design

- For larger colonies, increase the hive length to accommodate more top bars.
- In very wet areas, consider adding extra roof overhang or using water-resistant materials.
- Experiment with different local woods for top bars to find the best option for your bees.

Remember, this design can be adapted based on locally available materials and specific needs of Timorese beekeepers. Encourage students to innovate and share improvements to the design within their communities.
