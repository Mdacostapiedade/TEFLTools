SCAA Green Coffee Grading Protocols

1. Overview
The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) Green Coffee Grading Protocols provide standardized methods for evaluating the physical quality of green coffee beans. These protocols are widely used in the specialty coffee industry to ensure consistency and quality.

2. Sample Preparation
- 350 grams of green coffee beans are required for evaluation
- Samples should be representative of the entire lot
- Beans should be at room temperature and free from external moisture

3. Primary Defects
Count and record the following primary defects in a 350-gram sample:
- Full Black Beans
- Full Sour Beans
- Dried Cherry/Pod
- Fungus Damaged Beans
- Foreign Matter
- Severe Insect Damage

4. Secondary Defects
Count and record the following secondary defects in a 350-gram sample:
- Partial Black Beans
- Partial Sour Beans
- Parchment
- Floaters
- Immature/Unripe Beans
- Withered Beans
- Shells
- Broken/Chipped/Cut Beans
- Husks
- Slight Insect Damage

5. Defect Equivalency Chart
- 1 Full Black = 1 Primary Defect
- 1 Full Sour = 1 Primary Defect
- 1 Dried Cherry/Pod = 1 Primary Defect
- 1 Fungus Damaged Bean = 1 Primary Defect
- 1 Foreign Matter = 1 Primary Defect
- 5 Severe Insect Damaged Beans = 1 Primary Defect
- 3 Partial Black Beans = 1 Secondary Defect
- 3 Partial Sour Beans = 1 Secondary Defect
- 5 Parchment = 1 Secondary Defect
- 5 Floaters = 1 Secondary Defect
- 5 Immature/Unripe Beans = 1 Secondary Defect
- 5 Withered Beans = 1 Secondary Defect
- 5 Shells = 1 Secondary Defect
- 5 Broken/Chipped/Cut = 1 Secondary Defect
- 5 Husks = 1 Secondary Defect
- 10 Slight Insect Damaged = 1 Secondary Defect

6. Grading Scale
- Specialty Grade: 0-5 full defects, no primary defects allowed
- Premium Grade: 6-8 full defects, primary defects allowed
- Exchange Grade: 9-23 full defects, primary defects allowed
- Below Standard Grade: 24-86 full defects
- Off Grade: More than 86 full defects

7. Screen Size
- Measure the percentage of beans retained on specific screen sizes
- Common screen sizes: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
- Report the percentage of beans above screen size 15

8. Moisture Content
- Measure using a calibrated moisture meter
- Ideal range: 10-12%
- Report to the nearest tenth of a percent

9. Color and Appearance
- Evaluate uniformity of color
- Note any discoloration or fading
- Assess overall appearance and consistency

10. Odor
- Evaluate the fragrance of the green beans
- Note any off-odors or taints

11. Cup Quality
- While not part of the green grading process, cupping is often performed alongside grading to assess flavor potential

12. Reporting
- Record all findings on a standardized SCAA Green Coffee Grading Form
- Include lot information, defect counts, screen size, moisture content, and any additional observations

13. Calibration and Training
- Graders should regularly calibrate their skills with other certified graders
- Attend SCAA training sessions and workshops to maintain proficiency

14. Equipment
- Precision scale (0.1g accuracy)
- Moisture meter
- Screen size trays
- Magnifying glass or loupe
- White surface for bean examination
- Proper lighting

15. Best Practices
- Grade in a clean, well-lit environment
- Use consistent methodology for each sample
- Document all findings thoroughly
- Re-evaluate borderline samples
- Consider environmental factors that may affect grading results
