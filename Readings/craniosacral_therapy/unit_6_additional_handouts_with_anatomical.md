Handouts with Anatomical Diagrams Adapted for Local Understanding

1. Craniosacral System Overview
   - Diagram: Simplified outline of human body highlighting:
     * Cranium (labeled as "Ulun")
     * Spine (labeled as "Kotuk ruin")
     * Sacrum (labeled as "Kidun ruin")
   - Key points in Tetum:
     * "Sistema Craniosacral" (Craniosacral System)
     * "Likidu Cerebrospinal" (Cerebrospinal Fluid)

2. Cranial Bones
   - Diagram: Skull with major bones labeled in Tetum:
     * "Ruin Frontal" (Frontal Bone)
     * "Ruin Parietal" (Parietal Bones)
     * "Ruin Temporal" (Temporal Bones)
     * "Ruin Occipital" (Occipital Bone)
     * "Ruin Esfenoide" (Sphenoid Bone)
   - Annotations: Suture lines highlighted with local analogies (e.g., "hanesan ai-tahan kain" - like leaf veins)

3. Dural Tube
   - Diagram: Spine and brain, showing dural tube:
     * Label: "Tubu Dural" (Dural Tube)
     * Highlight connection from cranium to sacrum
   - Explanation in Tetum: "Proteje sistema nervozu sentral" (Protects central nervous system)

4. Sacrum and Pelvis
   - Diagram: Lower spine and pelvis, highlighting:
     * "Sakru" (Sacrum)
     * "Knotak" (Pelvis)
   - Show connection to spine and legs using local body awareness terms

5. Craniosacral Rhythm
   - Illustration: Waves or pulse symbols overlaid on body outline
   - Tetum explanation: "Movimentu natural iha ita-nia isin" (Natural movement in our body)
   - Comparison to familiar rhythms (e.g., ocean waves, breathing)

6. Hand Placement for Basic Techniques
   - Series of diagrams showing proper hand placement for:
     * Cranial holds
     * Sacral holds
     * Spinal contacts
   - Use local terms for body parts and directions

7. Contraindications
   - Simple icons representing:
     * Head injury (cracked coconut symbol)
     * Recent surgery (knife symbol)
     * High blood pressure (traditional blood pressure cuff)
   - Brief explanations in Tetum for each contraindication

8. Integration with Traditional Practices
   - Illustration showing craniosacral therapy alongside traditional healing methods
   - Emphasize complementary nature, not replacement

9. Client Positioning
   - Diagrams showing proper client positioning on:
     * Massage table
     * Floor mat
   - Include culturally appropriate clothing and draping

10. Anatomical Landmarks
    - Outline of head and neck highlighting palpation points:
      * "Foho ki'ik iha ulun-kotuk" (Occipital ridge)
      * "Kuak iha tilun-kotuk" (Mastoid process)
    - Use local geographic features as analogies for shapes and locations

11. Cerebrospinal Fluid Flow
    - Simplified diagram of brain and spine
    - Arrows indicating fluid movement
    - Tetum explanation: "Be'e moos proteje hakarak no ruin kotuk" (Clear fluid protects brain and spine)

12. Before and After Treatment
    - Side-by-side body outlines showing:
      * Restricted areas (darker shading)
      * Post-treatment improvements (lighter shading)
    - Use local color symbolism for health and wellness
