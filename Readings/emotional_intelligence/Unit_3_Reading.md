Principles of Trauma-Informed Care in Timor-Leste

Timor-Leste, a young nation with a history marked by conflict and violence, faces unique challenges in addressing trauma within its population. As the country continues to develop its healthcare and social services, there is a growing recognition of the need for trauma-informed care approaches that are culturally sensitive and adapted to the Timorese context.
