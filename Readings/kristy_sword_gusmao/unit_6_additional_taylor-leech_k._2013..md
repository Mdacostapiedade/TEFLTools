# Learning Unit 6: Student Perceptions and Experiences

## Overview of Taylor-Leech (2013)

Taylor-Leech's (2013) article examines language policy and medium of instruction in Timor-Leste from 2000 to 2012, focusing on the challenges of finding space for non-dominant languages in education.

### Key Points:

1. Historical context: Timor-Leste's complex linguistic landscape due to colonial history and Indonesian occupation.

2. Language policy evolution: Shifts from Portuguese-centric policies to more inclusive approaches incorporating Tetum and other local languages.

3. Challenges in implementation: Limited resources, lack of trained teachers, and resistance to mother tongue-based multilingual education (MTBME).

4. Non-dominant languages: Efforts to include indigenous languages in education, particularly in early primary years.

5. Policy tensions: Balancing national identity (linked to Portuguese) with linguistic diversity and educational effectiveness.

## Relevance to Course Objectives

This article directly addresses several course objectives:

1. Analyzing language policy in education and national development
2. Evaluating benefits and challenges of mother tongue-based multilingual education
3. Examining strategies for preserving linguistic diversity in education
4. Critically assessing teacher training and pedagogy in multilingual contexts

## Key Concepts and Terminology

- Medium of instruction (MOI)
- Mother tongue-based multilingual education (MTBME)
- Language-in-education policy
- Non-dominant languages
- Linguistic ecology

## Timeline of Language Policy in Timor-Leste (2000-2012)

1. 2000: UNTAET administration, Portuguese and Tetum as official languages
2. 2002: Independence, constitutional recognition of Portuguese and Tetum
3. 2004: First language-in-education policy favoring Portuguese
4. 2008: Organic Law of MoE recognizes importance of mother tongue
5. 2011: Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education for Timor-Leste policy

## Challenges in Implementation

1. Lack of qualified teachers proficient in Portuguese and Tetum
2. Limited teaching materials in local languages
3. Resistance from some stakeholders to MTBME
4. Balancing national identity with linguistic diversity
5. Resource constraints for developing materials in multiple languages

## Strategies for Including Non-Dominant Languages

1. Phased introduction of local languages in early primary years
2. Development of orthographies for indigenous languages
3. Teacher training in multilingual education methodologies
4. Community involvement in language preservation and education
5. Flexible language policies allowing for regional variations

## Implications for Student Experiences

1. Potential improved learning outcomes through mother tongue instruction
2. Challenges in transitioning between languages of instruction
3. Impact on cultural identity and self-esteem
4. Preparation for higher education and employment opportunities
5. Varied experiences based on geographic and linguistic background

## Discussion Questions

1. How does Timor-Leste's language policy balance national unity with linguistic diversity?
2. What are the main obstacles to implementing MTBME in Timor-Leste, and how might they be overcome?
3. How does the inclusion of non-dominant languages in education affect student experiences and outcomes?
4. What lessons can other multilingual countries learn from Timor-Leste's language policy evolution?

## Activities

1. Case study analysis: Compare Timor-Leste's language policy with another multilingual country.
2. Role-play: Simulate a community meeting discussing the introduction of a local language in schools.
3. Policy review: Critically analyze the 2011 MTBME policy document for Timor-Leste.
4. Survey design: Develop a questionnaire to assess student attitudes towards language of instruction.
