1. Booklet 1: Policy Makers
- Rationale for MLE policies
- Steps for developing and implementing MLE policies
- Case studies of successful MLE policy implementation

2. Booklet 2: Programme Implementers
- Planning and implementing MLE programs
- Curriculum and materials development
- Teacher training and support
- Monitoring and evaluation strategies

3. Booklet 3: Community Members
- Benefits of MLE for children and communities
- Ways to support MLE initiatives
- Strategies for community involvement in education

4. Booklet 4: Advocacy
- Developing effective advocacy campaigns for MLE
- Key messages and target audiences
- Media engagement strategies

5. Booklet 5: Additional Resources
- Further reading on MLE
- Organizations supporting MLE initiatives
- Sample materials and templates

Main Themes:

1. Inclusion and equity in education
2. Preservation of linguistic and cultural diversity
3. Improved learning outcomes through mother tongue instruction
4. Bridging local languages with national/official languages
5. Community engagement in education

Relevance to Timor-Leste:

- Addresses challenges of implementing MLE in linguistically diverse contexts
- Provides strategies for balancing local languages with official languages (e.g., Tetum, Portuguese)
- Offers guidance on developing culturally relevant curricula and materials
- Emphasizes community involvement, which is crucial in Timor-Leste's context

Application in Course:

- Use case studies to compare with Timor-Leste's situation
- Adapt advocacy strategies for local context
- Analyze policy recommendations in relation to Timor-Leste's current language policies
- Develop sample MLE programs using the kit's guidelines
- Create community engagement plans based on Booklet 3

Key Takeaways:

1. MLE is crucial for inclusive and quality education in multilingual societies
2. Successful MLE implementation requires coordinated efforts from policymakers, educators, and communities
3. Advocacy is essential for gaining support and resources for MLE initiatives
4. MLE programs should be tailored to local linguistic and cultural contexts
5. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation are necessary for program improvement

Critical Analysis:

- Strengths: Comprehensive approach, practical tools, emphasis on local context
- Limitations: May require adaptation for specific country contexts, published in 2007 (consider updates)
- Potential challenges in applying to Timor-Leste: Resource constraints, political considerations, teacher capacity

Discussion Questions:

1. How can Timor-Leste adapt the advocacy strategies presented in the kit to its unique linguistic landscape?
2. What challenges might arise in implementing the kit's recommendations in Timor-Leste's education system?
3. How can community involvement in MLE be strengthened in Timor-Leste using the kit's suggestions?
4. What modifications to the kit's policy recommendations might be necessary for Timor-Leste's context?
5. How can the materials development guidelines be applied to create resources for Timor-Leste's local languages?
