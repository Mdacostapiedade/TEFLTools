Note: While these videos offer high-quality Qi Gong instruction, none currently provide Tetum subtitles. To make these resources more accessible for students in Timor-Leste, consider:

1. Collaborating with local translators to create Tetum subtitles for selected videos.
2. Developing short, original Qi Gong instruction videos in Tetum or with Tetum voiceovers.
3. Creating written guides in Tetum to accompany these videos, explaining key movements and concepts.
