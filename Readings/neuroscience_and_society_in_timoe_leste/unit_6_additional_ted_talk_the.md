   - Duration: Approximately 17 minutes

2. Key Concepts:
   a. Consciousness as a controlled hallucination
   b. Predictive processing in perception
   c. Interoception and emotional experiences
   d. The "real" and "unreal" self

3. Main Arguments:
   a. Consciousness is our brain's best guess about our reality
   b. Perception is a process of controlled hallucination

   b. Optical illusions demonstrating predictive processing
   c. Interoceptive predictions and emotional experiences

5. Implications for Timor-Leste:
   a. Understanding cultural differences in consciousness and perception
   b. Exploring traditional Timorese beliefs about the self and reality
   c. Potential applications in mental health and well-being practices

6. Discussion Questions:

   b. What are the ethical implications of viewing consciousness as a controlled hallucination?
   c. How can this understanding of consciousness inform education practices in Timor-Leste?

7. Activities:
   a. Conduct a simplified version of the rubber hand illusion experiment
   b. Analyze Timorese art and folklore for representations of consciousness and reality
   c. Create a mind map connecting Seth's ideas to traditional Timorese beliefs

8. Connections to Course Objectives:
   a. Enhances understanding of consciousness from a neuroscientific perspective
   b. Encourages critical thinking about the nature of reality and perception
   c. Provides a framework for exploring cultural influences on consciousness

9. Further Reading:

    - Perception
    - Embodiment

11. Assessment Ideas:
    a. Write a reflection paper comparing Seth's ideas with traditional Timorese views on consciousness
    b. Design an experiment to test aspects of predictive processing in perception
    c. Create a presentation on the potential applications of this research in Timorese society

12. Interdisciplinary Connections:
    a. Philosophy: Theories of mind and consciousness
    b. Anthropology: Cultural variations in perceptions of reality
