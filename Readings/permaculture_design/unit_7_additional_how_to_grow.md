Based on the syllabus and context provided, here's a comprehensive resource on "How to Grow More Vegetables" by John Jeavons, tailored for Unit 7: Community Engagement and Outreach of the Permagarden Design and Implementation course in Timor-Leste:

# Resource: Adapting "How to Grow More Vegetables" for Community Engagement in Timor-Leste

## 1. Introduction to "How to Grow More Vegetables"

"How to Grow More Vegetables" by John Jeavons is a seminal work on bio-intensive gardening. Its principles align well with permaculture and can be adapted for permagardens in Timor-Leste. This resource will focus on how to use Jeavons' methods in community engagement and outreach efforts.

## 2. Key Principles from Jeavons' Work

- Deep soil preparation
- Composting
- Close plant spacing
- Companion planting
- Carbon farming
- Use of open-pollinated seeds
- Whole system approach

## 3. Adapting Jeavons' Methods for Timor-Leste

### a. Cultural Considerations
- Respect traditional farming practices
- Integrate local crop varieties
- Consider local taboos or beliefs about agriculture

### b. Climate Adaptation
- Focus on drought-resistant techniques
- Emphasize water conservation methods
- Adapt planting calendars to Timor-Leste's seasons

### c. Resource Availability
- Use locally available tools and materials
- Emphasize low-cost, low-input techniques
- Promote seed saving of local varieties

## 4. Community Engagement Strategies

### a. Demonstration Gardens
- Set up bio-intensive demonstration plots in community spaces
- Use these plots for hands-on training sessions

### b. Participatory Learning Approaches
- Conduct field days where community members practice techniques
- Use before-and-after comparisons to show results

### c. Peer-to-Peer Learning
- Train local "garden champions" to share knowledge
- Facilitate farmer-to-farmer exchanges

## 5. Outreach Materials

### a. Simplified Guides
- Create visual, step-by-step guides for key techniques
- Translate materials into Tetum and local dialects

### b. Success Stories
- Document and share local success stories
- Use photos and testimonials from community members

## 6. Addressing Common Challenges

### a. Skepticism about New Methods
- Start small and show results
- Emphasize compatibility with traditional practices

### b. Resource Constraints
- Focus on techniques that require minimal external inputs
- Promote recycling and repurposing of local materials

### c. Land and Water Access
- Advocate for community garden spaces
- Teach water harvesting and conservation techniques

## 7. Monitoring and Evaluation

- Develop simple metrics for measuring success (e.g., yield increases, dietary diversity)
- Encourage participatory evaluation by community members

## 8. Long-term Sustainability

- Promote seed saving and exchange networks
- Encourage ongoing learning and adaptation of techniques

## 9. Case Study: Bio-intensive Garden in Aileu District

(Include a brief case study of a successful bio-intensive garden project in Timor-Leste, highlighting community engagement aspects)

## 10. Additional Resources

- Links to simplified versions of Jeavons' techniques
- Contact information for local agricultural extension services
- List of locally appropriate plant varieties for bio-intensive methods

By adapting Jeavons' bio-intensive methods to the local context and using effective community engagement strategies, trainers can promote sustainable, productive gardening practices that enhance food security in Timor-Leste.
