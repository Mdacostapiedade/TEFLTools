PhET Interactive Simulations

PhET (Physics Education Technology) Interactive Simulations are free online simulations for science and math education developed by the University of Colorado Boulder. These simulations allow students to explore scientific concepts through interactive, game-like environments.

Key features:
- Free to use and accessible online
- Cover topics in physics, chemistry, math, earth science, and biology  
- Highly interactive and visual
- Can be run on computers, tablets, and smartphones
- Available in multiple languages (though Tetum is not currently available)

Relevant simulations for this physics course:

1. Forces and Motion: Basics
- Explore Newton's laws of motion
- Visualize forces acting on objects

2. Energy Skate Park
- Investigate conservation of energy 
- See energy transformations in action

3. Waves Intro
- Observe properties of mechanical waves
- Experiment with frequency, amplitude, wavelength

4. Geometric Optics  
- Explore reflection and refraction
- See how lenses and mirrors form images

5. Projectile Motion
- Analyze motion of projectiles
- Change parameters like angle, initial velocity, mass

6. Gravity and Orbits
- Model gravitational forces and orbits
- Visualize Kepler's laws of planetary motion

Using PhET simulations in this course:

- Assign specific simulations to complement lecture topics
- Use in class for demonstrations and group activities  
- Have students explore simulations independently for homework
- Incorporate simulation-based questions on assessments

Benefits for students in Timor-Leste:
- Provides interactive visualizations of abstract physics concepts
- Allows experimentation that may not be possible with limited lab equipment
- Supports self-paced learning outside the classroom
