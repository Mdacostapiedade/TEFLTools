## 6. Creating Custom Assets

While using free assets is a great way to start, consider creating custom assets to make your game unique:

1. Use Piskel or similar tools to create simple pixel art sprites.
2. Record your own sound effects using a smartphone or computer microphone.
3. Compose simple background music using online tools like [Beepbox](https://www.beepbox.co/).
4. Design UI elements using vector graphics software like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (free and open-source).

## 7. Timorese Cultural Elements

To incorporate Timorese cultural elements into your game:

1. Research traditional Timorese patterns and symbols to use in backgrounds or UI elements.
2. Use images of local landmarks or natural features as inspiration for game environments.
3. Incorporate traditional Timorese music instruments or melodies into your game's soundtrack.
4. Base character designs on traditional Timorese clothing or cultural figures.

By utilizing these free resources and creating custom assets, students can develop unique, culturally relevant games while learning valuable skills in asset creation and management.
