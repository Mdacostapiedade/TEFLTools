10. Sumner, D., et al. (2019). "Challenges and opportunities for sustainable rice production in Southeast Asia." Journal of Crop Improvement, 33(4), 429-456.
    - Discusses sustainable rice production methods, including approaches to managing salinity.

## 6. Economic Analysis

11. Anik, A. R., & Khan, M. A. S. A. (2012). "Climate change adaptation through local knowledge in the north eastern region of Bangladesh." Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change, 17(8), 879-896.
    - Includes economic considerations of adapting to climate change and salinity in Bangladesh.

## 7. Timor-Leste Specific (Limited Research Available)

12. da Costa, M. D. J., et al. (2013). "Household food insecurity in Timor-Leste." Food Security, 5(1), 83-94.
    - While not specifically about saline agriculture, this paper provides context on food security issues in Timor-Leste that saline agriculture could help address.

These research papers offer a range of perspectives and findings relevant to saline agriculture in Southeast Asia. Students should be encouraged to critically analyze these studies, considering their applicability to Timor-Leste's specific context when developing their project proposals.
