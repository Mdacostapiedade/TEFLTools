Translated excerpts from classic tai chi texts:

1. Tao Te Ching (Laozi):
"The softest thing in the universe
Overcomes the hardest thing in the universe.
That without substance can enter where there is no room.
Hence I know the value of non-action."

2. The Tai Chi Classics (Wang Zongyue):
"In movement be like water,
In stillness be like a mirror,
Be responsive like an echo."

3. The Essence of T'ai Chi Ch'uan (Lo Ban Heng):
"Use the mind to lead the qi,
Let the qi sink to the dantian.
When the qi sinks to the dantian,
Naturally there is rootedness."

4. Treatise on Tai Chi Chuan (Zhang Sanfeng):
"Once you begin to move, the entire body must be light and agile.
Each part of your body should be connected to every other part."

5. Song of the Thirteen Postures (Unknown author):
"The qi should be excited,
The spirit should be internally gathered.
The postures should be without defect,
Without hollows or projections from the proper alignment."

6. The Mental Elucidation of the Thirteen Postures (Wu Yuxiang):
"If the yi [mind-intent] arrives, then the qi arrives.
When the qi and the body move together,
Then they follow the yi."

7. Five Character Secret (Li I-yu):
"Calm,
Relaxed,
Rooted,
Centered,
Balanced."

8. Tai Chi Chuan Treatise (Wu Cheng-qing):
"In advancing and retreating,
There must be folding.
In going forward or stepping back,
There must be changes."

9. Expositions of Insights into the Practice of the Thirteen Postures (Wu Yuxiang):
"If others don't move, I don't move.
If others move slightly, I move first."

10. The Six Harmonies (Unknown author):
"The hands harmonize with the feet,
The elbows harmonize with the knees,
The shoulders harmonize with the hips."
