The Limitations of Seeking and Objectifying the Divine

Throughout human history, people have sought to understand and connect with the divine. This quest has led to the development of numerous religious and spiritual traditions, each offering its own perspective on the nature of God or ultimate reality. However, a common thread among many of these traditions is the tendency to objectify the divine—to treat it as something separate and distinct from ourselves and the world around us. While this approach has its merits, it also comes with significant limitations that can hinder our spiritual growth and understanding.

Objectification of the divine is deeply rooted in human psychology and culture. It stems from our natural inclination to categorize and make sense of the world around us. By giving God a name, form, or set of attributes, we create a mental construct that we can relate to and interact with. This process has historical and cultural significance, as it has allowed communities to develop shared beliefs and practices centered around a common understanding of the divine.

However, this objectification comes with several drawbacks. First and foremost, it creates a sense of separation between the self and the divine. When we view God as an entity outside of ourselves, we establish a dualistic framework that can lead to feelings of disconnection or unworthiness. This separation can manifest in various ways, from the belief in a distant, judgmental deity to the idea that we must perform certain rituals or actions to bridge the gap between ourselves and the divine.

Furthermore, objectifying the divine often limits our understanding of its true nature. By ascribing specific characteristics or forms to God, we inadvertently place boundaries on something that may be inherently boundless. This limitation can lead to anthropomorphism—attributing human qualities to the divine—which can result in a narrow and potentially misleading conception of ultimate reality.

Another pitfall of objectification is the tendency towards literalism in religious interpretation. When sacred texts or teachings are taken at face value without considering their metaphorical or symbolic meanings, it can lead to rigid dogmas and a lack of spiritual flexibility. This literalism can stifle personal growth and prevent individuals from exploring deeper, more nuanced understandings of their faith.

In contrast to the objectification approach, many spiritual traditions advocate for a non-dualistic perspective. Non-dualism posits that there is no fundamental separation between the self and the divine or ultimate reality. This view is found in various mystical traditions across the world, including Advaita Vedanta in Hinduism, certain schools of Buddhism, and the teachings of Christian mystics like Meister Eckhart.

Non-dualistic approaches emphasize the unity of all existence and encourage practitioners to recognize the divine within themselves and all things. Rather than seeking God as an external entity, these traditions often focus on practices that help individuals realize their inherent oneness with the divine. This perspective can lead to a more inclusive and expansive understanding of spirituality, one that transcends the limitations of objectification.

In Timor-Leste, for example, indigenous spiritual traditions often reflect non-dualistic elements through their emphasis on the interconnectedness of all things. Many Timorese believe in a spiritual realm that is intimately connected with the natural world, blurring the lines between the sacred and the mundane. This worldview fosters a sense of unity and respect for all aspects of life, from ancestors to the land itself.

Even within Timorese Catholicism, which has been heavily influenced by Portuguese colonization, there are traces of non-dualistic thought. The integration of Catholic mysticism with indigenous beliefs has resulted in a unique spiritual landscape where the divine is often experienced as both transcendent and immanent—present both beyond and within the physical world.

While objectification of the divine has played a crucial role in the development of religious traditions and continues to provide comfort and structure for many believers, it is essential to recognize its limitations. By exploring non-dualistic perspectives and remaining open to more expansive understandings of the divine, individuals can deepen their spiritual experiences and foster a more inclusive worldview.

Ultimately, the journey towards understanding the divine may require a delicate balance between the familiar structures provided by objectification and the boundless possibilities offered by non-dualistic approaches. By acknowledging the limitations of seeking and objectifying the divine, we open ourselves to new avenues of spiritual growth and a more profound connection with the ultimate reality that underlies all existence.
