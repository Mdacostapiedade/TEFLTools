The Bardos After Death: A Journey Through the Intermediate States

Death is not the end, but rather a transition into new states of being, according to Tibetan Buddhist teachings. The concept of bardos, or intermediate states, provides a framework for understanding the experiences of consciousness after physical death. This paper explores two key bardos that occur between death and rebirth: the bardo of dharmata and the bardo of becoming.

The bardo of dharmata begins immediately after the cessation of breath and the dissolution of the elements that make up the physical body. In this state, consciousness experiences a series of vivid appearances of light, sound, and color. The fundamental luminosity or "clear light" of mind shines forth, free from ordinary conceptual thinking. For the spiritually accomplished, this presents a profound opportunity for liberation. However, for most individuals, these dazzling yet unfamiliar experiences may seem confusing or even terrifying.

During the bardo of dharmata, various peaceful and wrathful deities are said to appear. These are understood not as external entities, but as archetypal manifestations of one's own mind. The ability to recognize these appearances as projections of consciousness is crucial. Those who have trained in meditation practices like Dzogchen may be able to rest in the nature of mind and attain enlightenment at this stage. For others, the bardo of dharmata passes quickly, lasting anywhere from a few moments to several days.

Following the bardo of dharmata comes the bardo of becoming. Here, consciousness takes on a "mental body" that possesses extraordinary mobility and clairvoyant abilities. No longer grounded by a physical form, the mental body can move instantly to any location simply by thinking of it. It can pass through solid objects and perceive the thoughts of the living. However, it also experiences great vulnerability, subject to the winds of karma and plagued by confusion about its state.

The bardo of becoming typically lasts for 49 days, though this duration can vary. During this time, the deceased may not realize they have died and may attempt to interact with loved ones, only to find themselves ignored. As the mental body cannot take sustenance, it experiences intense hunger and thirst. Vivid karmic visions arise, sometimes nightmarish in nature. The mind becomes extremely sensitive and suggestible, with thoughts manifesting instantly as experiential realities.

It is in the bardo of becoming that the process of rebirth unfolds. Drawn by karmic affinities and propelled by habitual tendencies, consciousness is eventually propelled toward a new birth. In the final stages, it is said that signs appear indicating the realm and circumstances of rebirth. Those with spiritual training may be able to choose a favorable rebirth or even attain liberation, while others are swept along by the force of karma.

Understanding these bardos is not merely an academic exercise. Tibetan Buddhism offers a rich array of practices to support the consciousness of the deceased as it navigates these intermediate states. The practice of phowa, or transference of consciousness, can be performed by a qualified master to guide the dying person's awareness to a pure realm at the moment of death. Reading from texts like the Tibetan Book of the Dead (Bardo Thodol) provides step-by-step instructions to the deceased, reminding them of the illusory nature of bardo experiences and pointing out opportunities for liberation.

Prayers, mantras, and rituals performed by the living are believed to benefit the deceased in tangible ways. Because the mental body in the bardo state is so receptive, even small positive actions can have outsized effects. Loved ones are encouraged to cultivate positive states of mind, refrain from excessive grief (which can disturb the deceased), and engage in meritorious activities on behalf of the departed.

The bardo teachings offer a perspective on death that is at once sobering and hopeful. They emphasize the profound opportunities available at the time of death while also highlighting the importance of spiritual preparation during life. By familiarizing ourselves with these states in advance through study and meditation, we may approach our own deaths with greater confidence and clarity.

In conclusion, the bardos after death represent a crucial phase in the cyclical journey of consciousness according to Tibetan Buddhist thought. Whether one fully accepts these teachings or views them as metaphor, they provide a rich contemplative framework for considering the nature of mind, death, and reality itself. In a world that often shies away from confronting mortality, the bardo teachings offer a comprehensive vision of death as a vital part of the spiritual path.
