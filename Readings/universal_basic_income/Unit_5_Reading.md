Universal Basic Income in Timor-Leste: Fiscal and Economic Implications

The concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI) has gained traction globally as a potential solution to poverty and income inequality. For Timor-Leste, a young nation with significant oil wealth but persistent poverty, UBI presents both opportunities and challenges. This paper examines the fiscal and economic implications of implementing a UBI program in Timor-Leste.

UBI is a system in which all citizens or residents of a country receive a standard amount of money on a regular basis, regardless of their income or employment status. In Timor-Leste's context, implementing such a program would require careful consideration of costs, funding sources, and potential macroeconomic effects.

Cost Estimates for UBI in Timor-Leste

The total cost of a UBI program in Timor-Leste would depend on the amount provided to each citizen and the country's population. With a population of approximately 1.3 million, even a modest monthly payment could result in significant annual costs. For example, a monthly UBI of $100 per person would cost about $1.56 billion annually, which is close to Timor-Leste's entire GDP of $1.82 billion in 2020. This highlights the substantial fiscal commitment required for such a program.

Potential Funding Sources

Timor-Leste's primary source of government revenue is its oil and gas sector, managed through the Petroleum Fund. This sovereign wealth fund, valued at approximately $19 billion, could potentially finance a UBI program. However, using the fund for this purpose would require careful consideration of long-term sustainability, as oil and gas resources are finite.

Other potential funding sources could include:

1. Restructuring the current social protection system
2. Implementing new taxation methods, such as a progressive income tax or value-added tax
3. Diversifying the economy to generate new revenue streams

Each of these options comes with its own set of challenges and would require significant policy reforms.

Macroeconomic Effects

Implementing a UBI in Timor-Leste would likely have far-reaching macroeconomic effects. Some potential impacts include:

1. Inflation: A sudden increase in disposable income across the population could lead to higher demand for goods and services, potentially driving up prices. This effect might be particularly pronounced in Timor-Leste's small, import-dependent economy.

2. Consumption patterns: UBI could significantly alter consumption patterns. The marginal propensity to consume is likely to be high in Timor-Leste, given the large proportion of the population living in poverty. This could lead to increased economic activity in local markets.

3. Savings and investment: While much of the UBI might be spent on immediate needs, some portion could be saved or invested, potentially stimulating long-term economic growth.

4. Dutch disease: There is a risk that using oil revenues to fund UBI could exacerbate "Dutch disease" - a phenomenon where a country's non-resource sectors become less competitive due to currency appreciation caused by resource exports.

5. Labor market effects: UBI could impact labor force participation and wage negotiations. While some argue it could reduce work incentives, others suggest it might enable people to seek better employment or pursue education and training.

Challenges and Opportunities

Implementing UBI in Timor-Leste presents several challenges. The high cost relative to the country's GDP raises questions of fiscal sustainability. There are also concerns about the country's administrative capacity to effectively distribute payments to all citizens, particularly in rural areas.

However, UBI also offers potential opportunities. It could provide a safety net that helps alleviate poverty and reduce income inequality. By providing a stable income floor, it might encourage entrepreneurship and risk-taking, potentially diversifying the economy. UBI could also simplify the social protection system, reducing administrative costs and potential corruption associated with targeted welfare programs.

Conclusion

The implementation of UBI in Timor-Leste would be a transformative policy with wide-ranging fiscal and economic implications. While it offers potential benefits in terms of poverty reduction and economic stimulation, it also presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of funding and macroeconomic management. Any move towards UBI would require careful planning, robust economic analysis, and broad political and public support. As Timor-Leste continues to develop its economy and institutions, the debate over UBI is likely to remain relevant, reflecting the country's unique circumstances as a young nation with significant natural resource wealth but persistent development challenges.
