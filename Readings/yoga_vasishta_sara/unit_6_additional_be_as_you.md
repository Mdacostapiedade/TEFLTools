   - It is not the body, mind, or ego
   - Realization of the Self leads to liberation

3. Surrender:
   - Complete surrender to the Self or God
   - Letting go of individual will and ego
   - Complementary practice to self-inquiry

4. Meditation and yoga:
   - Emphasis on mental silence and self-awareness
   - Traditional yoga practices seen as preparatory
   - Ultimate goal is abidance in the Self

5. Karma and destiny:
   - Actions performed with ego-consciousness create karma
   - Self-realization transcends karma
   - Free will exists only in relation to the ego

6. Reincarnation:
   - Occurs due to unfulfilled desires and karma
   - Ceases upon Self-realization
   - Ultimate reality is beyond birth and death

7. The guru-disciple relationship:
   - True guru is the Self within
   - External guru serves as a mirror to reflect one's true nature
   - Grace of the guru aids in Self-realization

Practical Guidance:

2. Maintain awareness of the "I"-thought throughout daily activities
3. Practice surrender by accepting all experiences without resistance
4. Cultivate mental silence through meditation
5. Perform actions without attachment to results
6. Study and contemplate Ramana's teachings regularly
7. Seek the company of self-realized beings or sincere seekers

Quotes from Sri Ramana Maharshi:

1. "The thought 'who am I?' will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed. Then, there will arise Self-realization."

2. "Your own Self-realization is the greatest service you can render the world."

3. "Happiness is your nature. It is not wrong to desire it. What is wrong is seeking it outside when it is inside."

4. "Whatever is destined not to happen will not happen, try as you may. Whatever is destined to happen will happen, do what you may to prevent it. This is certain."

5. "The mind is a bundle of thoughts. The thoughts arise because there is the thinker. The thinker is the ego. The ego, if sought, will automatically vanish."

Exercises for Students:

1. Daily self-inquiry practice: Set aside 15-30 minutes each day to ask "Who am I?" and trace thoughts to their source.

2. Mindfulness of the "I"-thought: Throughout the day, pause regularly to notice the sense of "I" and its source.

3. Surrender practice: At the end of each day, review events and practice accepting them without judgment or resistance.

4. Study and contemplation: Read a passage from "Be As You Are" daily and reflect on its meaning in your life.

5. Group discussion: Share experiences and insights from practicing Ramana's teachings with fellow students.

Relevance to Yoga Vasishta and Timor Leste context:

1. Both Ramana's teachings and Yoga Vasishta emphasize non-dual philosophy and self-inquiry.
2. The concept of maya (illusion) in Yoga Vasishta aligns with Ramana's teachings on the nature of reality.
3. Ramana's emphasis on self-inquiry complements the Yoga Vasishta's methods for cultivating self-awareness.
4. The teachings on karma and destiny in both traditions can be explored in relation to Timorese cultural beliefs.
5. Ramana's practical approach to spirituality can be adapted to support the integration of Yoga Vasishta teachings into daily life in Timor Leste.
