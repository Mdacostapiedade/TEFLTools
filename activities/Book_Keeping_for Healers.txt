## Activity: Basic Bookkeeping and Financial Management for Healers

**Objective**: In this activity, students will learn the fundamentals of bookkeeping and financial management, which are essential for running a successful healing arts practice.

**Materials Needed**:
- Handouts with sample financial records (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement)
- Calculators (or spreadsheet software if available)
- Whiteboard or flipchart

**Warm-up (10 minutes)**:
Ask students to share their thoughts and concerns about managing finances for their future healing practice. This will help gauge their existing knowledge and address common misconceptions.

**Presentation (20 minutes)**:
1. Explain the importance of keeping accurate financial records for tax purposes, tracking expenses, and monitoring the financial health of the business.
2. Introduce the three essential financial statements:
   - Income Statement (Revenue - Expenses = Net Income)
   - Balance Sheet (Assets - Liabilities = Owner's Equity)
   - Cash Flow Statement (Cash inflows and outflows)
3. Provide examples of common income sources (session fees, product sales) and expenses (rent, supplies, marketing) for a healing practice.
4. Demonstrate how to record transactions and prepare basic financial statements using the handouts or spreadsheet software.

**Activity (30 minutes)**:
1. Divide students into small groups.
2. Provide each group with a handout containing fictitious financial transactions for a healing practice over a 3-month period.
3. Task each group to:
   - Categorize the transactions as income or expenses
   - Calculate the total income and expenses for each month
   - Prepare a simple income statement for the 3-month period
   - Identify potential areas for cost savings or revenue growth
4. Groups present their findings, and the class discusses any discrepancies or alternative approaches.

**Wrap-up (10 minutes)**:
- Emphasize the importance of regularly updating financial records and reviewing financial statements.
- Suggest affordable bookkeeping software or apps that students can use for their future practice.
- Remind students to consult with local tax authorities or accountants to ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

**Homework Assignment**:
Ask students to research and compare the pricing structures of different healing modalities in their local area. They should prepare a basic pricing strategy for the services they plan to offer, considering factors such as overhead costs, competition, and client affordability.
