# The Whispers of Ramelau

In the shadow of Mount Ramelau, where the mists cling to the slopes like reluctant spirits, I stayed. A humble structure of bamboo and thatch, it stood defiant against the winds that howled down from the peak, carrying whispers of ancient secrets.

I came to Timor-Leste to be somewhere that didn't remind me of anything. The wars that had torn this land apart had long since faded into uneasy peace, but the scars remained, etched into the very earth. In the markets of Dili, I had seen old women with eyes that held depths of sorrow I couldn't fathom. Their gnarled hands, stained with betel nut, would grasp mine as they pressed wilted vegetables into my palms, murmuring words I couldn't understand.

But it was the mountains that called to me. Away from the humid coast, where the air hung heavy with the scent of the sea and rotting fruit, the highlands promised a different kind of life. Here, the air was thin and cold, biting at my skin with teeth of ice even as the equatorial sun beat down mercilessly.

I chose a spot near a small village, though 'near' is a relative term in a land where paths wind treacherously through dense forests and along precipitous cliffs. The villagers eyed me warily at first, this strange foreigner who had appeared in their midst like a spirit from another world. But slowly, as the seasons turned and I remained, they began to accept my presence.

Old Mau was the first to approach me, his face a topographic map of wrinkles, eyes glinting with a mixture of suspicion and curiosity. He spoke no English, and my Tetum was rudimentary at best, but somehow we communicated. He showed me which plants were safe to eat, which would heal, and which held darker powers. Where its not safe to go to. Hey would take my hand, lloking into my eyes intently, and say, "You, you don't go over there. Don't go this way." pointing off into the distance with a gnarled finger. Under his tutelage, I learned to coax life from the unforgiving mountain soil, to read the moods of the capricious weather in the flight of birds and the rustling of leaves.

I remember meeting him for the first time. He stood there and when I motioned he sat down. I poured some beer and passed it to him and slip a plate of chips resting on a cardboard box a little nearer to him as if we had known each other a long time. He smiled and took a drink, ate some chips.

A woman named Maria took pity on me and showed me how to wash my clothes in buckets properly. 
A handful of children too young for school would come by and see what I was up to. I gave them some rubber bands and a few peices of candy I had, but then a troop of slightly older children came by a little later in school uniforms and ushered the young ones away with what sounded like stern warnings. I could almost translate without knowing the language, "If mom finds out you were playing with that old white dude..."
"No! Don't tell mom!", and off they run.

As the wet season approached, Mau helped me reinforce my simple dwelling. We wove palm fronds into a watertight roof and dug channels to divert the torrents that would soon cascade down the mountainside. At night, as we sat by the fire, he told me stories. Tales of the crocodile that became the island, of ancestors who walked between the worlds of the living and the dead, of magic that still lingered in the hidden valleys and on the mist-shrouded peaks.

I listened, enchanted, as the flames cast dancing shadows on the walls of my hut. Outside, the wind keened, and sometimes I thought I could hear voices in its wail – the ghosts of those who had perished in the long years of conflict, perhaps, or older spirits still, from before the coming of empires and armies.

The rains came with a fury that took my breath away. For days, the world outside my hut was a grey blur, water sheeting down in endless cascades. The air grew cold and damp, seeping into my bones. I huddled by my small fire, wrapped in blankets woven by the village women, and listened to the storm's rage.

In those long, dark days, I began to understand why the Timorese spoke of spirits and magic with such conviction. In the howling of the wind, the creaking of bamboo, the incessant drumming of rain on my roof, I sensed something – unseen but undeniably there. Sometimes, in the rare moments of quiet, I thought I heard whispers, words in a language older than any spoken by living tongues.

As the weeks wore on and the rains showed no sign of abating, a malaise settled over the village. Crops rotted in the fields, and even the most experienced hunters returned empty-handed from the forest. Children fell ill with fevers that burned hot as forge-fires, their eyes glassy and unseeing as they babbled of strange visions.

One night, as lightning split the sky and thunder shook the very foundations of the earth, there was a pounding at my door. I opened it to find Mau, his face grave in the flickering light of my lamp. "Come," he said, one of the few words of English he knew. I grabbed my coat and followed him into the tempest.

The village was a hive of activity, torches guttering in the wind and rain as people hurried about, their faces etched with worry. Mau led me to the house of the lia-na'in, the keeper of the word, the repository of traditional knowledge and spiritual power.

Inside, the air was thick with incense and the murmured prayers of the gathered villagers. The lia-na'in, a man whose age seemed beyond reckoning, sat cross-legged before a small altar. His eyes, when they fixed upon me, seemed to see through flesh and bone to the very core of my being. The villagers had generally become friendly but at that moment I felt like an intruder into something personal to the people of the village and I wished Mau hadn't taken me to this place.

He spoke, his voice dry as ancient parchment, and Mau translated haltingly. There was much I could not understand. Something about the rains, the anger of the spirits of the mountain. Balance had been disrupted, a sacrifice was needed, it was needed to pay for some thing very bad that had happened but I couldn't understand what it was.

The lia-na'in continued, and as Mau translated, my unease grew. He was explaining about a sacrifice, something about someone from beyond the sea.

I looked around the room, at the faces turned towards me – some fearful, some hopeful, some resigned. I thought of the sick children, the ruined crops, the relentless rains that threatened to wash away their very lives. And I thought of the whispers I had heard on the wind, the presences I had sensed in the long, dark nights.

Slowly, I nodded. "What must I do?" I asked.

The ritual began at midnight. Stripped to the waist, my skin painted with intricate patterns in dyes of red and black, I was led up the mountain. The rain had stopped, but the air was heavy with mist, and the ground was treacherous underfoot.

We climbed for what seemed like hours, the villagers chanting in low, rhythmic tones that seemed to pulse in time with the beating of my heart. At last, we reached a plateau near the summit. Here, the mist was so thick I could barely see my hand before my face. Someone pressed a wooden cup into my hand and Mau told me to drink.

The lia-na'in raised his arms, his voice rising in a keening wail that sent shivers down my spine. The chanting of the villagers grew louder, more urgent. And then, suddenly, silence fell. It was like a bitter, herbal coconut water. The climb continued.

Then, in that moment of quiet, I heard it – a whisper, clear as a mountain stream, in a language I had never heard but somehow understood. It spoke of ancient pacts, of balance and imbalance, of the price that must be paid to maintain the order of things.

I stepped forward, my feet moving of their own accord. The mist swirled around me, thickening until I could no longer see the villagers, could no longer see anything but white. I felt no fear, only a strange sense of peace and purpose. "The spirit is with us now", I hear the lia-na'in say. I couldn't recognize the language but I could understand him now, perfectly. I knew exactly what he meant because I could feel it inside me. 

My thoughts were dead quiet and still. I was aware of presence. Like an energy or a perspective or... like the spirit had taken over my subconscious mind and my will and attention were now drawn from a different vastly deeper more magical being.

Then the ground beneath my feet vanished, and I was falling, tumbling through space and time, through layers of reality I had never known existed. I saw the island as it had been eons ago, rising from the sea in the shape of a crocodile. I saw waves of people arriving – Melanesians, Austronesians, Portuguese, Indonesians – each leaving their mark on the land and its people. I saw wars and famines, times of plenty and times of want. And through it all, I saw the spirits of the land – in the trees, the rivers, the very rocks – watching, waiting, maintaining the delicate balance of existence.

Now, there was a torch in my hand and we were gliding through the jungle. I was exhausted by the climb up the trail but now, I couldn't really feel my body. It was as if my feet weren't even touching the ground. There were people or perhaps spirits all around me but I couldn't see their faces. At other times, I felt as though I were some kind of jungle cat running through dark undergrowth.

When I opened my eyes, I was lying on the plateau, the first rays of dawn painting the sky in shades of pink and gold. The villagers were gone. My body ached, and my skin tingled where the ritual paint had been applied. But I felt different – renewed, connected to the land in a way I had never been before.

As I made my way back down the mountain, I noticed changes. The incessant rains had stopped, and steam rose from the verdant forest as the sun's warmth penetrated the canopy. Birds sang in the trees, and in the distance, I heard the laughter of children.

In the village, I was greeted with disdain or gratitude. The sickness had passed, Mau told me, and the crops were already showing signs of recovery. No one spoke directly of what had happened on the mountain, but I saw it in their eyes – a recognition, maybe even a respect, and perhaps a touch of fear. I could see that for some, mostly the men of the village, I was no longer exactly welcome.

In the days that followed, I found my perception of the world had shifted. I could sense the ebb and flow of energies in the land, could hear the whispers of spirits in the rustle of leaves and the babbling of streams. The rituals Mau had taught me took on new meaning, and I found myself slipping easily into the rhythms of nature on the outskirt of this small village.

Seasons passed. 

But always, there was the mountain. Ramelau loomed over us, a constant presence, beautiful and terrible. On clear days, its peak seemed to touch the very heavens. On others, it was wreathed in clouds, unknowable and mysterious. And always, I felt its call, a tug at my soul that both thrilled and terrified me.

Sometimes, in the deep of night when the fire had burned low and the shadows danced on my walls, I wondered about the life I had left behind. It seemed like a dream now, insubstantial as morning mist.

In solitude and darkness, I learned to hunt for the presence of sprits and open my awareness to them.

As I write these words, the wind whispers around my hut, carrying the scent of rain. Soon, the wet season will be upon us again. But this time, I do not fear it. I am part of this land now, bound to it by ties stronger than blood. And when the spirits call, I will answer, for in their service I have found my true home.

In Timor-Leste, where the mountains touch the sky and the past is never far away, I have learned that magic is not found in grand gestures or flashy displays. It is in the quiet moments, in the connection between people and the land they inhabit. It is in the whispers of Ramelau.
