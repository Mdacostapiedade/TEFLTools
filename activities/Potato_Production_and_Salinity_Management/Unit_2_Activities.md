# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Salinity Guessing Game
- Display various water samples with different salinity levels
- Students taste a drop of each (safely prepared) and guess the salinity level
- Reveal actual EC measurements and discuss sensory perception vs. scientific measurement

## 2. Plant Detective
- Show images of various crops affected by salinity stress
- Students work in pairs to identify symptoms and affected crops
- Discuss observations as a class, focusing on potato-specific symptoms

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. EC Measurement Lab
- Students measure EC of soil and water samples from local farms
- Record results in a shared spreadsheet
- Classify samples based on salinity levels
- Discuss implications for potato cultivation

## 2. Virtual Field Trip
- Use Google Earth or similar to explore saline-affected areas in Timor-Leste
- Students identify potential causes of salinity based on landscape features
- Discuss how local geography influences salinity risk

## 3. Salinity Effects Demonstration
- Set up a simple osmosis experiment using potato slices in salt solutions of varying concentrations
- Students observe and record changes over time
- Relate observations to salinity effects on whole plants

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Salinity Management Plan
- Divide class into groups representing different regions of Timor-Leste
- Each group develops a salinity management plan for potato production in their assigned region
- Groups present plans to the class for feedback

## 2. Symptom Diagnosis Challenge
- Provide groups with sets of plant samples or detailed photos showing various salinity stress symptoms
- Groups compete to correctly identify and explain the most symptoms within a time limit
- Discuss findings and clarify any misconceptions

## 3. Irrigation System Design
- In pairs, students design a basic irrigation system for a small potato field, considering salinity management
- Pairs exchange designs and provide constructive feedback
- Class votes on the most effective and practical design

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. EC Calculation Worksheet
- Provide students with raw EC meter readings and conversion factors
- Students calculate final EC values and classify soil/water samples
- Self-check answers using a provided key

## 2. Salinity Threshold Analysis
- Give students a dataset of potato yields at various salinity levels
- Students create a graph and identify the salinity threshold for yield reduction
- Write a brief explanation of the results and implications for farming

## 3. Concept Mapping
- Students create individual concept maps showing relationships between salinity, plant physiology, and management strategies
- Encourage use of newly learned vocabulary

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Salinity Quiz Show
- Divide class into teams
- Conduct a quick quiz game with questions covering key concepts from the lesson
- Award points for correct answers and explanations

## 2. One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
- Collect papers to inform future lessons and address lingering questions

## 3. Salinity Management Charades
- Students act out various salinity management techniques without speaking
- Class guesses the technique and briefly explains its purpose
- Ends lesson on a fun, interactive note while reinforcing key strategies
