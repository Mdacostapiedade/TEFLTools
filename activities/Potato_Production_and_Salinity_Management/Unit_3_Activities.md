# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Salinity Detective

- Display various plant samples or images showing salt stress symptoms
- Students work in pairs to identify and list visible signs of salt stress
- Class discussion on observations and introduction to importance of salinity testing

## 2. EC Guessing Game

- Present water samples with different salinity levels (labeled with EC values)
- Students taste a drop from each sample (using clean droppers) and try to rank them from least to most saline
- Reveal correct order and discuss the relationship between taste and EC measurements

# Main Lesson Activities

## 3. Soil Sampling Relay

- Divide class into teams
- Set up an obstacle course with stations representing different parts of a field
- Teams race to collect soil samples using proper techniques at each station
- Judge teams on speed and sampling accuracy

## 4. Water Sampling Scavenger Hunt

- Hide water sampling bottles around the classroom or outdoor area
- Provide clues related to proper water sampling techniques
- Students search for bottles and must explain the correct sampling method for each location they find

## 5. Lab Report Puzzle

- Cut up sample lab reports into sections
- Students work in groups to piece together the reports and identify key salinity parameters
- Groups present their assembled reports and explain their interpretations

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 6. Salinity Management Plan

- Assign each group a hypothetical potato field with specific salinity issues
- Groups develop a comprehensive sampling and management plan
- Present plans to the class for peer feedback

## 7. EC Measurement Station Rotation

- Set up stations with different soil and water samples
- Pairs rotate through stations, measuring EC and recording results
- Compare and discuss findings as a class

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 8. Virtual Field Sampling

- Provide students with a digital map of a potato field
- Students use drawing tools to mark their proposed sampling points and patterns
- Submit plans for instructor review

## 9. Salinity Parameter Flashcards

- Create digital or physical flashcards with salinity-related terms and definitions
- Students practice matching terms to definitions and explaining concepts in their own words

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 10. Salinity Management Pictionary

- Divide class into teams
- One member from each team draws a salinity management concept or tool
- Team members guess the concept within a time limit
- Discuss and reinforce key points as concepts are revealed

## 11. One-Minute Paper

- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned about soil and water testing for salinity
  2. One question they still have about the topic
- Collect papers to assess understanding and address common questions in the next lesson
