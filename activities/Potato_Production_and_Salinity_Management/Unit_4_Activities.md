# Engaging Activities for Irrigation Management in Saline Conditions

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Salinity Charades
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group draws a card with a salinity-related problem (e.g., leaf burn, stunted growth)
- Groups take turns acting out the problem while others guess
- Discuss how proper irrigation management could address each issue

### 2. Irrigation Myth Busters
- Present a series of true/false statements about irrigation in saline conditions
- Students vote on whether each statement is true or false
- Reveal correct answers and briefly explain the reasoning

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Virtual Field Trip
- Use a series of photos or videos to showcase different irrigation systems in saline environments
- Students identify pros and cons of each system and discuss their suitability for potato production

### 2. Salinity Simulation
- Use a simple computer simulation or physical model to demonstrate salt accumulation in soil
- Students adjust virtual irrigation schedules and observe the effects on salt levels

### 3. Irrigation Scheduling Puzzle
- Provide students with puzzle pieces containing different irrigation scheduling factors (e.g., growth stage, ET rate, soil moisture)
- Students arrange the pieces to create an optimal irrigation schedule for potatoes in saline conditions

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Drip Irrigation Design Challenge
- In pairs, students design a basic drip irrigation system for a small potato plot
- Provide materials like straws, rubber bands, and paper to create a model
- Groups present their designs, explaining how they address salinity management

### 2. Leaching Fraction Calculation Relay
- Divide the class into teams
- Set up stations with different scenarios (soil EC, irrigation water EC, crop salt tolerance)
- Teams rotate through stations, calculating leaching fractions
- First team to correctly complete all calculations wins

### 3. Irrigation Management Debate
- Assign groups different irrigation methods (e.g., drip, sprinkler, furrow)
- Groups research and prepare arguments for their method's effectiveness in saline conditions
- Conduct a structured debate, with groups presenting pros and cons of each method

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Irrigation Schedule Creation
- Provide students with weather data, soil information, and crop coefficients
- Students create a weekly irrigation schedule for a potato crop, accounting for salinity management

### 2. EC Measurement Practice
- Set up stations with water samples of varying salinity
- Students use EC meters to measure and record the EC of each sample
- Students interpret results and recommend appropriate uses for each water source

### 3. Leaching Requirement Worksheet
- Provide a worksheet with various scenarios of irrigation water quality and soil conditions
- Students calculate leaching requirements and determine appropriate irrigation volumes

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. Concept Map Creation
- Students create individual concept maps linking key ideas from the lesson (e.g., irrigation scheduling, leaching, drip irrigation, salinity management)
- Share and compare maps in small groups

### 2. One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned and one question they still have
- Collect papers and address common questions or misconceptions

### 3. Irrigation Management Pictionary
- Divide class into teams
- Teams take turns drawing key concepts from the lesson while others guess
- Use as a fun way to review vocabulary and main ideas
