# Warm-up Activities

## Soil Sample Exploration
- Divide the class into small groups
- Provide each group with different soil samples (saline and non-saline)
- Ask groups to observe and describe soil characteristics
- Have groups share observations and discuss how salinity might affect soil properties

## Salinity Impact Brainstorm
- Create a mind map on the board with "Soil Salinity" at the center
- Ask students to call out potential impacts of salinity on soil and crops
- Discuss and categorize the impacts as the mind map grows

# Main Lesson Activities

## Gypsum Application Demonstration
- Set up a small-scale demonstration of gypsum application to saline soil
- Explain the process step-by-step, highlighting proper techniques
- Allow students to participate in measuring and applying gypsum

## Organic Matter Incorporation Simulation
- Use a large clear container filled with soil
- Demonstrate layering of organic matter into the soil
- Discuss the benefits of each type of organic matter as it's added

## Cover Crop Benefits Presentation
- Prepare a short slideshow on cover crop benefits for saline soils
- Include visual examples of different cover crops
- Discuss how each cover crop type addresses specific soil issues

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Soil Amendment Strategy Development
- Assign each group a different saline soil scenario
- Groups must develop a comprehensive soil amendment strategy
- Strategies should include amendments, organic matter, and cover crops
- Groups present their strategies to the class for feedback

## Crop Rotation Planning Challenge
- Provide groups with a hypothetical saline field history
- Challenge groups to create a 3-year crop rotation plan
- Plans should include main crops, cover crops, and fallow periods
- Groups justify their choices based on salinity management principles

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Soil Amendment Calculation Worksheet
- Provide a worksheet with various saline field scenarios
- Students calculate appropriate amounts of gypsum or other amendments needed
- Include questions on application methods and timing

## Organic Matter Percentage Assessment
- Give students soil test results from different fields
- Ask them to assess whether organic matter levels are adequate
- Students suggest methods to increase organic matter if needed

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Salinity Management Quiz
- Conduct a quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Use a mix of multiple-choice and short-answer questions
- Review answers as a class to reinforce learning

## One-Minute Paper
- Ask students to write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have about soil management in saline conditions
- Collect papers and address common questions or misconceptions

## Soil Amendment Matching Game
- Create cards with soil issues and corresponding amendments
- Students match the problem with the appropriate solution
- Discuss correct matches and the reasoning behind them
