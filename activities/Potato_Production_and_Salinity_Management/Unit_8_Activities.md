# Engaging Activities for Potato Harvesting and Post-Harvest Handling Lesson

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Potato Detective

- Display various potato samples (some from saline conditions, some from normal conditions)
- Students work in pairs to examine the potatoes and list observed differences
- Pairs share their findings, discussing how salinity might affect potato appearance and quality

### 2. Maturity Guessing Game

- Show images or samples of potatoes at different stages of maturity
- Students guess which potatoes are ready for harvest and explain their reasoning
- Discuss how salinity might affect these visual cues

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Salinity Impact Demonstration

- Set up a simple experiment comparing potatoes grown in normal and saline conditions
- Students measure and compare skin thickness, specific gravity, and dry matter content
- Discuss how these factors influence harvest timing and storage potential

### 2. Harvest Technique Role-Play

- Divide the class into small groups
- Each group acts out proper and improper harvesting techniques
- Other students identify and explain the correct methods and potential consequences of improper handling

### 3. Storage Condition Simulation

- Create mini "storage environments" with different temperature and humidity levels
- Place potato samples in each environment for a set period
- Students observe and record changes, discussing optimal storage conditions for salt-stressed potatoes

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Maturity Assessment Challenge

- Provide groups with potato plants grown in different salinity levels
- Groups perform maturity tests (skin set, specific gravity) and decide if potatoes are ready for harvest
- Teams present their findings and justify their harvest decisions

### 2. Storage Facility Design Project

- Groups design a small-scale storage facility for potatoes harvested from saline soils
- Designs must address temperature control, humidity management, and ventilation
- Groups present their designs, explaining how they accommodate salt-stressed potatoes

### 3. Harvest Planning Scenario

- Present groups with a scenario of a potato field affected by varying levels of salinity
- Teams develop a harvest plan, including timing, methods, and special considerations for different areas
- Groups share their plans and discuss potential challenges and solutions

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Potato Maturity Assessment Worksheet

- Provide students with data on skin set, specific gravity, and growing conditions for various potato samples
- Students individually determine harvest readiness and explain their reasoning

### 2. Storage Problem-Solving Quiz

- Present a series of storage scenarios involving salt-stressed potatoes
- Students identify potential issues and suggest solutions based on lesson content

### 3. Harvesting Technique Illustration

- Students draw and label a diagram showing proper harvesting techniques for salt-stressed potatoes
- Include explanations for each step to minimize damage

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. Salinity Management Bingo

- Create bingo cards with key terms and concepts from the lesson
- Call out definitions or descriptions, and students mark off the corresponding terms
- First to complete a line wins and explains the concepts in that line

### 2. One-Minute Paper

- Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned about harvesting and storing potatoes from saline conditions
- Volunteers share their insights with the class

### 3. Potato Handling Charades

- Write various harvesting and storage actions on slips of paper
- Students take turns acting out the actions without speaking
- Class guesses the action and explains its importance in managing salt-stressed potatoes
