Hands-on Activity: Preserving Timor-Leste's Bounty

Objective: To provide students with practical experience in two preservation methods suitable for Timor-Leste's climate and available resources: water bath canning and solar drying.

Materials needed:
For canning group:
- Ripe papayas (ai-dila)
- Sugar
- Lemon juice
- Large pot for water bath
- Clean glass jars with lids
- Funnel
- Ladle
- Clean cloths
- Tongs or jar lifter (if available)

For solar drying group:
- Green mangoes (has matak)
- Salt
- Large knife
- Cutting boards
- Solar dryer (simple wooden frame with mesh and clear plastic cover)

Instructions:

1. Divide the class into two groups.

2. Group A: Water Bath Canning - Papaya Jam

Step 1: Prepare the papaya
- Wash and peel ripe papayas
- Remove seeds and chop the flesh into small pieces

Step 2: Make the jam
- In a large pot, combine 4 cups chopped papaya, 2 cups sugar, and 1/4 cup lemon juice
- Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently
- Reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, until the mixture thickens

Step 3: Prepare jars
- Wash glass jars and lids in hot, soapy water and rinse well
- Keep jars warm until ready to fill

Step 4: Fill jars
- Using a funnel and ladle, fill jars with hot jam, leaving 1/4 inch headspace
- Wipe jar rims with a clean, damp cloth
- Place lids on jars and screw on bands until fingertip tight

Step 5: Process jars
- Place filled jars in a large pot of boiling water, ensuring they are covered by at least 1 inch of water
- Boil for 10 minutes (adjust for altitude if necessary)
- Remove jars carefully and let cool on a towel-covered surface

3. Group B: Solar Drying - Green Mango Chips

Step 1: Prepare the mangoes
- Wash green mangoes thoroughly
- Peel and slice into thin, uniform pieces

Step 2: Season the mango slices
- In a bowl, toss mango slices with a small amount of salt

Step 3: Arrange for drying
- Spread mango slices in a single layer on the drying trays of the solar dryer
- Ensure pieces are not touching each other

Step 4: Set up the solar dryer
- Place the dryer in a sunny, well-ventilated area
- Angle the dryer towards the sun for maximum exposure

Step 5: Monitor the drying process
- Check the mangoes periodically, rotating trays if necessary for even drying
- Drying may take 2-3 days depending on weather conditions
- Mangoes are done when they are leathery and no moisture is visible

4. Discussion and Sharing

After completing the preservation activities, bring the groups together to discuss:
- The process they followed and any challenges encountered
- How these preservation methods can benefit their communities
- Traditional preservation methods used in their families or villages
- Ideas for other local fruits or vegetables that could be preserved using these methods

5. Safety and Cultural Considerations

- Emphasize the importance of cleanliness and proper technique in food preservation
- Discuss how these preservation methods can complement traditional Timorese food storage practices
- Explore how preserved foods can support food security during lean seasons

This hands-on activity allows students to gain practical experience with food preservation techniques suitable for Timor-Leste's climate and available resources. By using locally abundant fruits like papaya and mango, the activity connects modern preservation methods with traditional Timorese ingredients, promoting food security and cultural continuity.
