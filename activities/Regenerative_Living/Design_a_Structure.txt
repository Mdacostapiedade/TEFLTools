VI. Hands-on Activity: Design a Structure (25 minutes)

Objective: To apply the knowledge gained about natural building techniques in a practical, context-specific design exercise.

Materials Needed:
- Large sheets of paper or poster boards
- Colored markers or pencils
- Rulers
- Reference materials on cob, straw bale, and earthbag construction
- Photos or diagrams of traditional Timorese architecture

A. Divide students into groups

1. Form groups of 4-5 students each, ensuring a mix of backgrounds and skills in each group.
2. Assign each group a number or name for easy identification during presentations.

B. Each group chooses one method (cob, straw bale, or earthbag)

1. Have each group discuss and select one of the three natural building methods:
   - Cob construction
   - Straw bale construction
   - Earthbag construction

2. Encourage groups to consider the strengths and challenges of each method in the Timorese context before making their selection.

C. Groups design a small structure suitable for a Timorese community

1. Provide a list of potential structures for the groups to choose from, such as:
   - Community center
   - School classroom
   - Health clinic
   - Storage facility for agricultural products
   - Eco-tourism accommodation
   - Cultural arts center

2. Instruct groups to consider the following aspects in their design:
   a. Site selection and orientation
   b. Foundation design
   c. Wall construction details
   d. Roof design and materials
   e. Openings (doors and windows)
   f. Interior layout and features
   g. Integration of traditional Timorese design elements
   h. Climate-appropriate features (e.g., natural ventilation, shading)
   i. Water management (collection, drainage)
   j. Potential for future expansion or modification

3. Design Process:
   a. Brainstorming (5 minutes):
      - Groups discuss ideas and sketch rough concepts
   b. Design Development (10 minutes):
      - Create more detailed drawings, including floor plans and elevations
      - Annotate drawings with construction details and material choices
   c. Finalization (5 minutes):
      - Refine designs and prepare for presentation

D. Groups present their designs, explaining material choices and construction process

1. Each group presents their design to the class (3-4 minutes per group):
   a. Introduce the chosen structure and its purpose
   b. Explain the rationale for selecting their natural building method
   c. Present the design, highlighting key features and how they address local challenges
   d. Describe the proposed construction process and any innovations or adaptations
   e. Discuss how the design incorporates traditional Timorese elements or responds to cultural needs

2. After each presentation, allow for a brief Q&A session (1-2 minutes) where other students and the instructor can ask questions or provide constructive feedback.

3. Concluding Discussion (5 minutes):
   - Facilitate a brief class discussion on the various designs presented
   - Highlight innovative solutions and thoughtful adaptations to the Timorese context
   - Discuss any common challenges or considerations that emerged across different designs

4. Reflection:
   - Ask students to reflect on what they learned from the design process and from seeing other groups' approaches
   - Encourage them to consider how these natural building techniques could be practically implemented in their communities

This hands-on activity allows students to apply their knowledge creatively, considering real-world constraints and cultural context. It promotes collaborative problem-solving and helps solidify understanding of natural building techniques in the specific environment of Timor-Leste.
