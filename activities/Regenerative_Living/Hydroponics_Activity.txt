Aquaponics and Hydroponics System Design Activity

Objective: To design a small-scale aquaponic or hydroponic system suitable for Timor-Leste's climate and agricultural context.

Materials Needed:
- Paper and pencils for sketching
- Colored markers or pencils
- Information sheets on local fish and plant species
- Sample aquaponic and hydroponic system diagrams
- Ruler or measuring tape
- (Optional) Pictures of local materials that could be used in system construction

Step 1: Understanding Aquaponics and Hydroponics

Discussion (15 minutes):
- What do you know about aquaponics, aquaculture, and hydroponics?
- How might these systems be beneficial in Timor-Leste?

Key Points to Cover:
- Definitions of aquaponics, aquaculture, and hydroponics
- Symbiotic relationship in aquaponic systems
- Relevance to Timor-Leste's agricultural and fisheries challenges

Step 2: Exploring System Components

Group Activity (20 minutes):
In small groups, list and describe the main components of an aquaponic system. Consider:
- Fish tank
- Filtration system
- Plant growing area
- Water and air pumps

Share ideas with the class and discuss the function of each component.

Step 3: Selecting Fish and Plant Species

Individual Decision (15 minutes):
Choose fish and plant species for your system from the provided options suitable for Timor-Leste.

Fish Options:
- Tilapia (Ikan mujair)
- Catfish (Ikan lele)
- Carp (Ikan karpa)

Plant Options:
- Leafy greens: Water spinach (Kanko), Lettuce (Alface), Pak choi
- Herbs: Basil (Xampu), Mint (Hortel√£), Coriander (Kutchae)
- Fruiting plants: Tomatoes (Tomate), Peppers (Ai-manas)

Guiding Questions:
- Which species are familiar and consumed locally?
- What grows well in your area's climate?
- What combination might provide a balanced diet?

Step 4: System Type Selection

Individual Decision (10 minutes):
Decide whether you want to design an aquaponic or hydroponic system.

Consider:
- Available resources (e.g., consistent access to fish feed for aquaponics)
- Space constraints
- Personal interest or experience

Step 5: Designing Your System

Individual Design (30 minutes):
Sketch a design for your aquaponic or hydroponic system.

Design Elements to Include:
1. Fish tank (for aquaponics)
2. Filtration system (for aquaponics)
3. Plant growing area
4. Pump locations
5. Water flow direction

Considerations:
- System size based on family or community needs
- Ratio of fish to plants (for aquaponics)
- Accessibility for maintenance
- Protection from extreme weather

Step 6: Peer Review and Refinement

Pair Activity (15 minutes):
Exchange designs with a partner. Review each other's plans and provide feedback.

Discussion Points:
- Is the system size appropriate for the chosen species?
- Are all necessary components included?
- How will water quality be maintained?
- Is the system designed for easy maintenance?

Refine your design based on feedback.

Step 7: Local Material Integration

Group Brainstorming (15 minutes):
Discuss locally available materials that could be used in system construction.

Consider:
- Recycled containers for fish tanks or plant beds
- Local plants for natural filtration
- Bamboo or PVC for piping
- Natural shade materials

Incorporate these ideas into your design.

Step 8: Water and Energy Management

Individual Planning (15 minutes):
Develop a basic plan for water and energy management in your system.

Include:
- Water source and replenishment method
- Energy source for pumps (e.g., grid, solar, manual)
- Strategies for temperature control in Timor-Leste's climate
- Water conservation techniques

Step 9: Production Schedule

Individual Planning (15 minutes):
Create a basic production schedule for your system.

Include:
- Stocking schedule for fish (aquaponics)
- Planting and harvesting times for crops
- Maintenance tasks and frequency
- Considerations for Timor-Leste's wet and dry seasons

Step 10: Presentation and Feedback

Class Activity (30 minutes):
Present your final system design to the class. Explain your choices and reasoning.

Classmates and teacher provide feedback:
- What strengths do they see in the design?
- Are there any potential issues to consider?
- How might the design be improved for the local context?

Step 11: Reflection and Next Steps

Individual Reflection (10 minutes):
Write a short reflection on what you learned and how you might apply this to a real aquaponic or hydroponic system.

Consider:
- How does this system address challenges in Timor-Leste's agriculture and fisheries?
- What benefits do you expect from this method of food production?
- What questions do you still have about implementing this design?

Optional Extension:
If possible, build a small-scale model or functional system based on one of the designs. Monitor its progress over time and compare it to traditional farming methods.

Conclusion:
This activity guide helps students understand the principles of aquaponics and hydroponics while applying them to Timor-Leste's specific context. It encourages critical thinking about sustainable food production, resource management, and the integration of new technologies with local materials and practices. The activity can be adjusted based on available time and resources, and can serve as a foundation for practical implementation in school or community projects.
