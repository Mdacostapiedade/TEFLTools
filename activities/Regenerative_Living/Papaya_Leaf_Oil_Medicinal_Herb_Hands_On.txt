Here's a hands-on activity to create a medicinal oil using local ingredients and techniques from Timor-Leste:

Hands-on Activity: Preparing Ai-Dila (Papaya) Leaf Oil for Skin Health

Objective: Students will learn to prepare a traditional medicinal oil using papaya leaves, a common ingredient in Timorese traditional medicine.

Materials needed (per group):
- Fresh papaya leaves (3-4 large leaves)
- Coconut oil (1 cup)
- Clean glass jar with lid
- Mortar and pestle (traditional stone if available)
- Cheesecloth or clean cotton cloth
- Small saucepan
- Heat source (traditional fire pit or modern stove)
- Labels and pen

Additional local herbs to consider:
- Ai-dik (Jatropha curcas) leaves - traditionally used for skin conditions
- Ai-damar (Canarium sp.) leaves - known for their anti-inflammatory properties
- Kabura (Plectranthus amboinicus) leaves - used for respiratory issues

Instructions:

1. Divide the class into three groups.

2. Each group will prepare papaya leaf oil, with the option to add one additional local herb.

3. Preparation process:
   a. Wash the papaya leaves (and additional herb if using) thoroughly and pat dry.
   b. Roughly chop the leaves.
   c. Using the mortar and pestle, grind the leaves into a coarse paste. In Timor-Leste, this is often done using a traditional stone mortar and pestle.
   d. In the saucepan, gently heat the coconut oil over low heat. In traditional settings, this would be done over a small fire.
   e. Add the leaf paste to the warm oil.
   f. Simmer gently for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. The oil should not be too hot - traditionally, elders test the temperature by touching the side of the pot.
   g. Remove from heat and let cool until comfortable to touch.
   h. Strain the oil through the cheesecloth or cotton cloth into the glass jar.
   i. Label the jar with the contents and date of preparation.

4. While preparing the oil, groups should discuss:
   - The traditional uses of papaya leaves in Timorese medicine (e.g., for skin conditions, digestive issues)
   - The properties of coconut oil and its significance in local culture
   - If using an additional herb, its traditional uses and properties
   - Sustainable harvesting practices for the plants used

5. After preparation, each group will present their oil to the class, explaining:
   - The process they followed
   - Any challenges they encountered
   - The intended use of their preparation
   - How this preparation fits into Timorese traditional healing practices

6. Discuss the importance of cleanliness and proper storage, especially in Timor-Leste's tropical climate. Mention that the oil should be stored in a cool, dark place and used within 3-6 months.

7. If possible, invite a local traditional healer (matan-dook) to observe or participate, offering insights into local healing rituals and the spiritual aspects of plant medicine in Timorese culture.

Safety note: Remind students that while papaya leaf oil is generally safe for topical use, they should always patch test new preparations and discontinue use if any irritation occurs. Also, emphasize the importance of sustainable harvesting, taking only what is needed and ensuring the plants can regenerate.

This activity combines traditional Timorese medicinal knowledge with practical skills in herbal preparation, while also promoting an understanding of local plants and sustainable practices.
