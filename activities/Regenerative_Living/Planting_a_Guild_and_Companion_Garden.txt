Plant Guild and Companion Planting Garden Design Activity

Objective: To design a small-scale plant guild or companion planting garden suitable for Timor-Leste's climate and agricultural context.

Materials Needed:
- Paper and pencils for sketching
- Colored markers or pencils
- Information sheets on local plants and their characteristics
- Sample plant guild diagrams
- Ruler or measuring tape
- (Optional) Seed catalogs or plant images

Step 1: Understanding Plant Guilds and Companion Planting

Discussion (10 minutes):
- What do you know about plant guilds and companion planting?
- Why might these practices be important for farming in Timor-Leste?

Key Points to Cover:
- Definition of plant guilds and companion planting
- Importance in sustainable agriculture
- Relevance to Timor-Leste's agricultural challenges (e.g., water scarcity, soil fertility)

Step 2: Exploring Plant Interactions

Activity (15 minutes):
In small groups, brainstorm and list examples of how plants might help or hinder each other. Consider:
- Nutrient needs
- Space requirements (above and below ground)
- Pest and disease interactions
- Effects on soil
- Impacts on local microclimate

Share ideas with the class and discuss.

Step 3: Selecting a Core Crop

Individual Decision (5 minutes):
Choose a main crop for your guild. This could be a staple food, fruit tree, or main vegetable.

Guiding Questions:
- What crop is important for your family or community?
- What grows well in your local area?
- What crop would you like to learn more about?

Step 4: Identifying Companion Plants

Group Research (20 minutes):
Using provided information sheets or local knowledge, identify potential companion plants for your core crop.

Consider:
- Plants that provide nutrients (e.g., nitrogen-fixers)
- Ground covers for weed suppression
- Pest-repelling plants
- Plants that attract beneficial insects
- Crops that use different soil layers

Make a list of 5-7 potential companion plants.

Step 5: Designing Your Guild

Individual Design (30 minutes):
Sketch a design for your plant guild or companion planting garden.

Design Elements to Include:
1. Central crop placement
2. Arrangement of companion plants
3. Spacing between plants
4. Vertical layering (if applicable)

Considerations:
- Sun and shade requirements
- Plant heights at maturity
- Root system types
- Water needs
- Harvest times

Step 6: Peer Review and Refinement

Pair Activity (15 minutes):
Exchange designs with a partner. Review each other's plans and provide feedback.

Discussion Points:
- Are all plant interactions positive?
- Is there good use of space?
- Will all plants receive adequate sunlight?
- How might this guild change through the seasons?

Refine your design based on feedback.

Step 7: Scaling and Layout

Individual Activity (15 minutes):
Determine the size of your garden plot and adjust your design accordingly.

Tasks:
- Decide on the dimensions of your garden area
- Scale your design to fit this space
- Calculate how many of each plant you'll need
- Consider paths or access points in the garden

Step 8: Planting Schedule

Individual Planning (15 minutes):
Create a basic planting schedule for your guild.

Include:
- When to plant each crop
- Expected growth rates
- Harvest times
- Any succession planting plans

Consider Timor-Leste's wet and dry seasons in your planning.

Step 9: Incorporating Traditional Practices

Group Discussion (15 minutes):
Share any traditional companion planting or polyculture practices you know from your family or community.

Questions to Consider:
- Are there local plants used for pest control?
- Do you know of any traditional crop combinations?
- How do elders in your community plan their gardens?

Incorporate relevant traditional practices into your design if applicable.

Step 10: Presentation and Feedback

Class Activity (30 minutes):
Present your final guild design to the class. Explain your choices and reasoning.

Classmates and teacher provide feedback:
- What strengths do they see in the design?
- Are there any potential issues to consider?
- How might the design be improved?

Step 11: Reflection and Next Steps

Individual Reflection (10 minutes):
Write a short reflection on what you learned and how you might apply this to a real garden.

Consider:
- How does this guild design address challenges in Timor-Leste agriculture?
- What benefits do you expect from this planting method?
- What questions do you still have about implementing this design?

Optional Extension:
If possible, implement a small version of your design in a school or community garden. 
Monitor its progress over time and compare it to traditional single-crop plantings.

Conclusion:
This activity guide helps students understand the principles of plant guilds and companion planting while applying them to Timor-Leste's specific agricultural context. It encourages critical thinking about plant interactions, sustainable agriculture practices, and the integration of traditional knowledge with modern design principles.
