Hands-on Activity: Seed Saving and Plant Propagation in Timor-Leste

Objective: To provide practical experience in seed saving and vegetative propagation techniques using locally available plants in Timor-Leste.

Materials needed:
- Mature fruits/vegetables for seed saving
- Healthy parent plants for cuttings
- Clean, sharp scissors or knives
- Small containers or pots
- Well-draining potting soil or local soil mix
- Labels and markers
- Plastic bags or clear containers for creating humidity

A. Divide students into groups of 4-5 people each.

B. Each group practices:

1. Saving seeds from local vegetables:

Option 1: Tomato (Tomati)
Materials: Ripe tomatoes, small container, water, fine sieve, paper towels

Process:
a) Cut ripe tomatoes in half and squeeze seeds and pulp into a container.
b) Add a small amount of water and stir.
c) Let the mixture ferment for 2-3 days at room temperature, stirring once daily.
d) After fermentation, add more water and stir. Viable seeds will sink.
e) Pour off the liquid, pulp, and any floating seeds.
f) Rinse the good seeds in a fine sieve until clean.
g) Spread seeds on paper towels to dry completely.
h) Once dry, store in a labeled, airtight container.

Option 2: Pumpkin (Lakeru)
Materials: Mature pumpkin, knife, spoon, colander, water, paper towels

Process:
a) Cut open a fully mature pumpkin.
b) Scoop out the seeds and pulp into a colander.
c) Rinse the seeds under running water, removing all pulp.
d) Spread clean seeds on paper towels in a single layer.
e) Allow seeds to dry completely in a well-ventilated area for 3-7 days.
f) Once dry, store in a labeled, airtight container.

2. Preparing cuttings for propagation:

Option 1: Cassava (Ai-farina)
Materials: Healthy cassava stems, sharp knife, planting containers or prepared bed

Process:
a) Select healthy, mature cassava stems from a disease-free plant.
b) Cut the stem into sections about 20-30 cm long, ensuring each section has several nodes.
c) Make clean, angled cuts to increase the surface area for root development.
d) Remove leaves from the lower part of each cutting, leaving a few at the top.
e) Plant the cuttings in prepared soil, burying about half the length.
f) Water well and keep the soil moist but not waterlogged.

Option 2: Sweet Potato (Fehuk midar)
Materials: Healthy sweet potato vines, sharp scissors, small containers with potting mix

Process:
a) Choose healthy vines from a productive sweet potato plant.
b) Cut 20-30 cm sections of vine, making sure each cutting has several leaf nodes.
c) Remove leaves from the lower half of each cutting.
d) Place the cuttings in small containers filled with moist potting mix.
e) Ensure at least two nodes are buried in the soil.
f) Keep the soil consistently moist and place in partial shade until roots develop.

Detailed explanation of the cutting process:

1. Selecting the parent plant: Choose a healthy, disease-free plant that exhibits desirable traits.

2. Timing: Take cuttings in the morning when plants are well-hydrated.

3. Cutting technique: Use clean, sharp tools to make a smooth cut. For cassava, make angled cuts to increase the surface area for root development. For sweet potato, cut just below a leaf node.

4. Preparing the cutting: Remove lower leaves to reduce water loss and prevent rotting when planted. For cassava, this also helps identify which end to plant.

5. Treatment (optional): In Timor-Leste, where rooting hormone might not be readily available, you can use natural alternatives like soaking the cut end in water infused with crushed willow bark or coconut water.

6. Planting: Plant cuttings in well-draining soil. For cassava, plant directly in the field or large containers. For sweet potato, smaller containers can be used initially.

7. Care: Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Provide partial shade until roots develop.

8. Monitoring: Watch for new growth, which indicates successful rooting. This usually takes 2-4 weeks.

Use of propagated plants:

- Cassava cuttings can be planted directly in fields for crop production.
- Sweet potato cuttings, once rooted, can be transplanted to gardens or fields to produce tubers.
- Both can be used to quickly multiply desirable varieties for distribution to other farmers.
- Cuttings can help preserve varieties that don't produce seeds or whose seeds don't breed true.

Basic grafting explanation:

Grafting is a more advanced propagation technique that involves joining parts from two plants so they grow as one. While not as commonly practiced in traditional Timorese agriculture, it can be useful for fruit trees.

Basic steps:
1. Prepare the rootstock: Choose a plant with a strong root system, cut off the top.
2. Prepare the scion: Take a cutting from the desired variety, usually containing 3-4 buds.
3. Join rootstock and scion: Make matching cuts on both and fit them together.
4. Secure the graft: Wrap the joint with grafting tape or a strip of plastic.
5. Care: Keep the graft warm and moist until it heals and new growth appears.

In Timor-Leste, this technique could be used to propagate improved varieties of mango or citrus onto hardy local rootstocks.

C. Groups explain their process and expected outcomes:

After completing the activities, each group should present their work to the class, explaining:

1. Which plants they worked with and why they chose them.
2. The steps they followed in the seed saving or cutting process.
3. Any challenges they encountered and how they addressed them.
4. Their expectations for seed germination or cutting growth.
5. How they plan to care for their seeds or cuttings.
6. Potential uses for the plants once they grow.

This hands-on activity allows students to gain practical experience with seed saving and vegetative propagation using plants common in Timor-Leste. It reinforces the theoretical knowledge with practical skills and encourages discussion about local plant varieties and propagation methods.
