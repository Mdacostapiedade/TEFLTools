Explanation:

File handling: reading and writing text files

The read_write_text_file() function demonstrates how to write to and read from a text file using the open() function with the appropriate mode ("w" for writing and "r" for reading).
The with statement is used to ensure proper closing of the file, even if an exception occurs.


CSV file handling

The read_write_csv_file() function shows how to write to and read from a CSV file using the csv module.
The csv.writer() is used to write rows of data to the CSV file, and csv.reader() is used to read rows from the CSV file.


Exception handling: try, except, finally

The exception_handling() function demonstrates the usage of try, except, and finally blocks for handling exceptions.
In this example, we deliberately divide by zero to raise a ZeroDivisionError exception, which is caught in the except block.
The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.


Adding data from a list comprehension to a file

The list_comprehension_to_file() function shows how to add data generated from a list comprehension to a file.
We create a list of squared numbers using a list comprehension and then write each number to a file.


Cool tricks with files

The file_tricks() function demonstrates a couple of cool tricks you can do with files.
We count the number of lines in a file by summing up the count of lines using a generator expression.
We read the lines of a file in reverse order by using readlines() to read all the lines into a list and then iterating over the reversed list.



When you run this script, it will execute each function and demonstrate the different aspects of file handling, exception handling, and some cool file tricks.
The script will create and write to text files (example.txt and squared_numbers.txt) and a CSV file (example.csv). It will also read the contents of these files and print them to the console.
The exception handling example will deliberately raise a ZeroDivisionError exception and catch it, printing an error message.
Finally, the script will demonstrate counting the number of lines in a file and reading a file in reverse order.
This script provides a comprehensive overview of file handling, CSV and text file handling, exception handling, and some interesting file manipulation techniques in Python.
