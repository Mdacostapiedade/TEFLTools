# Warm-up Activities

## Body Mapping
- In pairs, participants draw an outline of a pregnant woman on large paper
- Label areas where common pregnancy discomforts occur
- Share and discuss with the larger group

## Pregnancy Discomfort Charades
- Write common pregnancy discomforts on slips of paper
- Participants take turns acting out the discomfort without words
- Others guess the discomfort being portrayed

# Main Lesson Activities

## Acupoint Treasure Hunt
- Hide pictures of acupoints around the room
- Participants search for the pictures and match them to the correct point on a body diagram
- Discuss the function of each point as they are found

## Meridian Tracing
- Using washable markers, participants trace major meridians on each other
- Instructor guides the class in following the paths of qi flow
- Discuss how these pathways relate to the acupoints learned

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Acupressure Technique Rotation
- Set up stations for each acupoint being taught
- Pairs rotate through stations, practicing locating and stimulating each point
- Partners provide feedback on technique and pressure

## Case Study Analysis
- Provide written case studies of pregnant women with various discomforts
- Groups discuss and decide which acupoints would be most beneficial
- Present recommendations to the class, explaining their reasoning

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Self-Acupressure Journal
- Participants practice applying acupressure on themselves for 5 minutes daily
- Keep a journal noting the points used, duration, and any effects observed
- Share experiences in the next class

## Acupoint Locator App
- If available, use a mobile app that helps locate acupoints
- Participants practice finding points on themselves using the app as a guide
- Compare app guidance with manual techniques learned in class

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Acupressure Bingo
- Create bingo cards with acupoints, their functions, and key terms
- Instructor calls out descriptions or indications
- Participants mark their cards if they have the matching point or term

## Relaxation Visualization
- Guide participants through a brief relaxation exercise
- Incorporate visualization of qi flowing through meridians and acupoints
- End with gentle self-massage of a key acupoint (e.g., Yintang for relaxation)

## Knowledge Web
- As a group, create a mind map on the whiteboard
- Start with "Acupressure for Pregnancy" in the center
- Participants add branches for points learned, their functions, and safety considerations
- Discuss connections and review key concepts as the web is created
