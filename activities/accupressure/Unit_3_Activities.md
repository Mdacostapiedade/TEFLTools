# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Birth Story Circle (10 minutes)
- Participants sit in a circle and briefly share a positive birth story they've experienced or heard about in their community.
- Facilitator notes common themes or practices mentioned.

## 2. Acupressure Point Scavenger Hunt (5 minutes)
- Participants receive a simple body outline with 5 key acupressure points marked.
- They must locate these points on their own body or a partner's within the time limit.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Acupressure Point Demonstration (15 minutes)
- Facilitator demonstrates each key acupressure point on a volunteer or mannequin.
- Participants follow along, locating points on themselves or a partner.

## 2. Labor Stage Scenarios (20 minutes)
- Facilitator presents different labor scenarios (e.g., early labor, transition, pushing).
- Participants suggest appropriate acupressure points for each scenario and explain their reasoning.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Acupressure Technique Rotation (30 minutes)
- Divide into small groups and rotate through stations:
  - Station 1: SP6 and LI4 practice
  - Station 2: BL32 and GB21 practice
  - Station 3: KD1 and review of all points
- Groups spend 10 minutes at each station, practicing techniques and providing feedback to each other.

## 2. Visual Aid Creation (20 minutes)
- In pairs, create a simple, culturally appropriate visual aid showing key acupressure points for labor.
- Use local materials (e.g., colored paper, markers) to make the aid engaging and easy to understand.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Point Location Speed Drill (5 minutes)
- Facilitator calls out acupressure points rapidly.
- Participants quickly locate and apply pressure to each point on themselves.

## 2. Technique Refinement (10 minutes)
- Participants practice applying the correct pressure and technique for each point.
- Facilitator observes and provides individual feedback.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Acupressure Charades (10 minutes)
- Participants take turns acting out a labor scenario or discomfort.
- Others guess the scenario and suggest appropriate acupressure points to address it.

## 2. Reflection Circle (5 minutes)
- Participants share one new thing they learned and one way they plan to use acupressure in their practice.

## 3. Quick Quiz (5 minutes)
- Facilitator presents brief labor scenarios.
- Participants hold up fingers to indicate which acupressure point(s) they would use (1 for SP6, 2 for LI4, etc.).
