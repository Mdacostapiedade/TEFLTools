- One student is the "body," while others act as the planes intersecting it

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Anatomical Vocabulary Crossword
- Students complete a crossword puzzle using key anatomical terms and their definitions

## Homeostasis Scenario Analysis
- Provide students with various scenarios (e.g., dehydration, fever)
- Students write brief explanations of how the body would respond to maintain homeostasis

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Anatomy and Physiology Pictionary
- Quick-draw game using terms and concepts from the lesson
