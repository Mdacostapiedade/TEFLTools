# Warm-up Activities

## Reflex Race
- In pairs, students test each other's reflexes using reflex hammers
- Record the number of successful knee-jerk reflexes in 30 seconds
- Discuss why some people might have faster reflexes than others

## Muscle Memory Challenge
- Students attempt to write their name with their non-dominant hand
- Reflect on why this is challenging and how it relates to muscle control

# Main Lesson Activities

## Muscle Fiber Origami
- Students create paper models of muscle fibers, including sarcomeres
- Use different colors to represent actin and myosin filaments
- Demonstrate the sliding filament theory by manipulating the paper model

## Neuron Relay
- Set up an obstacle course in the classroom
- Students form a "neuron chain," passing a small object (representing a nerve impulse) from one to another
- Time how quickly the "impulse" can travel through the entire class

## Synapse Simulation
- Use colored water and food coloring to represent neurotransmitters
- Students act as pre- and post-synaptic neurons, transferring "neurotransmitters" between cups

# Group Work Tasks

## Muscle Movement Mapping
- In groups of 3-4, students create a large diagram of the human body
- Identify and label major muscle groups
- Draw arrows to show the direction of movement for each muscle group
- Present findings to the class

## Nervous System News Report
- Groups prepare a short "news report" on a specific part of the nervous system
- Include key facts, functions, and any recent scientific discoveries
- Present the report in a creative way (e.g., as a TV broadcast, podcast, or newspaper article)

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Muscle and Nerve Crossword
- Students complete a crossword puzzle with key terms from the lesson
- Clues should require understanding of concepts, not just memorization

## Reflex Arc Illustration
- Each student draws and labels a reflex arc diagram
- Include all components: receptor, sensory neuron, interneuron, motor neuron, and effector
- Write a brief explanation of how the reflex arc works

# Cool-down Activities

## Muscle and Nerve Charades
- Students take turns acting out various muscle movements or nervous system functions
- Class tries to guess what is being demonstrated

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the prompt: "How do muscles and nerves work together to keep us alive?"
- Share responses with a partner and discuss any differences in understanding

## System Connection
- As a class, create a mind map on the board showing how the muscular and nervous systems connect to other body systems
- Discuss the importance of these connections for overall health and bodily function
