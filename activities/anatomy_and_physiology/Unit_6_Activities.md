# Engaging Activities for Digestive and Urinary Systems Lesson

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Body System Pictionary (10 minutes)
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group draws an organ from the digestive or urinary system
- Other groups guess the organ and its function

### 2. "What Am I?" Riddles (5 minutes)
- Teacher reads riddles about digestive/urinary organs
- Students raise hands to guess the answer
- Example: "I'm a long, winding tube where most nutrient absorption occurs. What am I?" (Small intestine)

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Digestive System Journey (20 minutes)
- Students form a human digestive system chain
- Each student represents an organ or process
- Pass a "food item" (ball) through the chain
- Each student explains their organ's role in digestion

### 2. Kidney Function Demonstration (15 minutes)
- Use a large sieve, coffee filter, and various materials (sand, pebbles, water, food coloring)
- Demonstrate filtration, reabsorption, and secretion
- Students predict and observe what passes through each stage

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Digestive Enzyme Action Role-play (15 minutes)
- Pairs act out enzyme-substrate interactions
- One student is the enzyme, the other the substrate
- Create simple choreography to show how enzymes break down nutrients

### 2. Urinary System Puzzle Challenge (20 minutes)
- Groups receive puzzle pieces of the urinary system
- Race to correctly assemble and label the system
- Bonus points for explaining the function of each part

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Digestive System Flowchart (15 minutes)
- Students create a flowchart of the digestive process
- Include mechanical and chemical digestion steps
- Add key enzymes and their functions at each stage

### 2. Nephron Labeling and Function Matching (10 minutes)
- Provide a large diagram of a nephron
- Students label parts and match functions to each section
- Write a brief explanation of urine formation process

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. System Connection Game (10 minutes)
- Class forms a circle
- One student states a fact about the digestive or urinary system
- Next student must connect it to another fact or organ
- Continue until all major concepts are reviewed

### 2. One-Minute Paper (5 minutes)
- Students write for one minute answering:
  1. What was the most important thing you learned today?
  2. What question do you still have about the digestive or urinary system?
- Share responses with a partner or small group

### 3. Organ Function Charades (10 minutes)
- Students draw cards with organ names
- Act out the function of the organ without speaking
- Class guesses the organ and explains its role in the body
