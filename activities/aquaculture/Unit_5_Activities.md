## 1. Warm-up Activities

### Aquaculture Pictionary (15 minutes)
- Divide the class into small teams
- Each team takes turns sending a member to draw aquaculture-related terms

### Jigsaw Learning: Aquaculture Challenges and Opportunities (30 minutes)
- Divide students into "expert groups" focusing on different aspects:
  1. Environmental challenges
  2. Economic opportunities
  3. Social impacts
  4. Technological innovations
- Each group researches their topic and becomes "experts"
- Regroup students so each new group has one expert from each original group
- Experts share their knowledge with their new group

### Policy Puzzle (25 minutes)
- Provide students with scrambled pieces of Timor-Leste's aquaculture policies
- In pairs, students piece together the policy fragments
- Discuss how each policy element contributes to sustainable development

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Sustainable Aquaculture Farm Design Challenge (45 minutes)
- In groups of 4-5, students design a sustainable aquaculture farm for a specific region in Timor-Leste
- Provide maps, local data, and resource constraints
- Groups create a poster or digital presentation of their design
- Each group presents their design, explaining how it addresses sustainability challenges

### Stakeholder Roundtable Simulation (30 minutes)
- Assign each group a stakeholder role: government officials, local fishermen, environmental NGOs, aquaculture business owners
- Groups discuss a proposed aquaculture development project
- Each group presents their perspective and concerns
- The class works together to find compromises and solutions

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Sustainable Practices Matching Game (15 minutes)
- Provide a list of aquaculture practices and sustainability outcomes
- Students match practices to their corresponding sustainability benefits
- Discuss answers as a class, explaining the connections

### Case Study Analysis (20 minutes)
- Provide a brief case study of an aquaculture project in a similar context to Timor-Leste
- Students individually analyze the case, identifying successes, challenges, and lessons learned
- Write a short reflection on how these lessons could apply to Timor-Leste

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 3-2-1 Reflection (10 minutes)
- Students write down:
  * 3 things they learned
  * 2 questions they still have
  * 1 way they can apply this knowledge
