# Warm-up Activities

## Marine Species Bingo
- Create bingo cards with images of various marine species found in Timor-Leste
- As you display and briefly describe each species, students mark their cards
- First student to complete a row calls "Bingo!" and shares one fact about each species in their winning row

## Two Truths and a Lie: Marine Edition
- Students write down two true facts and one false statement about Timor-Leste's marine life
- In pairs, students try to guess which statement is false
- Share interesting facts with the whole class

# Main Lesson Activities

## Marine Ecosystem Jigsaw
- Divide class into expert groups, each focusing on a different marine habitat (coral reef, mangrove, seagrass bed)
- Expert groups research their habitat's characteristics and inhabitants
- Regroup into mixed teams to share knowledge and create a comprehensive ecosystem map

## Species Role-Play
- Assign each student a marine species (fish, coral, turtle, etc.)
- Students research their species' characteristics and ecological role
- In small groups, students introduce themselves as their species and explain their importance in the ecosystem

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Food Web Construction Challenge
- In groups of 4-5, provide a set of cards with different marine species
- Groups arrange cards and draw arrows to create a food web
- Present food webs to the class, explaining energy flow and interdependencies

## Marine Conservation Poster Design
- Pairs choose a marine species or habitat to focus on
- Create an informative and visually appealing poster highlighting:
  * Key characteristics
  * Ecological importance
  * Threats faced
  * Conservation measures

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Species Identification Quiz
- Show images of various marine species found in Timor-Leste
- Students individually identify species and note key characteristics
- Self-check answers using provided guidebooks

## Ecological Role Matching
- Provide a list of marine species and a separate list of ecological roles
- Students match each species to its primary ecological role
- Extend by asking students to explain their choices

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Marine Biodiversity Reflection
- Students write a brief reflection answering:
  * What new species did you learn about today?
  * Why is marine biodiversity important for Timor-Leste?
  * How can you contribute to marine conservation?

## Ecosystem Connections Game
- Stand in a circle, holding a ball of yarn
- First person names a marine species and tosses the yarn to someone else
- Next person names a species connected to the first (predator, prey, habitat)
- Continue until a complex web is formed, demonstrating ecosystem interconnectedness
