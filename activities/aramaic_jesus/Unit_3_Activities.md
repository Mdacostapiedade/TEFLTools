# Warm-up Activities

## Marine Ecosystem Comparison
- Display images of healthy and degraded marine ecosystems in Timor-Leste
- Students discuss in pairs:
  1. What differences do you observe?
  2. What might be causing these differences?
  3. How might these changes affect marine life?

## Threat Brainstorm
- In small groups, students brainstorm potential threats to marine ecosystems
- Groups share their ideas, creating a class list on the whiteboard
- Discuss which threats might be most relevant to Timor-Leste

# Main Lesson Activities

## Threat Impact Analysis
- Divide the class into five groups, each assigned a key threat:
  1. Overfishing
  2. Destructive fishing practices
  3. Coastal development
  4. Marine pollution
  5. Climate change
- Groups research their assigned threat and create a cause-and-effect diagram
- Present findings to the class, explaining the impact on marine ecosystems

## Virtual Reef Tour
- Use online resources or virtual reality tools to take students on a "tour" of a healthy coral reef
- Pause at different points to discuss how specific threats might impact various aspects of the reef ecosystem

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Case Study Analysis
- Divide class into small groups
- Distribute case studies of local environmental issues (e.g., coral reef damage, mangrove deforestation)
- Groups analyze their case study, identifying:
  - The main threat(s) to the ecosystem
  - Causes of the threat(s)
  - Current and potential impacts on the ecosystem and local communities
- Groups prepare and deliver short presentations on their findings

## Solution Brainstorming
- In pairs, students choose one threat to marine ecosystems
- Brainstorm potential solutions, considering:
  - Local community involvement
  - Government policies
  - Individual actions
  - Technological innovations
- Share ideas with the class and discuss feasibility

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Threat-Solution Matching
- Provide a list of marine threats and potential solutions
- Students match each threat with the most appropriate solution(s)
- Discuss answers as a class, exploring why certain solutions may be more effective for specific threats

## Ecosystem Impact Assessment
- Students choose a specific marine species or habitat in Timor-Leste
- Write a short essay describing how different threats might impact their chosen subject
- Include potential cascading effects on the broader ecosystem

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Mind Mapping
- Create a class mind map on the whiteboard summarizing:
  - Main threats to Timor-Leste's marine ecosystems
  - Causes of these threats
  - Potential solutions
  - Connections between different threats and solutions

## Reflection and Commitment
- Students write a brief reflection on:
  1. The most surprising thing they learned about marine ecosystem threats
  2. One action they can personally take to help protect Timor-Leste's marine environment
- Share reflections in small groups or with the whole class

## Marine Protection Pledge
- As a class, create a "Marine Protection Pledge" listing actions students can take to help protect local marine ecosystems
- Students sign the pledge and receive a copy to take home as a reminder of their commitment
