# Warm-up Activities

## Marine Ecosystem Comparison
- Display images of healthy and degraded marine ecosystems in Timor-Leste
- Students discuss in pairs:
  1. What differences do you notice between these ecosystems?
  2. What might have caused these differences?
  3. How could we prevent or reverse the degradation?
- Share responses as a class

## Conservation Strategy Brainstorm
- In small groups, students have 3 minutes to list as many marine conservation strategies as they can think of
- Groups share their lists, and the teacher compiles a master list on the board
- Briefly discuss any unfamiliar strategies

# Main Lesson Activities

## MPA Jigsaw
- Divide class into "expert groups" to research different aspects of MPAs:
  1. Definition and types of MPAs
  2. Benefits of MPAs
  3. Challenges in implementing MPAs
  4. Examples of successful MPAs in Timor-Leste or similar countries
- Experts then form new groups to share their knowledge

## Community Conservation Case Studies
- Provide short case studies of community-based conservation initiatives in Timor-Leste
- Students analyze the case studies, identifying:
  1. Key stakeholders involved
  2. Conservation strategies used
  3. Challenges faced
  4. Outcomes and lessons learned

## Policy Puzzle
- Create a matching game with national and international conservation policies and their descriptions
- Students work in pairs to match the policies to their correct descriptions
- Discuss the relevance of each policy to Timor-Leste's marine conservation efforts

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## MPA Design Challenge
- In small groups, students design a hypothetical marine protected area for a given coastal site in Timor-Leste
- Provide maps, species information, and local community data
- Groups present their MPA designs to the class, explaining their rationale

## Conservation Strategy Debate Prep
- Divide the class into teams to prepare arguments for a debate on the effectiveness of different conservation strategies
- Teams research and develop arguments for their assigned strategy (e.g., MPAs, community-based initiatives, national policies)
- Conduct a class debate, with teams presenting their arguments and responding to counterarguments

## Stakeholder Role Play
- Assign students roles as different stakeholders in a marine conservation scenario (e.g., fishers, tourism operators, conservationists, government officials)
- Groups discuss a proposed conservation initiative from their stakeholders' perspectives
- Attempt to reach a consensus on how to implement the initiative

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Conservation Strategy Comparison Chart
- Students create a chart comparing three different conservation strategies
- For each strategy, they list pros, cons, and potential applications in Timor-Leste
- Students write a short reflection on which strategy they believe is most promising for Timor-Leste and why

## MPA Zone Design
- Provide students with a map of a coastal area and information about local marine species and habitats
- Students individually design zones for an MPA, including no-take areas and sustainable use zones
- They write a brief explanation of their design choices

## Policy Analysis
- Students choose one national or international conservation policy relevant to Timor-Leste
- They research the policy and write a short report on:
  1. The policy's main objectives
  2. How it is implemented in Timor-Leste
  3. Its effectiveness and challenges
  4. Suggestions for improvement

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Conservation Strategy Gallery Walk
- Students create posters summarizing different conservation strategies discussed in the lesson
- Posters are displayed around the room
- Students walk around, viewing the posters and leaving comments or questions on sticky notes

## Reflection Journaling
- Students spend 5 minutes writing in their journals, reflecting on:
  1. One new thing they learned about marine conservation in Timor-Leste
  2. One question they still have
  3. How they might apply what they learned to help conserve local marine ecosystems

## Conservation Commitment Cards
- Provide small cards to each student
- Students write one specific action they commit to taking to support marine conservation in Timor-Leste
- Cards are collected and displayed on a class "Conservation Commitment" board

## Quick Quiz
- Conduct a brief quiz using an online platform or hand signals to review key concepts from the lesson
- Discuss any questions that many students found challenging
