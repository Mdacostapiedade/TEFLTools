# Warm-up Activities

## Marine Ecosystem Charades
- Divide students into small groups

- Discuss potential tourist activities for each ecosystem after it's guessed

## Photo Interpretation
- Display a series of photos showing marine ecosystems in Timor-Leste
- Students write down three potential tourist activities for each photo
- Share ideas and discuss potential environmental impacts

# Main Lesson Activities

## Ecotourism Concept Map
- Students create a concept map linking key terms: ecotourism, sustainable development, conservation, community involvement, and economic benefits
- Share and discuss maps to reinforce connections between concepts

- Students take notes on sustainable practices observed and areas for improvement
- Discuss observations as a class

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Stakeholder Role Play

- Compile a master class checklist based on best ideas

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Case Study Analysis
- Provide students with a written case study of a marine ecotourism project

- Write a short reflection on how principles from the case study could be applied in Timor-Leste

## Ecotourism Activity Design
- Each student designs one sustainable marine ecotourism activity for a specific site in Timor-Leste
- Include description, target audience, conservation goals, and potential challenges
- Students peer review each other's activities and provide constructive feedback

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Ecotourism Elevator Pitch
- Students have 60 seconds to pitch their ecotourism activity idea to the class
- Class votes on most innovative and sustainable ideas

## Reflection Web

- Students add key takeaways, questions, or ideas to the web
- Discuss common themes and lingering questions as a class

## One-Minute Paper
