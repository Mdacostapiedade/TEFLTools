# Warm-up Activities

## Space Image Interpretation
- Display a series of images taken by space telescopes (e.g., Hubble, James Webb)
- Ask students to describe what they see and speculate on what information astronomers might gain from each image
- Encourage creative thinking and discussion about the vastness of space

## "What's in the Sky?" Brainstorm
- Divide the class into small groups
- Each group lists as many objects they can think of that are visible in the night sky
- Groups share their lists, discussing which objects might be difficult to observe from Earth and why

# Main Lesson Activities

## Space Telescope Timeline
- Create a large timeline on the classroom wall
- Provide students with cards featuring different space telescopes and their launch dates
- Students place the cards on the timeline and share a key fact about each telescope

## Atmospheric Interference Demonstration
- Use a clear container filled with water to represent Earth's atmosphere
- Shine a flashlight through the water onto a target (representing a celestial object)
- Add drops of milk to the water to demonstrate how particles in the atmosphere scatter light
- Discuss how this affects ground-based observations

## Electromagnetic Spectrum Exploration
- Set up stations around the classroom, each representing a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum
- At each station, provide information about that part of the spectrum and examples of space telescopes that observe in that range
- Students rotate through stations, completing a worksheet about each type of radiation and its importance in astronomy

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Space Telescope Design Challenge
- In pairs or small groups, students design their own space telescope
- Provide materials such as cardboard tubes, lenses, mirrors, and craft supplies
- Groups present their designs, explaining the telescope's purpose and unique features

## Advantages of Space-Based Astronomy Debate
- Divide the class into two groups: one representing ground-based astronomy, the other space-based
- Each group researches and presents arguments for why their method is superior
- Conduct a structured debate, encouraging critical thinking and respectful discussion

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Space Telescope Fact Sheet
- Students choose one major space telescope to research
- They create a one-page fact sheet including:
  - Launch date and mission duration
  - Key discoveries
  - Technical specifications
  - A diagram or image of the telescope

## Atmospheric Interference Essay
- Students write a short essay explaining how Earth's atmosphere affects astronomical observations
- They should include at least three specific examples of interference and how space-based telescopes overcome these challenges

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Space Astronomy Quiz Show
- Divide the class into teams
- Ask questions based on the lesson content in a game show format
- Award points for correct answers and explanations

## Future of Space Astronomy Reflection
- Students write a brief reflection on what they think the future of space-based astronomy might look like
- Encourage them to consider potential technological advancements and new areas of research
- Share some responses with the class and discuss the possibilities

## "One Thing I Learned" Exit Ticket
- As students leave, ask them to share one new thing they learned about space-based astronomy
- Write these on the board to create a collective summary of the lesson's key points
