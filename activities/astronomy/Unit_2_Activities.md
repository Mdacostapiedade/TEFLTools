# Warm-up Activities

## Invisible Light Brainstorm (5 minutes)
- Students call out types of "invisible light" they've heard of (e.g., ultraviolet, infrared, X-rays)
- Teacher writes responses on the board
- Briefly discuss where students have encountered these terms before

## Wave Properties Demonstration (5 minutes)
- Use a long rope or slinky to demonstrate wave properties
- Show how wavelength and frequency are related
- Have students create waves with different frequencies

# Main Lesson Activities

## Electromagnetic Spectrum Exploration (15 minutes)
- Display a large diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum
- Explain each region, its properties, and common sources
- Use colored paper strips to represent different wavelengths
- Have students arrange the strips in order from longest to shortest wavelength

## Atmospheric Opacity Experiment (10 minutes)
- Set up stations with different materials (clear plastic, tinted plastic, cardboard)
- Use a flashlight to demonstrate how different materials block or allow light to pass
- Relate this to how Earth's atmosphere affects different wavelengths

## Prism Light Splitting Demonstration (10 minutes)
- Use a prism and flashlight to split white light into its component colors
- Explain how this relates to the visible light spectrum
- Discuss how astronomers use spectroscopy to study celestial objects

# Group Work Tasks

## Electromagnetic Region Poster Creation (20 minutes)
- Divide class into small groups, assign each a region of the EM spectrum
- Groups create posters explaining their region, including:
  - Wavelength range
  - Common sources
  - Uses in astronomy
  - Any special properties
- Groups present their posters to the class

## Space Telescope Research (15 minutes)
- In pairs, students research different types of space telescopes (e.g., radio, X-ray, gamma-ray)
- Each pair creates a brief presentation on their telescope type, explaining:
  - What part of the EM spectrum it observes
  - Why it needs to be in space
  - One major discovery made by this type of telescope

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Spectrum Labeling (10 minutes)
- Provide students with blank electromagnetic spectrum diagrams
- Students label major regions and wavelengths
- Include a few questions about atmospheric opacity and space-based observations

## Wavelength-Frequency Calculation Practice (10 minutes)
- Give students a worksheet with problems converting between wavelength and frequency
- Include questions about how these properties relate to energy

# Cool-down Activities

## EM Spectrum Quick Quiz (5 minutes)
- Teacher states a type of electromagnetic radiation
- Students point to its location on a spectrum diagram
- Discuss any misconceptions or confusion

## One-Minute Paper (5 minutes)
- Students write a brief response to:
  1. What was the most interesting thing you learned today?
  2. What question do you still have about the electromagnetic spectrum?
- Collect papers to assess understanding and plan future lessons

## Spectrum Charades (if time allows, 5-10 minutes)
- Students act out uses or sources of different types of electromagnetic radiation
- Class guesses which part of the spectrum is being represented
