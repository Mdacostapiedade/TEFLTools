# Warm-up Activities

## Space Telescope Guessing Game
1. Display images of various space telescopes without labels
2. Students work in pairs to guess the name and type of each telescope
3. Award points for correct answers and discuss unique features of each

## "I Spy" in Space
1. Show a complex image from a space telescope (e.g., Hubble Deep Field)
2. Students take turns describing objects they see in the image
3. Others try to locate the described objects

# Main Lesson Activities

## Space Telescope Virtual Tour
1. Use a virtual reality app or 360-degree video to explore a space telescope
2. Students note key components and technologies they observe
3. Discuss the challenges of operating such instruments in space

## Electromagnetic Spectrum Demonstration
1. Use a prism to split white light into its spectrum
2. Explain how different types of telescopes detect various parts of the spectrum
3. Students match different astronomical objects to the type of telescope best suited to observe them

# Group Work Tasks

## Space Telescope Design Challenge
1. Divide class into small groups
2. Each group designs a space telescope for a specific purpose (e.g., exoplanet detection, black hole observation)
3. Groups present their designs, explaining key features and technologies used

## Space-Based vs. Ground-Based Debate
