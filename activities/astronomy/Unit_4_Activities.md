# Warm-up Activities

## Solar System Scavenger Hunt
1. Display a large image of the solar system on the projector.
2. Give students 2 minutes to write down as many objects they can identify in the image.
3. Have students share their lists with a partner, adding any items they missed.
4. As a class, create a master list on the whiteboard, discussing any interesting or lesser-known objects.

## Space Mission Trivia
1. Divide the class into small teams.
2. Ask a series of quick-fire questions about famous space missions (e.g., "Which mission first landed humans on the Moon?").
3. Teams earn points for correct answers.
4. Briefly discuss interesting facts about each mission mentioned.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Virtual Planetary Tour
1. Use an online solar system simulator to take students on a virtual tour of the planets.
2. For each planet, highlight key discoveries made by space missions.
3. Encourage students to take notes on interesting facts or features.

## Exoplanet Detection Methods Demonstration
1. Use simple props (e.g., flashlight for star, small ball for planet) to demonstrate the transit method.
2. Show a video animation of the radial velocity method.
3. Discuss the advantages and limitations of each method.

## Space Telescope Gallery Walk
1. Set up stations around the classroom with information and images from different space telescopes (e.g., Hubble, James Webb, Kepler).
2. Have students rotate through the stations, recording key information about each telescope's capabilities and discoveries.

# Group Work Tasks

## Mars Rover Image Analysis
1. Divide students into small groups.
2. Provide each group with a set of recent images from Mars rovers.
3. Ask groups to analyze the images, identifying interesting features or potential signs of past water activity.
4. Have groups present their findings to the class, supporting their observations with evidence from the images.

## Exoplanet Detection Method Debate
1. Assign each group either the transit method or radial velocity method.
2. Give groups time to research and prepare arguments for why their assigned method is superior for exoplanet detection.
3. Conduct a structured debate, with groups presenting their arguments and responding to counterarguments.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Exoplanet Detection Diagram
1. Students create a detailed diagram illustrating either the transit method or radial velocity method of exoplanet detection.
2. Diagrams should include labels, a step-by-step explanation of the process, and advantages/disadvantages of the method.

## Space Mission Proposal
1. Students design a hypothetical space mission to explore a specific object in the solar system.
2. Proposals should include the mission objective, target object, proposed instruments, and expected scientific outcomes.

# Cool-down Activities

## Solar System News Flash
1. In pairs, students create a brief "news report" about a recent discovery from a space mission.
2. Reports should be 30-60 seconds long and cover key points: what was discovered, by which mission, and why it's significant.
3. Several pairs present their news flashes to the class.

## Cosmic Reflection
1. Students write a short reflection (2-3 sentences) on the most surprising or interesting thing they learned during the lesson.
2. Volunteers share their reflections with the class.
3. Discuss how these new insights change or expand our understanding of the solar system and beyond.
