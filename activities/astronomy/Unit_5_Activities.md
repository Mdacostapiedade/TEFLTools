# Warm-up Activities

## Star Gazing Simulation
- Display an image of the night sky on the projector
- Have students take turns pointing out and naming celestial objects they recognize
- Discuss the differences between stars, planets, and galaxies as a class

## Stellar Vocabulary Charades
- Divide students into small groups
- Give each group a set of cards with key stellar vocabulary terms
- Students take turns acting out the terms while their group members guess

# Main Lesson Activities

## Stellar Life Cycle Timeline
- Provide students with a blank timeline and cards representing different stages of stellar evolution
- Students arrange the cards in the correct order on the timeline
- Discuss as a class, explaining each stage and its characteristics

## Galactic Structure Puzzle
- Create a large puzzle of the Milky Way galaxy structure
- Each piece represents a different component (e.g., spiral arms, galactic center, halo)
- Students work together to assemble the puzzle while discussing the function of each component

# Group Work Tasks

## Hubble Image Analysis
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a different Hubble Space Telescope image of a star-forming region
- Groups analyze their image, identifying key features and presenting their findings to the class

## Milky Way Model Creation
- Assign each group a specific component of the Milky Way (e.g., galactic center, spiral arms, halo)
- Groups use provided materials to create a 3D model of their assigned component
- Combine all components to form a complete model of the galaxy

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Stellar Evolution Flowchart
- Students create a detailed flowchart showing the life cycle of a star
- Include branching paths for different stellar masses and their eventual fates

## Galactic Scavenger Hunt
- Provide students with a list of Milky Way features and characteristics
- Students research and find an image or fact about each item on the list

# Cool-down Activities

## Stellar Quiz Show
- Divide the class into teams
- Ask rapid-fire questions about stellar evolution and galactic structure
- Award points for correct answers and discuss any misconceptions

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write a brief summary of the most important thing they learned in the lesson
- Share a few responses with the class and address any remaining questions or confusion

## Stellar Storytelling
- Students create a short story or comic strip personifying a star and its journey through its life cycle
- Volunteers share their stories with the class
