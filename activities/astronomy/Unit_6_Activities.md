# Warm-up Activities

## Universe in a Minute
- Students have 60 seconds to write down everything they know about the universe's origins
- Pair up and compare lists, adding new ideas from their partner
- Share interesting or unique ideas with the class

## Cosmic Scale Timeline
- Create a physical timeline across the classroom representing the age of the universe
- Students place key events (e.g., formation of Earth, dinosaurs, human civilization) on the timeline
- Discuss the vast scale of cosmic time compared to human history

# Main Lesson Activities

## Balloon Universe Demonstration
- Inflate a balloon with dots drawn on it to represent galaxies
- Students observe how "galaxies" move apart as the balloon expands
- Discuss how this models the expanding universe concept

## CMB Detective
- Provide students with printouts of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data
- Guide them through interpreting temperature fluctuations
- Discuss what this tells us about the early universe

## Dark Matter Gravity Well
- Use a large elastic sheet and various sized balls to demonstrate gravitational effects
- Show how "invisible" masses (representing dark matter) affect the motion of visible objects

# Group Work Tasks

## Universe Timeline Poster
- Divide class into groups of 3-4
- Each group creates a poster showing major events in cosmic history
- Include: Big Bang, formation of first atoms, first stars and galaxies, present day
- Groups present their timelines to the class

## Evidence Debate
- Assign each group a piece of evidence for the Big Bang theory
- Groups research their evidence and prepare arguments for its significance
- Hold a class debate on which evidence is most compelling

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Redshift Calculator
- Provide students with spectral data from distant galaxies
- Students calculate the redshift and estimate the galaxy's velocity and distance
- Compare results and discuss implications for the expanding universe

## Cosmic Abundance Puzzle
- Give students a list of elements and their cosmic abundances
- Students match abundances to elements based on Big Bang nucleosynthesis predictions
- Discuss how this supports the Big Bang theory

# Cool-down Activities

## Cosmic Concept Map
- Students create individual concept maps linking key terms from the lesson
- Terms include: Big Bang, CMB, dark matter, dark energy, redshift, expansion
- Share and compare maps with a partner

## Future Universe Postcard
- Students imagine and illustrate the far future of the universe on a postcard
- Write a brief message explaining the scene based on current cosmological theories
- Gallery walk to view and discuss classmates' postcards
