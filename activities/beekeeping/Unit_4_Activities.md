Here's a set of engaging activities for the lesson on Creating Bee-Friendly Landscapes, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Creating Bee-Friendly Landscapes

## Warm-up Activities

1. **Bee-Friendly Plant Sorting**
   - Divide students into small groups
   - Provide each group with a set of plant pictures (mix of native and non-native species)
   - Ask groups to sort plants into "Bee-Friendly" and "Not Bee-Friendly" categories
   - Discuss results as a class, noting any misconceptions to address later

2. **Pollinator Charades**
   - Students act out different pollinators (bees, butterflies, hummingbirds)
   - Others guess the pollinator and name a plant it might visit

## Main Lesson Activities

1. **Native Plant Scavenger Hunt**
   - Take students on a short walk around the training site
   - Challenge them to identify and photograph as many native bee-friendly plants as possible
   - Discuss findings and characteristics that make these plants attractive to bees

2. **Permaculture Design Principles Jigsaw**
   - Divide students into "expert" groups, each assigned a permaculture principle
   - Groups research and become experts on their principle
   - Regroup students so each new group has one expert from each principle
   - Students teach each other about their assigned principles

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

1. **Bee Garden Design Challenge**
   - In pairs or small groups, provide students with a hypothetical garden space
   - Ask them to design a bee-friendly garden applying permaculture principles
   - Groups present their designs to the class, explaining their choices

2. **Year-Round Bee Buffet Planning**
   - In groups, create a planting schedule to ensure year-round bee forage
   - Provide blank yearly calendars and information on local plant flowering times
   - Groups share their calendars, discussing strategies for continuous nectar flow

## Individual Practice Exercises

1. **Plant Profile Creation**
   - Each student selects a native bee-friendly plant
   - Create a detailed profile including:
     * Plant name (common and scientific)
     * Flowering period
     * Nectar and pollen production
     * Growing requirements
     * Traditional uses in Timor-Leste

2. **Bee-Friendly Garden Sketch**
   - Students individually sketch a small bee-friendly garden design
   - Include water sources, nesting areas, and a variety of plants
   - Label each element and explain its purpose in supporting bees

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

1. **Bee-Friendly Landscape Bingo**
   - Create bingo cards with bee-friendly landscape features
   - Call out features, students mark their cards
   - First to get "bingo" explains why each marked feature is important for bees

2. **One Thing I Learned, One Question I Have**
   - Students write on sticky notes:
     * One new thing they learned about creating bee-friendly landscapes
     * One question they still have
   - Share in pairs, then select a few to discuss as a class

3. **Pollinator Pledge**
   - Students write a personal pledge to create or improve a bee-friendly space
   - Share pledges in small groups for accountability and inspiration

These activities are designed to reinforce key concepts from the lesson on Creating Bee-Friendly Landscapes while engaging students through varied, interactive learning experiences.
