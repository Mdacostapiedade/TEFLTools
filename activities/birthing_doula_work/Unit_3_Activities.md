# Warm-up Activities

## Labor and Birth Timeline
- Provide students with cards containing different events in the labor and birth process
- Ask them to work in pairs to arrange the cards in chronological order
- Discuss the correct order as a class, addressing any misconceptions

## Birth Story Sharing
- In small groups, have students share a birth story they've heard (personal or from others)
- Ask each group to identify common themes or experiences in the stories shared

# Main Lesson Activities

## Stages of Labor Jigsaw
- Divide the class into four groups, each assigned a stage of labor (early labor, active labor, transition, pushing)
- Each group researches their assigned stage and creates a poster with key information
- Groups then present their posters to the class, creating a comprehensive overview of the labor process

## Hormones in Labor Role-Play
- Assign students roles representing different hormones (oxytocin, endorphins, adrenaline)
- Have them act out how these hormones interact and influence the labor process
- Discuss the importance of creating an environment that supports positive hormonal interactions

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Comfort Measures Stations
- Set up stations around the room with different comfort measures (massage, breathing techniques, position changes)
- In pairs, have students rotate through the stations, practicing each technique
- Discuss how these measures can be applied during different stages of labor

## Case Study Analysis
- Provide small groups with different case studies of labor scenarios
- Ask them to identify the stage of labor, potential challenges, and appropriate support techniques
- Have groups present their findings to the class for discussion

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Labor Progress Journal
- Give students a template for a labor progress journal
- Have them fill it out based on a fictional labor scenario, noting contractions, dilation, and other relevant information
- Review entries individually to ensure understanding of labor progression

## Fetal Position Sketching
- Provide students with blank outlines of a pelvis
- Ask them to sketch different fetal positions (e.g., occiput anterior, posterior)
- Have them write brief explanations of how each position might affect labor

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Labor and Birth Bingo
- Create bingo cards with terms related to labor and birth
- Call out definitions or descriptions, having students mark off the corresponding terms
- Discuss any terms that were challenging or unfamiliar

## Reflection Circle
- Form a circle and pass around a "talking stick"
- Each student shares one new thing they learned about labor and birth, and one question they still have
- Address remaining questions as a group or note them for future lessons
