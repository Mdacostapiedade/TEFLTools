# Warm-up Activities

## Tree Shape Charades
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group receives a card with a tree shape (e.g., weeping willow, palm tree, bonsai style)
- Groups take turns acting out their tree shape without speaking
- Other students guess the shape

## Nature's Influence Gallery Walk
- Display images of trees shaped by natural forces around the room
- Students walk around with sticky notes, writing observations on how nature has influenced each tree's shape
- Discuss findings as a class

# Main Lesson Activities

## Bonsai Style Jigsaw
- Divide class into expert groups, each assigned a different bonsai style
- Groups research their style and create a visual presentation
- Regroup students so each new group has an expert on each style
- Experts teach their style to the new group

## Aesthetic Principles Scavenger Hunt
- Create stations around the room, each focusing on a different aesthetic principle
- Students rotate through stations, completing a task related to each principle (e.g., sketching a balanced composition, identifying asymmetry in photos)

## Local Species Adaptation Challenge
- Provide images or specimens of local Timorese tree species
- Students work in pairs to propose how each species could be adapted to a bonsai style
- Pairs present their ideas to the class for feedback

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Style Masters
- Assign each group a bonsai style
- Groups create a poster or digital presentation explaining:
  * Key characteristics of the style
  * Best species for this style
  * Challenges in creating and maintaining this style
- Groups present to the class

## Bonsai Design Consultants
- In pairs, students take turns being the "client" and the "consultant"
- The client describes a space where they want to display a bonsai
- The consultant recommends a style and species, explaining their reasoning

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Sketch-a-Style
- Provide students with a template of a basic tree outline
- Students modify the template to represent different bonsai styles
- Add notes explaining key features of each style

## Aesthetic Principle Application
- Students choose a local Timorese tree species
- Create a sketch applying at least three aesthetic principles learned in class
- Write a brief explanation of how each principle was incorporated

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Bonsai Style Bingo
- Create bingo cards with bonsai styles and aesthetic principles
- Call out definitions or show images
- Students mark their cards when they recognize the style or principle
- First to get bingo wins

## Reflection Haiku

  * Their favorite bonsai style
  * How bonsai reflects nature
  * The connection between bonsai and Timorese culture

## One-Minute Expert
- Each student has one minute to explain a bonsai style or aesthetic principle to a partner
- Partners provide feedback on clarity and accuracy
- Switch roles and repeat with a different topic
