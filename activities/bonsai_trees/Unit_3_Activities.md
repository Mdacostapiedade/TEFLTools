# Warm-up Activities

## Tree Characteristics Bingo
1. Create bingo cards with various tree characteristics (e.g., "thick trunk", "exposed roots", "twisted branches").
2. Show images of Timorese trees, and have students mark off characteristics they see.
3. First to get a line calls "Bonsai!" and explains why those features are desirable for bonsai.

## Rapid Sketching
1. Display images of Timorese trees for 30 seconds each.
2. Students quickly sketch the most prominent features they notice.
3. Discuss how these features could translate to bonsai styling.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Species Showcase
1. Present a slideshow of native Timorese species suitable for bonsai.
2. For each species, highlight key characteristics and potential bonsai styles.
3. Students take notes on a provided species guide template.

## Yamadori Collection Simulation
1. Set up an indoor or outdoor area with fake "wild" trees (potted plants).
2. Demonstrate the proper technique for assessing and collecting yamadori.
3. Students practice the collection process, focusing on minimal environmental impact.

## Nursery Stock Selection Challenge
1. Provide several nursery plants of varying quality for bonsai potential.
2. Students evaluate each plant based on trunk, roots, and branch structure.
3. Groups present their top choice, explaining their reasoning to the class.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Ethical Collection Debate
1. Divide the class into pairs or small groups.
2. Assign each group a scenario related to yamadori collection (e.g., rare species, protected area).
3. Groups debate the ethical considerations and present their conclusions to the class.

## Species Adaptation Workshop
1. Assign each group a different Timorese tree species.
2. Groups research and discuss how to adapt traditional bonsai styles to their species.
3. Create a poster showcasing potential bonsai styles for their assigned species.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Pre-Bonsai Potting
1. Provide each student with a small tree or shrub, bonsai pot, and necessary tools.
2. Guide students through the process of preparing and potting their pre-bonsai specimen.
3. Students document each step with photos or sketches for future reference.

## Bonsai Potential Assessment
1. Give students a worksheet with images of various trees and shrubs.
2. Students rate each plant's bonsai potential and explain their reasoning.
3. Include a mix of ideal candidates and less suitable options to challenge critical thinking.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Species Matching Game
1. Create cards with Timorese tree species names and their key characteristics.
2. Students work in pairs to match species names with their descriptions.
3. Review answers as a class, clarifying any misunderstandings.

## Bonsai Vision Board
1. Provide magazines, local nature photos, and art supplies.
2. Students create a collage representing their vision for a Timorese-inspired bonsai.
3. Share vision boards and discuss how they incorporate local species and cultural elements.

## Reflection Circle
1. Form a circle with the class.
2. Pass around a small potted plant or bonsai tool.
3. When holding the item, each student shares one new thing they learned and one question they still have about bonsai material selection.
