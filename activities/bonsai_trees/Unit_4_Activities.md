# Warm-up Activities

## Bonsai Shape Matching Game
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a set of bonsai style cards and tree silhouette cards
- Have students match the style names to the correct silhouettes
- Discuss the matches as a class, highlighting key features of each style

## Pruning Visualization
- Show students a photograph of an unpruned tree
- Ask them to sketch how they would prune it to create a bonsai shape
- Share and compare sketches, discussing different approaches

# Main Lesson Activities

## Pruning Demonstration and Practice
- Instructor demonstrates proper pruning techniques on a demo tree
- Students practice on their own trees, receiving guidance and feedback
- Focus on both structural and maintenance pruning

## Wiring Technique Stations
- Set up stations with different branch shapes and thicknesses
- Students rotate through stations, practicing wiring techniques
- Include a station for wire removal to emphasize the importance of preventing damage

## Repotting Simulation
- Provide students with potted plants (non-bonsai) and empty bonsai pots
- Guide them through the repotting process, including root pruning
- Emphasize proper soil mixture and placement techniques

# Group Work Tasks

## Bonsai Design Challenge
- In pairs, give students a "before" picture of a pre-bonsai tree
- Ask them to create a styling plan, including pruning and wiring decisions
- Have pairs present their plans to another group for feedback

## Troubleshooting Scenarios
- Create cards with common bonsai problems (e.g., wire scarring, overwatering)
- Groups draw cards and discuss how to address each issue
- Share solutions with the class, encouraging multiple perspectives

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Bonsai Journal
- Provide students with a template for a bonsai care journal
- Have them start entries for their trees, including current state and future plans
- Encourage sketches, notes on pruning, and maintenance schedules

## Wire Application Practice
- Give each student a set of fake branches or dowels
- Have them practice applying wire at different angles and tensions
- Provide individual feedback on technique and branch placement

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## Bonsai Pictionary
- Divide class into teams
- One member from each team draws a bonsai technique or tool while their team guesses
- Review any terms or concepts that were challenging to draw or guess

## Reflection Circle
- Form a circle with the class
- Pass around a small bonsai tree
- Each student shares one new thing they learned or a technique they want to practice more

## Future Vision Sharing
- Have students briefly describe how they envision their bonsai in 5 years
- Discuss the long-term nature of bonsai cultivation and the importance of patience
