# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Deadwood Detective

- Display images of ancient trees with natural deadwood features.
- In pairs, students play "Deadwood Detective," identifying and sketching deadwood elements they observe.
- Discuss how these features contribute to the tree's character and apparent age.

## 2. Vocabulary Matchup

- Create cards with key terms (jin, shari, leaf reduction, grafting, air layering) and their definitions.
- Students mingle, matching terms to definitions, then form groups to explain their matches to each other.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Deadwood Demonstration

- Instructor demonstrates jin and shari creation on a practice tree or branch.
- Students take notes and sketch the process, noting key steps and tools used.

## 2. Leaf Reduction Exploration

- Set up stations with before and after examples of leaf reduction techniques.
- Students rotate through stations, examining results and hypothesizing about methods used.

## 3. Grafting and Air Layering Visualization

- Use a multimedia presentation to show time-lapse videos of grafting and air layering processes.
- Pause at key points for students to predict next steps or potential outcomes.

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Deadwood Design Challenge

- In small groups, students receive a "tree profile" (species, age, style).
- Groups collaborate to design deadwood features appropriate for their tree, creating a sketch and written plan.

## 2. Leaf Reduction Strategy Session

- Assign each group a different species with large leaves.
- Groups research and develop a leaf reduction strategy, presenting their plan to the class.

## 3. Technique Rotation Stations

- Set up stations for jin creation, shari creation, and air layering.
- Groups rotate through stations, practicing techniques and providing peer feedback.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Jin Creation Practice

- Provide each student with a small branch to practice jin creation.
- Students follow a step-by-step guide, documenting their process with photos.

## 2. Bonsai Styling Plan

- Students select a pre-bonsai tree or photo.
- They create a detailed styling plan incorporating at least one advanced technique learned in the lesson.

## 3. Leaf Reduction Journal

- Students start a leaf reduction journal for a tree they're working on.
- They document initial leaf size, planned reduction techniques, and projected timeline.

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Technique Charades

- Write advanced techniques on slips of paper.
- Students draw a slip and silently act out the technique for others to guess.

## 2. Reflection Circle

- Form a circle and pass around a "talking stick."
- Each student shares one new technique they're excited to try and why.

## 3. Quick Quiz

- Project multiple-choice questions about the lesson content.
- Students answer using colored cards or a digital response system.

## 4. Bonsai Vision Board

- Students create a digital or physical collage representing their bonsai goals.
- Include images of desired styles, techniques they want to master, and inspiration trees.
