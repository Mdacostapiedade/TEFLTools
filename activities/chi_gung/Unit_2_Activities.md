# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Breath Awareness Circle
- Students stand in a circle
- Take three deep breaths together, focusing on the sound and rhythm
- On the third exhale, make a gentle "ahh" sound together

## 2. Body Scan Shake-out
- Start at the feet, gently shaking and loosening each body part
- Move up through legs, hips, torso, arms, and head
- End with a full-body shake for 10 seconds

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Belly vs. Chest Breathing Experiment
- Students place one hand on chest, one on belly
- Breathe normally for 30 seconds, observing which hand moves more
- Switch to intentional belly breathing for 30 seconds
- Discuss the differences in sensation and ease of breathing

## 2. Balloon Belly Visualization
- Students lie on mats or sit comfortably
- Imagine a balloon in the belly that inflates on inhale, deflates on exhale
- Practice for 2 minutes, focusing on smooth, even breaths

## 3. Breath Counting Challenge
- Students close eyes and count breaths silently for 2 minutes
- Raise a finger each time mind wanders, then return to counting
- Discuss challenges and strategies for maintaining focus

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Partner Breathing Observation
- In pairs, one partner observes the other's breathing for 1 minute
- Observer provides feedback on belly movement and overall relaxation
- Switch roles and repeat

## 2. Collaborative Breath Phrase Creation
- In small groups, create a short, calming phrase related to breathing
- Examples: "Breathe in peace, breathe out tension" or "With each breath, I relax"
- Share phrases with the class

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Personal Breath Rhythm Exploration
- Students experiment with different breath counts (e.g., 4-count inhale, 6-count exhale)
- Find a comfortable, personal rhythm
- Practice for 3 minutes

## 2. Mindful Movement Integration
- Students choose a simple, repetitive movement (e.g., arm raises, gentle twists)
- Coordinate the movement with their breath for 2 minutes
- Reflect on the experience in their notebook

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Gratitude Breathing
- Students think of something they're grateful for
- Inhale deeply, thinking of the gratitude
- Exhale slowly, sending out positive energy
- Repeat for 1-2 minutes

## 2. Group Energy Circle
- Stand in a circle, holding hands or with palms facing neighbors
- Take three synchronized breaths as a group
- On the final exhale, gently squeeze hands or move palms inward to "send" energy around the circle

## 3. Personal Reflection
- Students write one key takeaway and one question about Qigong breathing in their notebooks
- Voluntarily share with the class or keep for personal reference
