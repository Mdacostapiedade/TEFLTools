## 1. Flexibility Flow

- Guide students through a series of gentle stretches:
  1. Neck and shoulder rolls
  2. Standing side bends
  3. Forward folds with bent knees
  4. Seated spinal twists
- Emphasize breath awareness and finding a comfortable edge

## 2. Balance Progression

  2. Add arm movements (e.g., raising arms overhead)
  3. Progress to tree pose
  4. Challenge: Close eyes briefly while balancing

## 3. Breath-Centered Movement

  1. Inhale: Raise arms to shoulder height
  2. Exhale: Lower arms and sink slightly
  3. Inhale: Turn palms up and raise arms overhead
  4. Exhale: Lower arms and return to starting position
- Repeat 8-10 times, focusing on smooth, continuous movement

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Partner Balance Challenge

- In pairs, students create a sequence of 3-4 balance poses
- Encourage creativity and safe exploration
- Pairs demonstrate their sequence to another pair or small group

## 2. Flexibility Feedback Circle

- Form groups of 4-5 students
- Each student demonstrates a stretch they find challenging
- Group members offer gentle adjustments and encouragement

## 3. Breath Awareness Game

- In pairs, one partner performs a simple Qigong movement
- The other partner tries to match their breath to the movement
- Switch roles after 2-3 minutes

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Personal Flexibility Assessment

- Students identify 3 areas of tightness in their body
- Guide them to create a personalized stretch routine addressing these areas
- Practice the routine for 5-7 minutes

## 2. Balance Exploration

- Set up "balance stations" around the room (e.g., standing on one leg, heel-to-toe walking, tree pose)
- Students move through stations at their own pace, spending 1-2 minutes at each

## 3. Mindful Movement Sequence

- Teach a short sequence combining flexibility and balance elements
- Students practice independently, focusing on breath and body awareness
- Encourage them to adapt movements as needed

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Seated Meditation

- Guide students through a 5-minute seated meditation
- Focus on breath awareness and sensing the body's new state of flexibility and balance

## 2. Group Reflection Circle

- Sit in a circle and pass a small object (e.g., a stone)
- Each person shares one insight or feeling from the practice

## 3. Gentle Qigong Cool-down

- Lead a series of gentle, flowing movements to bring heart rate down and center the body
- Include slow arm circles, gentle twists, and light stretching
- End with 3 deep breaths together as a group
