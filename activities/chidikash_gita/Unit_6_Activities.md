# Warm-up Activities

## Compassion Circle
- Students stand in a circle and take turns sharing one act of kindness they've witnessed or performed recently.
- After each share, the group responds with a gentle bow and says, "May your compassion grow."

## Empathy Charades
- Students draw emotion cards and act them out without speaking.
- Others try to guess the emotion and describe how they might respond compassionately to someone feeling that way.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Compassion Spectrum
- Create a spectrum line across the room with "Easy to feel compassion for" on one end and "Difficult to feel compassion for" on the other.
- Call out different subjects (e.g., family member, stranger, enemy) and have students position themselves along the spectrum.
- Discuss why some subjects are easier or harder to feel compassion for.

## Loving-Kindness Visualization
- Guide students through a visualization where they imagine sending love and kindness to:
  1. Themselves
  2. A loved one
  3. A neutral person
  4. A difficult person
  5. All beings everywhere
- After each stage, students journal briefly about their experience.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Compassion Case Studies
- In small groups, students receive scenarios describing challenging situations.
- They discuss and present how to approach each situation with compassion.

## Cultural Compassion Collage
- Pairs research and create a collage showcasing compassionate practices from Timorese culture.
- They present their findings to the class, explaining the cultural significance.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Compassion Challenge
- Students identify one area in their life where they struggle to show compassion.
- They create a week-long plan to practice compassion in that specific area.

## Metta Mantra Creation
- Students compose their own personal loving-kindness mantra in Tetum.
- They practice reciting it silently while focusing on different recipients (self, others, all beings).

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Compassion Commitment
- Students write a personal commitment to practice compassion on a small card.
- They exchange cards with a partner who will check in with them next week.

## Gratitude Wave
