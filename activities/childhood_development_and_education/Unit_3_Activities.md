# Warm-up Activities

## 1. ECCD Memory Lane

- Students form a circle and take turns sharing a brief memory from their early childhood that positively impacted their development.
- After each share, the group identifies which aspect of development (physical, cognitive, social, emotional) the memory primarily relates to.

## 2. ECCD Pictionary

- Divide the class into small groups.
- Each group receives a key ECCD term to draw (e.g., nurturing care, holistic development).
- Groups take turns drawing their term while others guess, promoting engagement with key vocabulary.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Nurturing Care Framework Jigsaw

- Divide class into five groups, each assigned one component of WHO's Nurturing Care Framework.
- Groups become "experts" on their component, then reform into mixed groups to teach others.
- Create a visual representation of the framework as a class.

## 2. Cultural Adaptation Scenarios

- Present various ECCD interventions from around the world.
- Students discuss in pairs how each might be adapted for Timor-Leste, considering cultural norms and resources.
- Share adaptations with the class, discussing potential challenges and solutions.

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. ECCD Intervention Design Challenge

- In small groups, design an evidence-based ECCD program for a specific Timorese community (urban, rural, etc.).
- Groups must incorporate at least three evidence-based practices and address cultural considerations.
- Create a visual poster of the program design.

## 2. Case Study Analysis

- Assign each group a different ECCD intervention case study.
- Groups analyze the case study, identifying key elements of success and areas for improvement.
- Present findings to the class, focusing on applicability to Timor-Leste.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Reflection Journal

- Students write a reflective entry on how their understanding of ECCD has evolved during the lesson.
- Prompt: "How might evidence-based ECCD practices benefit children in your community?"

## 2. ECCD Resource Hunt

- Students individually research and compile a list of 5-10 evidence-based ECCD resources relevant to Timor-Leste.
- Create an annotated bibliography with brief descriptions of each resource.

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. ECCD Gallery Walk

- Display group ECCD program designs around the room.
- Students silently tour the "gallery," leaving post-it note feedback on each design.
- Conclude with a brief class discussion on common themes and innovative ideas.

## 2. One Word Checkout

- Students share one word that summarizes their main takeaway from the lesson.
- Create a word cloud on the board with all responses.
- Briefly discuss any patterns or surprising responses.

## 3. ECCD Commitment Cards

- Distribute index cards to students.
- Each student writes one action they commit to taking to support ECCD in their community.
- Cards are collected and will be redistributed at the start of the next class for follow-up.
