# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Development Detective

- In pairs, students take turns describing a child they know (without mentioning age) and their recent developmental achievements.
- Partner guesses the approximate age based on the description.
- Class discussion on the variety of developmental milestones observed.

## 2. Milestone Match-up

- Students receive cards with various developmental milestones.
- They move around the room, finding peers with milestones from the same age group.
- Groups present their findings, discussing any surprises or cultural variations.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Assessment Tool Exploration

- Small groups are assigned different assessment tools (e.g., Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Denver Developmental Screening Test).
- Groups research their tool and create a brief presentation on its purpose, method, and cultural considerations for Timor-Leste.
- Class Q&A follows each presentation.

## 2. Cultural Adaptation Workshop

- Present a Western assessment tool to the class.
- In groups, students identify potential cultural biases or irrelevant items.
- Groups propose modifications to make the tool more appropriate for Timor-Leste context.
- Class discussion on the importance of cultural sensitivity in assessments.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Mock Assessment Role-play

- In pairs, students take turns role-playing as an assessor and a child's caregiver.
- Using a simplified version of an assessment tool, they practice conducting an interview and recording responses.
- Partners provide feedback on communication style and cultural sensitivity.

## 2. Monitoring Plan Design Challenge

- In small groups, students are given a hypothetical ECCD program scenario in Timor-Leste.
- Groups collaborate to design a monitoring plan, including key indicators, data collection methods, and reporting frequency.
- Groups present their plans, and the class votes on the most comprehensive and culturally appropriate approach.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Case Study Analysis

- Students receive a case study of a child's development assessment results.
- They individually analyze the data, identify potential areas of concern, and suggest next steps.
- Students write a brief report summarizing their findings and recommendations.

## 2. Culturally Appropriate Milestone Checklist

- Students create a developmental milestone checklist for a specific age group (e.g., 3-5 years) that is culturally relevant to Timor-Leste.
- They research both standard milestones and local expectations to create a balanced tool.
- Students justify their choices in a short written explanation.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Reflection Journaling

- Students spend 5-10 minutes writing in a reflection journal about their key takeaways from the lesson.
- They consider how they might apply what they've learned in their future work with children in Timor-Leste.

## 2. Assessment Bingo

- Create a bingo card with key terms and concepts from the lesson.
- Read out definitions or descriptions, and students mark off the corresponding terms on their cards.
- First student to complete a line wins and explains the concepts in that line to the class.

## 3. One-Minute Expert

- Students pair up and take turns being the "expert" on a topic from the lesson.
- Each student has one minute to explain a concept (e.g., formative assessment, cultural adaptation of tools) to their partner.
- Partners provide feedback and clarification if needed.
