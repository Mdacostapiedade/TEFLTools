# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Spirit Circle

- Students stand in a circle and pass an object (e.g., a small stone) around.
- Each student holds the object and shares one word they associate with Timorese spirituality.
- Write these words on the board for reference during the lesson.

## 2. Ancestor Memory Game

- Students work in pairs to list as many objects as they can remember.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Animism Exploration

- Divide the class into small groups.
- Each group is assigned a natural element (e.g., tree, river, mountain).
- Groups discuss how this element might be viewed in animistic beliefs and create a short story or legend about its spirit.

## 2. Ritual Role-Play

- Assign different Timorese rituals to small groups (e.g., harvest ceremony, birth ritual).
- Groups research and prepare a brief role-play demonstrating the ritual.
- Each group performs for the class, followed by a discussion of the ritual's significance.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Ancestor Tree

- In pairs, students create a visual representation of their family tree, highlighting ancestors who play important roles in family traditions or stories.
- Pairs share their trees and discuss the role of ancestors in their families.

## 2. Sacred Space Design

- Small groups design a sacred space for a specific purpose (e.g., meditation, ancestor veneration).
- Groups draw their design on large paper, labeling each element and explaining its significance.
- Groups present their designs to the class.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Lulik Reflection
