# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Service Spectrum

- Create a line across the room with "Individual" on one end and "Community" on the other
- Ask students to stand along the line based on where they think various acts of service fall
- Read out examples: meditation, volunteering at a soup kitchen, donating money, teaching a skill, etc.
- Discuss why students chose their positions and how individual and community service can intersect

## 2. Spiritual Service Brainstorm

- In small groups, students have 2 minutes to list as many ways as possible that spiritual practice can lead to community service
- Groups share their lists, and the class compiles a master list on the whiteboard

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Spiritual Leaders and Service Gallery Walk

- Create posters around the room featuring spiritual leaders from various traditions who engaged in community service (e.g., Mother Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi, Thich Nhat Hanh)
- Students walk around, read about each leader, and note how their spiritual beliefs informed their service
- Class discussion on common themes and inspirations

## 2. Community Needs Mapping

- Using a large map of the local area, students place sticky notes to identify community needs they're aware of
- Discuss patterns that emerge and how these needs might be addressed through service projects

## 3. Stakeholder Role Play

- Assign students roles as different community stakeholders (e.g., elder, youth, business owner, religious leader)
