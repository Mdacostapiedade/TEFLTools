Here's a set of engaging activities for the lesson on Clean Cooking Technologies for Timor-Leste, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Clean Cooking Technologies Lesson

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### Cooking Method Charades
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group draws a card with a cooking method (traditional or clean)
- Groups act out the cooking method without speaking
- Other students guess the method being demonstrated

### Picture Puzzle
- Display a large image of a clean cooking technology, covered by removable pieces
- Remove pieces one by one, asking students to guess what the image represents
- Discuss their guesses and reveal the full image

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Technology Rotation Stations
- Set up stations around the room, each featuring a different clean cooking technology
- Students rotate through stations in small groups
- At each station, students read information, examine the technology, and answer guided questions

### Advantages/Limitations Jigsaw
- Assign each student a specific clean cooking technology
- Students with the same technology form expert groups to discuss advantages and limitations
- Regroup students so each new group has experts on different technologies
- Experts share their knowledge with their new group

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Community Case Study Analysis
- Provide groups with detailed case studies of communities in Timor-Leste
- Groups analyze the community's needs and resources
- They recommend a clean cooking solution and create a poster explaining their choice
- Groups present their recommendations to the class

### Debate: Technology Face-off
- Divide the class into three groups, each representing a clean cooking technology
- Groups prepare arguments for why their technology is the best solution for Timor-Leste
- Conduct a structured debate, with each group presenting arguments and rebuttals

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Technology Matching Quiz
- Provide a worksheet with descriptions of features, advantages, and limitations
- Students match each description to the correct clean cooking technology

### Reflection Journal
- Students write a personal reflection on how clean cooking technologies could impact their own families or communities
- They consider potential benefits and challenges of adoption

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### Clean Cooking Bingo
- Create bingo cards with key terms and concepts from the lesson
- Read out definitions or descriptions
- Students mark off the corresponding terms on their cards
- First student to complete a row wins

### One-Minute Paper
- In the last minute of class, students write down:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
- Collect papers to assess understanding and address remaining questions in the next lesson

### Technology Pros and Cons Snowball
- Students write one pro and one con for any clean cooking technology on a piece of paper
- They crumple the paper into a "snowball" and toss it across the room
- Each student picks up a snowball, reads it aloud, and briefly discusses the points

These activities are designed to be engaging, interactive, and reinforce the key concepts of clean cooking technologies. They cater to different learning styles and encourage active participation from all students.
