# Engaging Activities for Sustainable Practices in Coconut Farming and Processing

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Coconut Plantation Picture Analysis
- Display images of healthy and unhealthy coconut plantations
- Students work in pairs to identify differences and discuss potential causes
- Share observations with the class

### 2. Sustainable Farming Word Cloud
- Students brainstorm words related to sustainable farming
- Create a collaborative word cloud using an online tool
- Discuss the most prominent terms and their significance

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Organic Farming Jigsaw
- Divide class into expert groups, each focusing on one aspect of organic coconut farming
- Experts then form new groups to share their knowledge
- Each group creates a mind map summarizing organic farming practices

### 2. IPM Strategy Carousel
- Set up stations around the room, each with a different coconut pest or disease
- Groups rotate through stations, brainstorming IPM strategies for each problem
- Compile a class-wide IPM guide based on the best ideas

### 3. Energy-Efficient Processing Demo
- Demonstrate a small-scale, energy-efficient coconut oil extraction method
- Students take notes on the process and identify energy-saving techniques
- Discuss how these methods could be scaled up for larger operations

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Sustainable Farm Design Challenge
- In small groups, design a sustainable coconut farm layout
- Include elements such as intercropping, water conservation, and natural pest control
- Groups present their designs using large paper or digital tools

### 2. Pros and Cons Debate Prep
- Divide class into pairs, assigning each pair either organic or conventional farming
- Pairs research and list pros and cons of their assigned method
- Conduct a class debate on organic vs. conventional coconut farming

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Sustainable Practice Matching
- Create a worksheet with sustainable practices and their benefits
- Students match practices to their corresponding benefits
- Review answers as a class, discussing any misconceptions

### 2. IPM Strategy Development
- Provide students with a specific coconut pest scenario
- Individually, students develop a comprehensive IPM strategy
- Share strategies in small groups for peer feedback

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned
- Share responses with a partner or small group
- Collect papers to assess understanding and plan future lessons

### 2. Sustainable Practices Pledge
- Students create personal pledges to implement sustainable practices
- Write pledges on leaf-shaped paper and attach to a class "Sustainability Tree"
- Revisit pledges periodically to check progress and reinforce concepts

### 3. Coconut Sustainability Quiz
- Conduct a quick, interactive quiz using a tool like Kahoot! or Quizlet Live
- Focus on key concepts from the lesson
- Discuss any questions that proved challenging for the class
