# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Coconut Waste Brainstorm (10 minutes)
- Display various coconut waste products (husks, shells, fibers)
- Students work in pairs to brainstorm potential uses for these waste products
- Share ideas with the class and record them on the whiteboard

## 2. Circular Economy Pictionary (15 minutes)
- Divide the class into small groups
- Each group receives a card with a circular economy concept (e.g., upcycling, waste valorization)
- Groups take turns drawing their concept while others guess
- Discuss each concept briefly after it's guessed correctly

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Circular Economy Jigsaw (30 minutes)
- Divide students into "expert groups" to research different aspects of circular economy in coconut production:
  1. Coir fiber products
  2. Activated carbon production
  3. Biochar production
  4. Landscaping applications
- Students then form "teaching groups" with one expert from each topic to share their knowledge

## 2. Biochar Production Video Analysis (20 minutes)
- Show a video on biochar production from coconut waste
- Students take notes on the process, benefits, and applications
- Facilitate a class discussion on the potential impact of biochar in Timor-Leste agriculture

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Circular Economy Model Design (45 minutes)
- In groups of 3-4, students design a circular economy model for a Timorese coconut processing facility
- Create a visual representation including input materials, processes, outputs, and waste utilization strategies
- Present models to the class and discuss feasibility and potential impact

## 2. Coconut Waste Flow Diagram (20 minutes)
- In pairs, create a flow diagram showing how coconut waste can be transformed into valuable products
- Include at least three different waste streams and their potential uses
- Share diagrams with another pair and provide feedback

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Coconut Waste Upcycling Challenge (30 minutes)
- Provide each student with a piece of coconut waste (shell, husk, or fiber)
- Challenge them to design a useful product or artwork using the waste material
- Students sketch their designs and write a brief description of the product's purpose and target market

## 2. Circular Economy Concept Map (20 minutes)
- Students create individual concept maps linking circular economy principles to coconut waste valorization
- Include key terms, processes, and potential benefits
- Encourage creativity in visual representation

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Circular Economy Quiz Game (15 minutes)
- Divide the class into teams
- Ask rapid-fire questions about circular economy concepts and coconut waste utilization
- Award points for correct answers and discuss any misconceptions

## 2. Reflection and Action Planning (20 minutes)
- Students write a brief reflection on the most surprising or impactful concept they learned
- Individually, they create a personal action plan for implementing circular economy principles in their daily lives
- Share action plans in small groups and provide encouragement and suggestions
