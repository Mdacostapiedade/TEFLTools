# Warm-up Activities

## Coconut Product Brainstorm
1. Display various coconut products (oil, water, husks, shells) on a table.
2. Students form small groups and brainstorm potential environmental impacts (positive and negative) associated with each item.
3. Groups share their ideas with the class, and responses are recorded on the whiteboard.

## Coconut Industry Word Cloud
1. Use an online word cloud generator tool.
2. Students contribute words or phrases related to the coconut industry in Timor-Leste.
3. Display the resulting word cloud and briefly discuss the most prominent terms.

# Main Lesson Activities

## LCA Interactive Presentation
1. Create an interactive presentation on Life Cycle Assessment using a tool like Mentimeter.
2. Include quiz questions throughout the presentation to check understanding.
3. Students use their smartphones or laptops to participate and answer questions in real-time.

## Carbon Sequestration Demonstration
1. Use a simple physical model (e.g., sponges representing trees, colored water representing CO2) to demonstrate carbon sequestration.
2. Students take turns "planting" coconut trees (sponges) and observing how much "carbon" (colored water) they absorb.

## Economic Impact Role-Play
1. Assign students different roles in a coconut farming community (farmer, processor, exporter, etc.).
2. Provide scenario cards describing economic changes (e.g., price fluctuations, new regulations).
3. Students discuss how these changes would affect their assigned roles and the community as a whole.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Simplified LCA Exercise
1. Divide students into small groups.
2. Distribute simplified LCA templates and assign a coconut product to each group.
3. Groups work together to complete a basic LCA for their assigned product.
4. Each group presents their findings to the class.

## Coconut Farm Sustainability Plan
1. In pairs, students develop a sustainability plan for a hypothetical coconut farm in Timor-Leste.
2. Provide a template with sections on environmental, economic, and social sustainability.
3. Pairs share their plans with another pair for peer feedback.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Carbon Sequestration Calculation
1. Provide students with data on coconut palm growth rates and carbon storage capacity.
2. Students individually calculate the potential carbon sequestration of a small coconut plantation over 10 years.
3. Compare results and discuss variations in calculations.

## Economic Impact Analysis Essay
1. Students write a short essay (250-300 words) on the potential economic benefits and challenges of expanding coconut production in a specific region of Timor-Leste.
2. Encourage students to consider both short-term and long-term impacts.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## LCA and Economic Impact Jigsaw
1. Divide the class into "expert" groups focusing on either LCA or economic impacts.
2. Expert groups discuss and summarize key points from their topic.
3. Regroup students into mixed teams with members from both expert groups.
4. Students teach each other about their expert topics.

## Coconut Industry Future Scenarios
1. Present three possible future scenarios for the coconut industry in Timor-Leste (e.g., rapid growth, decline, sustainable development).
2. Students vote on which scenario they think is most likely and explain their reasoning.
3. Discuss the potential environmental and economic implications of each scenario.

## Reflection Postcards
1. Distribute blank postcards to students.
2. Students write a brief reflection on what they learned about the environmental and economic impacts of the coconut industry.
3. Collect the postcards and read a few aloud (anonymously) to reinforce key concepts.
