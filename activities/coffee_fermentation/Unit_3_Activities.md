# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Coffee Flavor Bingo

- Create bingo cards with various coffee flavor descriptors
- Provide students with small samples of different coffees
- Students taste and mark off flavors they detect
- First to get a line or full card wins

## 2. Fermentation Word Association

- Write "Fermentation" on the board
- Students take turns adding associated words or concepts
- Discuss the connections between the words

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Microorganism Identification Race

- Set up stations with microscopes and prepared slides
- Students rotate through stations, identifying microorganisms
- First team to correctly identify all organisms wins

## 2. pH Change Prediction Game

- Provide groups with different fermentation scenarios
- Groups predict pH changes over time
- Compare predictions with actual data
- Award points for closest predictions

## 3. Fermentation Factor Jigsaw

- Divide class into expert groups (time, temperature, pH, oxygen, initial microbes)
- Each group researches their factor
- Regroup into mixed teams to share knowledge
- Teams create comprehensive fermentation strategy

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Fermentation Experiment Design Challenge

- Pairs design a unique fermentation experiment
- Present designs to class for feedback
- Best design voted on by peers

## 2. Microbe Role-Play

- Assign roles (yeast, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria)
- Groups act out fermentation process
- Other groups guess which microbes are being portrayed

## 3. Fermentation Troubleshooting Scenarios

- Provide groups with problematic fermentation scenarios
- Teams diagnose issues and propose solutions
- Present findings to class

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Fermentation Log Book

- Students maintain a daily log of their group's fermentation experiment
- Record observations, measurements, and hypotheses

## 2. Microorganism Sketch and Describe

- Provide images or slides of key fermentation microorganisms
- Students sketch and write detailed descriptions of each

## 3. pH Curve Analysis

- Give students various pH curves from fermentation processes
- They analyze and interpret the curves, explaining what might have occurred

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Fermentation Fact or Fiction

- Read statements about fermentation
- Students move to one side of the room for "fact," the other for "fiction"
- Discuss correct answers

## 2. One-Minute Paper

- Students write for one minute on:
  - Most interesting thing they learned
  - One question they still have

## 3. Fermentation Process Sequencing

- Provide cards with steps of the fermentation process
- Students arrange in correct order
- Discuss as a class

## 4. Microbe Matchmaking

- Create cards with microorganism names and their functions
- Students match pairs
- Review correct matches as a group
