# Warm-up Activities

## Coffee Bean Moisture Guessing Game
- Provide students with coffee beans at different moisture levels in sealed containers
- Have students shake the containers and guess which has the highest and lowest moisture content
- Reveal the actual moisture levels using a moisture meter

## Sensory Exploration
- Set up stations with coffee samples at different stages of drying
- Students rotate through stations, using touch, smell, and sight to observe differences
- Class discussion on observations and implications for coffee quality

# Main Lesson Activities

## Drying Method Demonstration
- Set up side-by-side demonstrations of sun drying and mechanical drying
- Explain processes, advantages, and disadvantages of each method
- Students take notes and ask questions during the demonstration

## Moisture Meter Workshop
- Demonstrate proper use of a moisture meter
- Students practice measuring moisture content of various coffee samples
- Discuss target moisture levels for different stages of processing and storage

## Storage Conditions Experiment
- Set up small containers of coffee beans in different environmental conditions (varying temperature, humidity, light exposure)
- Students monitor and record changes over time
- Analyze results to understand optimal storage conditions

# Group Work Tasks

## Drying Method Debate
- Divide class into two groups: sun drying advocates and mechanical drying advocates
- Groups research and prepare arguments for their assigned method
- Conduct a structured debate on the pros and cons of each drying method

## Storage Solution Design Challenge
- In small groups, students design an ideal coffee storage facility for Timor-Leste
- Consider local climate, available resources, and best practices
- Groups present their designs to the class for feedback

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Moisture Content Calculation Worksheet
- Provide students with data from various coffee samples
- Students calculate moisture content percentages and determine if samples meet industry standards

## Storage Condition Analysis
- Give students scenarios of different storage environments
- Students evaluate each scenario and recommend improvements based on best practices

## Packaging Material Comparison Chart
- Students research different packaging materials
- Create a comparison chart listing pros, cons, and best uses for each material

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## Coffee Storage Trivia Game
- Divide class into teams
- Ask rapid-fire questions about drying methods, moisture content, and storage best practices
- Award points for correct answers

## Reflection Journal
- Students write a short reflection on what they learned about coffee drying and storage
- Prompt them to consider how they can apply this knowledge to improve coffee quality in Timor-Leste

## One-Minute Paper
- At the end of class, give students one minute to write down:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have about coffee drying and storage
