# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Roast Level Matching Game
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a set of coffee beans at different roast levels and a set of cards with roast level names
- Have students match the beans to the correct roast level names
- Discuss the visual cues they used to make their decisions

## 2. Aroma Exploration
- Set up stations with small containers of freshly ground coffee at different roast levels
- Have students move between stations, smelling each sample
- Ask them to describe the aromas and guess the roast level
- Discuss how aroma changes with roast level

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Interactive Roasting Timeline
- Create a large timeline on the wall or floor
- Provide students with cards describing different stages of the roasting process
- Have students place the cards on the timeline in the correct order
- Discuss each stage, its importance, and the chemical changes occurring

## 2. Roast Profile Puzzle
- Prepare incomplete roast profile graphs
- Have students work in pairs to complete the graphs based on their understanding of the roasting process
- Compare and discuss different completed profiles

## 3. Chemical Changes Demonstration
- Conduct simple experiments to demonstrate Maillard reaction and caramelization
- Use visual aids to explain the formation of aromatics and flavor compounds
- Have students take notes and draw diagrams of the processes

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Roasting Method Comparison
- Divide the class into groups
- Assign each group a different roasting method (traditional pan, wood-fired, drum roaster, air roaster)
- Have groups research their assigned method and create a presentation on its pros, cons, and best practices
- Groups present to the class and engage in a Q&A session

## 2. Roast Profile Design Challenge
- In pairs, have students design a roast profile for a specific Timorese coffee variety
- Provide them with the coffee's characteristics and desired flavor outcome
- Have pairs present their profiles and explain their reasoning
- Class votes on the most promising profile to try in a future roasting session

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Roast Log Analysis
- Provide students with sample roast logs from different batches
- Ask them to analyze the logs and answer questions about roast development, potential flavor outcomes, and suggestions for improvement
- Have students write a short report on their findings

## 2. Flavor Wheel Exploration
- Give each student a copy of the coffee flavor wheel
- Have them choose a specific roast level and identify potential flavor notes associated with that level
- Ask students to write a brief description of how they would expect a coffee at that roast level to taste

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Roasting Myth Busters
- Present common myths or misconceptions about coffee roasting
- Have students discuss in small groups whether each statement is true or false
- Share correct information and discuss why these myths exist

## 2. Roast Level Preference Survey
- Conduct a quick survey of students' preferred roast levels
- Create a visual representation of the class preferences (e.g., bar graph)
- Discuss how personal preferences and cultural factors influence roast level choices

## 3. One-Minute Paper
- Ask students to write for one minute on what they found most interesting or surprising about coffee roasting
- Collect the papers and read a few responses aloud
- Use this to gauge understanding and identify areas for further discussion in future lessons
