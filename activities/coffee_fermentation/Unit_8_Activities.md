# Warm-up Activities

## Coffee Farm Comparison
- Display images of conventional and organic coffee farms side by side
- Ask students to identify differences in appearance, biodiversity, and farming practices
- Discuss potential environmental impacts of each farming method

## Sustainability Word Cloud
- Have students brainstorm words related to sustainability in coffee production
- Create a collaborative word cloud using an online tool or whiteboard
- Discuss the most prominent terms and their significance in sustainable coffee farming

# Main Lesson Activities

## Environmental Impact Stations
- Set up stations around the classroom, each focusing on a different environmental impact of coffee production
- Students rotate through stations, reading information and completing short tasks
- Topics: deforestation, water pollution, soil degradation, carbon emissions

## Organic Farming Practices Jigsaw
- Divide class into expert groups, each focusing on a specific organic farming practice
- Expert groups research their assigned practice and create a short presentation
- Regroup students to share knowledge with peers from other expert groups

## Certification Scheme Debate
- Assign students roles as farmers, consumers, or certification bodies
- Conduct a structured debate on the pros and cons of various certification schemes
- Encourage students to consider multiple perspectives and real-world challenges

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Sustainability Plan Development
- In small groups, students develop a basic sustainability plan for a hypothetical coffee farm in Timor-Leste
- Groups must address soil conservation, water management, and biodiversity protection
- Encourage consideration of economic sustainability aspects as well

## Certification Matching Game
- Create cards with certification logos, principles, and benefits
- In pairs, students match logos to their corresponding principles and benefits
- Discuss results as a class, clarifying any misconceptions

## Sustainable Practice Role-play
- Assign pairs different sustainable practices (e.g., composting, shade-grown coffee)
- Each pair creates and performs a short role-play demonstrating the implementation and benefits of their assigned practice

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Sustainability Assessment Quiz
- Provide students with scenarios of different coffee farming practices
- Ask them to identify sustainable and unsustainable elements in each scenario
- Students justify their answers based on lesson content

## Organic vs. Conventional Comparison Chart
- Students create a chart comparing organic and conventional coffee farming
- Include categories such as environmental impact, cost, yield, and market value
- Encourage critical thinking about trade-offs and long-term sustainability

## Certification Logo Design
- Students design their own sustainability certification logo and criteria
- Must include at least three key principles of sustainable coffee production
- Write a short explanation of how their certification would benefit farmers and the environment

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Sustainability Plan Gallery Walk
- Groups display their sustainability plans around the classroom
- Students circulate, leaving constructive feedback and questions on sticky notes
- Discuss common themes, innovative ideas, and potential challenges as a class

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned about sustainable coffee production
- Share responses with a partner or small group
- Collect papers to assess understanding and inform future lessons

## Sustainable Coffee Pledge
- Students write a personal pledge to support sustainable coffee production
- Pledges can include actions as consumers, future industry professionals, or community members
- Share pledges voluntarily and display in the classroom for ongoing motivation
