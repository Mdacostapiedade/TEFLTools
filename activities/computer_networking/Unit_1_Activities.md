# Warm-up Activities

## Network Scavenger Hunt
- Students walk around the classroom or school, identifying and listing devices connected to networks
- Discuss findings as a class, categorizing devices into different network types (LAN, WAN)

## Network Word Association
- Write "NETWORK" on the board
- Students take turns adding words or phrases related to networks, creating a mind map
- Discuss the connections between different terms

# Main Lesson Activities

## Network Type Sorting Game
- Prepare cards with various network scenarios (e.g., "Home Wi-Fi", "City-wide traffic control system", "International video call")
- Students sort the cards into LAN, MAN, and WAN categories
- Discuss any challenging classifications as a class

## Topology Charades
- Divide class into teams
- Each team acts out a network topology (Bus, Star, Ring) without speaking
- Other teams guess the topology being portrayed

## Real-world Network Examples
- Show images or videos of real network setups in Timor-Leste (e.g., school computer lab, government office)
- Students identify the type of network and possible topology used

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Network Design Challenge
- In small groups, students design a network for a specific scenario (e.g., new university campus, rural health clinic)
- Groups present their designs, explaining their choices of network type and topology

## Pros and Cons Debate
- Assign each group a network topology (Bus, Star, Ring)
- Groups research and present the advantages and disadvantages of their assigned topology
- Class votes on the best topology for different scenarios

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Network Diagram Labeling
- Provide students with unlabeled network diagrams
- Students identify and label network components, types, and topologies

## Network Vocabulary Crossword
- Create a crossword puzzle using key networking terms
- Students complete the puzzle individually, then check answers with a partner

## Network Type Scenario Writing
- Students write short scenarios describing different network types (LAN, MAN, WAN)
- Exchange scenarios with a partner to identify the network type described

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Network Knowledge Quiz
- Quick true/false or multiple-choice quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Students can use colored cards to indicate their answers

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have about networks

## Network Pictionary
- Divide class into teams
- Teams take turns drawing network-related terms for others to guess
- Use terms from the lesson's key vocabulary list
