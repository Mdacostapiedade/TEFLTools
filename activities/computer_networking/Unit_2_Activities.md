# Warm-up Activities

## Network Telephone

1. Arrange students in a circle.
2. Whisper a complex network-related message to one student.
3. Have students pass the message around the circle by whispering.
4. Compare the final message to the original to demonstrate how information can be distorted in transmission.
5. Discuss how network protocols ensure accurate data transfer.

## Internet Scavenger Hunt

1. Provide students with a list of networking terms (e.g., HTTP, router, IP address).
2. Give them 5 minutes to use their smartphones or computers to find real-world examples or definitions.
3. Share findings as a class, discussing how these concepts relate to everyday internet use.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Layer Cake Networking

1. Create a large "layer cake" diagram on the whiteboard representing the OSI model.
2. As you explain each layer, add a "slice" to the cake with its name and function.
3. Use different colored markers for each layer to visually distinguish them.
4. For the TCP/IP model, create a simplified cake next to the OSI model, showing how layers correspond.

## Protocol Charades

1. Write various protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.) on slips of paper.
2. Have students draw a slip and act out the protocol's function without speaking.
3. Other students guess the protocol and explain its purpose.
4. Discuss which layer of the OSI or TCP/IP model each protocol belongs to.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Model Comparison Jigsaw

1. Divide the class into small groups.
2. Assign each group either the OSI or TCP/IP model to become "experts" on.
3. Regroup students so that each new group has at least one expert from each model.
4. Have students teach each other about their assigned model.
5. As a group, create a Venn diagram comparing the two models.

## Protocol Matching Game

1. Create cards with protocol names, their functions, and the layers they operate on.
2. In pairs, have students match the protocol names to their functions and layers.
3. Once finished, pairs can compare their matches with other groups.
4. Discuss any discrepancies as a class.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Layer Labeling Challenge

1. Provide students with a blank diagram of the OSI and TCP/IP models.
2. Set a timer for 3 minutes.
3. Have students label as many layers and their functions as they can remember.
4. Review answers as a class, addressing any misconceptions.

## Protocol Scenario Writing

1. Ask each student to write a short scenario describing how a specific protocol (e.g., HTTP, FTP) is used in a real-world situation in Timor-Leste.
2. Have them identify which layers of the OSI and TCP/IP models are involved in their scenario.
3. Collect scenarios to review and discuss in the next class.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Network Model Pictionary

1. Divide the class into two teams.
2. One student from each team comes to the board.
3. Show them a networking concept or layer function.
4. Have them draw clues for their team to guess the concept.
5. The first team to guess correctly earns a point.

## One-Minute Paper

1. In the last minute of class, ask students to write down:
   - One thing they learned today
   - One question they still have
2. Collect the papers as students leave.
3. Use these responses to address any lingering questions in the next class and gauge understanding.
