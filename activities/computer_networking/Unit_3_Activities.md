# Warm-up Activities

## Network Device Pictionary
- Divide the class into teams
- One student from each team draws a network device (hub, switch, or router) without using words
- Team members guess the device within a time limit
- Rotate through teams, awarding points for correct guesses

## Network Device Matching Game
- Create cards with network device names and their functions
- Students work in pairs to match the devices with their correct functions
- Discuss the matches as a class, clarifying any misconceptions

# Main Lesson Activities

## Interactive Network Device Demonstration
- Set up a small network using actual devices (or virtual simulation)
- Demonstrate how data flows through each device
- Highlight the differences in how hubs, switches, and routers handle data
- Encourage students to ask questions and make observations

## Network Device Comparison Chart
- Create a large chart on the whiteboard with columns for hubs, switches, and routers
- Guide students in filling out the chart with key characteristics and functions of each device
- Discuss the completed chart, emphasizing the unique features of each device

# Group Work Tasks

## Network Scenario Problem-Solving
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a set of network scenario cards
- Groups discuss and decide which network device would be most appropriate for each scenario
- Present solutions to the class, explaining their reasoning

## Build-a-Network Challenge
- Assign each group a different network requirement (e.g., small office, school, home network)
- Groups design a network diagram using the appropriate devices
- Present designs to the class, justifying their device choices

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Network Device Function Flashcards
- Students create flashcards with network devices on one side and functions on the other
- Practice identifying device functions and vice versa
- Pair up to quiz each other using the flashcards

## Online Interactive Quiz
- Provide students with a link to an online quiz about network devices
- Quiz includes multiple-choice, true/false, and matching questions
- Students complete the quiz individually and review their results

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## Network Device Jeopardy
- Create a Jeopardy-style game with categories like "Hubs," "Switches," "Routers," and "Network Basics"
- Divide the class into teams to compete
- Review answers after each question to reinforce learning

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the following prompt:
  "What was the most important thing you learned about network devices today, and what question do you still have?"
- Collect papers and address common questions or misconceptions before dismissing the class

## Device Function Charades
- Students take turns acting out the function of a network device without speaking
- Class guesses which device is being portrayed
- Discuss the key characteristics that helped identify the device
