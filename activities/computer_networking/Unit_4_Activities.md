# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Cable Guessing Game
- Display various network cables (twisted pair, coaxial, fiber optic)
- Students guess which cable is used for what purpose
- Discuss their initial thoughts on speed and reliability

## 2. Connectivity Experience Sharing
- Students share their experiences with different internet connections in Timor-Leste
- Create a quick chart on the board showing the most common connection types among students

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Cable Type Exploration
- Divide class into groups, each assigned a cable type
- Groups research their cable type and create a short presentation
- Present findings to the class, focusing on structure, advantages, and common uses

## 2. Wi-Fi Range Mapping
- Use smartphones to measure Wi-Fi signal strength in different parts of the classroom/building
- Create a simple heat map of signal strength
- Discuss factors affecting Wi-Fi coverage

## 3. ISP Comparison Chart
- Provide students with information on local ISPs
- Create a comparison chart of services, prices, and coverage areas
- Discuss pros and cons of each option for different scenarios (home use, business, rural areas)

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Network Design Challenge
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group designs an optimal network setup for a specific Timorese business scenario (e.g., small caf√©, local government office, rural school)
- Groups present their designs, explaining their choices of wired/wireless technologies

## 2. Connectivity Improvement Brainstorm
- Groups brainstorm ideas to improve internet connectivity in rural areas of Timor-Leste
- Consider both technical and non-technical solutions
- Create a mind map of ideas and potential challenges

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Cable Identification Quiz
- Provide images or physical examples of different cable types
- Students match cable types to descriptions and common uses
- Include questions about advantages and limitations of each type

## 2. Wi-Fi Troubleshooting Scenarios
- Present students with common Wi-Fi issues (e.g., slow connection, limited range)
- Students write step-by-step troubleshooting plans
- Share and discuss solutions as a class

## 3. ISP Research Task
- Students research one local ISP in depth
- Create a one-page fact sheet about the ISP's services, coverage, and unique features
- Optional: Include a brief SWOT analysis of the ISP

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Connectivity Concept Map
- As a class, create a concept map linking different connectivity options, their characteristics, and use cases
- Use this to summarize key points from the lesson

## 2. Future of Connectivity Discussion
- Brief open discussion on the future of internet connectivity in Timor-Leste
- What changes do students predict or hope to see in the next 5-10 years?

## 3. One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most interesting thing they learned today
  2. One question they still have about connectivity options
- Collect papers to inform future lessons and address remaining questions
