# Warm-up Activities

## IP Address Bingo
- Create bingo cards with various IP addresses
- Call out IP address characteristics (e.g., "Class A network", "Private IP address")
- Students mark off matching IP addresses on their cards

## Network Pictionary
- Divide class into teams
- One student from each team draws network-related concepts (e.g., subnet, router)
- Teams guess the concept within a time limit

# Main Lesson Activities

## IP Address Structure Breakdown
- Display an IP address on the board
- Students come up and circle different parts (network ID, host ID)
- Discuss the significance of each part

## Subnet Mask Slider
- Create a physical slider with movable divider representing the subnet mask
- Demonstrate how moving the slider changes network and host portions

## CIDR Notation Race
- Display IP addresses with traditional subnet masks
- Students race to convert them to CIDR notation
- First correct answer wins a point

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Subnetting Puzzle
- Provide groups with a set of network requirements
- Groups must design an efficient subnetting scheme
- Present and justify their solutions to the class

## Network Design Challenge
- Assign each group a different scenario (e.g., school, hospital)
- Groups create an IP addressing plan for their assigned scenario
- Include considerations for future growth

## IP Address Class Sorting
- Provide a mix of IP addresses on cards
- Groups sort them into correct address classes
- Discuss any challenging or ambiguous cases

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Subnet Calculator Creation
- Students create a simple subnet calculator using spreadsheet software
- Include inputs for IP address and subnet mask
- Calculate network ID, broadcast address, and usable IP range

## IPv4 to IPv6 Conversion
- Provide a list of IPv4 addresses
- Students convert them to IPv6 format
- Discuss the benefits and challenges of IPv6 adoption

## Subnetting Worksheet
- Individual worksheet with various subnetting problems
- Include questions on CIDR notation, available hosts, and subnet design

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## IP Address Jeopardy
- Create a Jeopardy-style game with categories like "Address Classes", "Subnetting", "CIDR"
- Students answer questions to review key concepts

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have

## Real-World Application Discussion
- Discuss how the lesson's concepts apply to Timor-Leste's network infrastructure
- Brainstorm ideas for improving internet connectivity in rural areas
