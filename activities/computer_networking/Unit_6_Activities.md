# Warm-up Activities

## Network Security Trivia

1. Divide the class into small teams.
2. Present a series of quick-fire questions about basic network concepts and security terms.
3. Teams earn points for correct answers.
4. Discuss answers briefly to refresh knowledge.

## Security Threat Matching

1. Prepare cards with security threats on one set and their definitions on another.
2. Students work in pairs to match threats with their correct definitions.
3. Review answers as a class, clarifying any misconceptions.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Interactive Presentation: "Anatomy of a Cyber Attack"

1. Use a multimedia presentation to walk through a simulated cyber attack.
2. At each stage, pause and ask students to identify potential security measures.
3. Discuss the effectiveness of various security measures in real-world scenarios.

## Firewall Configuration Demonstration

1. Using network simulation software, demonstrate how to configure basic firewall rules.
2. Explain the purpose of each rule and its impact on network traffic.
3. Show how different configurations affect network security.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Security Vulnerability Hunt

1. Provide groups with a network diagram of a fictional Timorese organization.
2. Groups identify and list potential security vulnerabilities.
3. Each group presents their findings, explaining why they consider each point a vulnerability.

## Encryption Experiment

1. In pairs, students use an online encryption tool to encrypt and decrypt messages.
2. They experiment with different encryption methods and key lengths.
3. Pairs discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each method they tried.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Firewall Rule Creation

1. Provide students with a list of network security requirements for a small business.
2. Each student creates a set of firewall rules to meet these requirements using simulation software.
3. Students test their rules to ensure they work as intended.

## Security Protocol Research

1. Assign each student a specific security protocol (e.g., SSL, TLS, HTTPS).
2. Students research and create a one-page summary of their assigned protocol.
3. Include its purpose, how it works, and its importance in network security.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Security Measures Brainstorm

1. As a class, brainstorm a list of security measures discussed during the lesson.
2. Categorize these measures (e.g., preventive, detective, corrective).
3. Discuss which measures might be most relevant for organizations in Timor-Leste.

## One-Minute Paper

1. Students write for one minute on:
   - The most important thing they learned today
   - One question they still have about network security
2. Collect papers and address common themes or questions before dismissing the class.

## Security News Roundup

1. Share recent headlines related to cybersecurity incidents in Southeast Asia.
2. Briefly discuss how the security concepts learned in class relate to these real-world events.
3. Encourage students to stay informed about current security trends.
