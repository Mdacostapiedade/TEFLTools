# Warm-up Activities

## Cultural Connection Circle (15 minutes)
1. Form a circle with all students.
2. Each student shares a traditional Timorese healing practice involving touch or head/spine manipulation.
3. Discuss similarities and differences between shared practices and craniosacral therapy principles.

## Anatomy Charades (10 minutes)
1. Divide class into small groups.
2. Each group receives a card with a key anatomical structure related to the craniosacral system.
3. Groups take turns acting out their structure without speaking while others guess.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Craniosacral System Model Building (30 minutes)
1. Provide groups with craft materials (clay, pipe cleaners, cardboard, etc.).
2. Each group creates a 3D model of the craniosacral system.
3. Groups present their models, explaining key components.

## Rhythm Detection Station Rotation (45 minutes)
Set up stations around the room:
1. Skull model palpation
2. Partner head palpation
3. Sacrum model palpation
4. Partner sacrum palpation
5. Video demonstration of craniosacral rhythm

Students rotate through stations, practicing palpation and observing the craniosacral rhythm.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Craniosacral System Mapping (25 minutes)
1. In pairs, students create a large diagram of the craniosacral system on poster paper.
2. Label key structures and indicate cerebrospinal fluid flow.
3. Pairs exchange diagrams and provide feedback.

## Technique Teach-Back (30 minutes)
1. Assign each pair a basic palpation technique.
2. Pairs research and practice their technique.
3. Each pair teaches their technique to another pair.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Journaling: Palpation Sensations (15 minutes)
Students write about their experience feeling the craniosacral rhythm, describing sensations and any challenges encountered.

## Self-Palpation Exploration (20 minutes)
Guide students through self-palpation exercises to feel their own cranial bones and sacrum, noting any observations.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Concept Consolidation Game (15 minutes)
1. Create a list of key terms and concepts covered in the lesson.
2. Students stand in a circle and toss a soft ball to each other.
3. When catching the ball, the student must correctly define or explain a term from the list.

## Reflection and Integration Circle (20 minutes)
1. Students sit in a circle and share one new thing they learned.
2. Discuss how this new knowledge might complement or enhance traditional Timorese healing practices.
3. End with a brief guided meditation focusing on feeling one's own craniosacral rhythm.
