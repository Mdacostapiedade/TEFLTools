# Warm-up Activities

## Pulse Exploration
- In pairs, students take turns finding and palpating each other's pulse at different locations (wrist, neck, temple, foot).
- Discuss how the pulse feels different at various sites and relate this to the concept of listening stations.

## Body Awareness Meditation
- Guide students through a brief body scan meditation, focusing on subtle sensations in different parts of the body.
- Relate this experience to the sensitivity required for craniosacral palpation.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Listening Station Treasure Hunt
- Set up stations around the room with anatomical models or diagrams.
- Students rotate through stations, identifying and marking listening stations on the models/diagrams.
- Provide immediate feedback at each station.

## Rhythm Recognition Game
- Play recordings or use a metronome to demonstrate different rhythms.
- Students practice feeling these rhythms in their own body (e.g., breath, heartbeat).
- Relate this to recognizing and assessing the craniosacral rhythm.

## Restriction Simulation
- Use props (e.g., elastic bands, clay) to create models demonstrating unrestricted vs. restricted movement.
- Students manipulate the models to understand how restrictions feel and affect movement.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Listening Station Mapping
- In small groups, create a large-scale map of the body on butcher paper.
- Mark and label all listening stations, adding brief descriptions of what to feel for at each point.
- Groups present their maps to the class, explaining their choices.

## Craniosacral Rhythm Orchestra
- Assign each group member a different component of the craniosacral rhythm (rate, amplitude, symmetry, quality).
- Create a physical representation of the rhythm using movement, sound, or visual aids.
- Perform the "rhythm orchestra" for the class, explaining each component.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Journal Reflection
- Students spend 10 minutes writing about their experience palpating the craniosacral rhythm.
- Prompt questions: What was challenging? What surprised you? How did it compare to feeling the pulse?

## Self-Palpation Practice
- Guide students through self-palpation of accessible listening stations (e.g., temples, occiput).
- Students record their observations, focusing on subtle differences between left and right sides.

## Visualization Exercise
- Students close their eyes and visualize the flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the craniosacral system.
- Draw or describe the visualization, relating it to the concept of restrictions and free flow.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Concept Mapping
- Individually or in pairs, create a concept map linking key terms from the lesson (listening station, craniosacral rhythm, restriction, etc.).
- Share and discuss maps, filling in any gaps in understanding.

## One-Minute Teacher
- Each student prepares a one-minute explanation of a key concept from the lesson.
- Randomly select students to present their "mini-lesson" to the class.

## Reflection Circle
- Form a circle and pass an object (e.g., a small skull model) around.
- When holding the object, each person shares one thing they learned or found interesting about craniosacral assessment.
