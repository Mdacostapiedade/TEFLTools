## Treatment Plan Puzzle (20 minutes)
- Provide students with scrambled components of a treatment plan on separate cards.
- Students work individually to arrange the cards in a logical order, creating a comprehensive treatment plan.
- Discuss the results as a class, highlighting the importance of each component.

## Cultural Bridge Building (25 minutes)

## Educational Material Design Workshop (45 minutes)
- Form groups of 4-5 students.
