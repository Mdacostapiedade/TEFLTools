# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Timor-Leste Development Bingo

- Create a bingo card with various development challenges and economic indicators.
- Students mingle and find classmates who can provide information about each item.
- First to complete a row or column shouts "Bingo!" and shares their findings.

## 2. Economic Time Traveler

- Students imagine they've traveled 20 years into Timor-Leste's future.
- In pairs, they describe what they see, focusing on economic and social changes.
- Share the most interesting or surprising predictions with the class.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. RCT Simulation

- Divide the class into "researchers" and "participants."
- Conduct a simple RCT (e.g., testing if a specific study method improves test scores).
- Analyze results and discuss the process, challenges, and implications.

## 2. Development Economics Timeline

- Create a large timeline on the classroom wall.
- Students add key events, theories, and approaches in development economics.
- Discuss how the field has evolved and where RCTs fit in.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Timor-Leste Challenge Mapping

- In groups of 3-4, students create a mind map of Timor-Leste's development challenges.
- Groups connect challenges and identify potential root causes.
- Present findings to the class and discuss similarities and differences.

## 2. RCT Design Workshop

- In pairs, students design a hypothetical RCT for a specific development challenge in Timor-Leste.
- Pairs swap designs and provide constructive feedback.
- Refine designs based on feedback and present to the class.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Case Study Analysis

- Provide students with a detailed case study of an RCT in a developing country.
- Students complete a structured analysis worksheet, identifying key components, methodology, and results.
- Write a brief reflection on how the study's findings could apply to Timor-Leste.

## 2. Development Economics Concept Map

- Students create individual concept maps linking key terms and ideas from the lesson.
- Include connections between RCTs, development challenges, and potential solutions.
- Add specific examples or applications relevant to Timor-Leste.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Three-Two-One Reflection

- Students write down:
  - 3 things they learned
  - 2 questions they still have
  - 1 way they could apply this knowledge to help Timor-Leste
- Share reflections in small groups or with the whole class.

## 2. RCT Quick Quiz

- Conduct a quick, interactive quiz using a tool like Kahoot! or Quizlet Live.
- Focus on key concepts, terminology, and applications of RCTs in development economics.
- Discuss any misconceptions or challenging questions as a class.
