# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Health Statistics Scavenger Hunt
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a set of health statistics from various countries, including Timor-Leste
- Challenge groups to find and rank countries based on specific health indicators (e.g., life expectancy, infant mortality rate)
- Discuss findings and focus on Timor-Leste's position

## 2. Health and Wealth Matching Game
- Create cards with country names and corresponding health and economic indicators
- Students work in pairs to match countries with their correct indicators
- Discuss patterns observed and how health relates to economic development

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Health Intervention Carousel
- Set up stations around the room, each focusing on a different health intervention (e.g., deworming, vaccination, bed nets)
- Students rotate through stations, reading about each intervention and its impact
- At each station, students answer a brief question or complete a short task related to the intervention

## 2. Timor-Leste Health Challenge Brainstorm
- Display a large map of Timor-Leste
- Provide students with sticky notes to write down health challenges they've learned about
- Students place their notes on the map in relevant locations
- Facilitate a discussion about the geographic distribution of health issues

## 3. Policy Analysis Jigsaw
- Divide students into "expert groups," each focusing on a specific health policy in Timor-Leste
- Expert groups research and discuss their assigned policy
- Regroup students into "teaching groups" with one expert from each policy area
- Experts share their knowledge with their new group

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. District Health Profile Creation
- Assign each group a different district of Timor-Leste
- Provide health statistics and demographic information for each district
- Groups create a visual health profile for their assigned district
- Groups present their profiles to the class, highlighting key health challenges

## 2. Intervention Design Challenge
- Present groups with a specific health issue in Timor-Leste (e.g., malnutrition in rural areas)
- Groups brainstorm potential interventions based on evidence from other countries
- Groups create a poster outlining their proposed intervention, implementation plan, and expected outcomes
- Host a "gallery walk" where groups present their posters and receive feedback

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Health Intervention Analysis Worksheet
- Provide students with a summary of a recent health intervention study in Timor-Leste
- Students complete a worksheet analyzing the study's methodology, findings, and implications
- Include questions that prompt critical thinking about the study's limitations and potential improvements

## 2. Personal Reflection Journal
- Students write a reflective journal entry on how the lesson has changed their understanding of health and development
- Prompt students to consider how they might apply this knowledge in their future careers or personal lives

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Health Intervention Elevator Pitch
- Students have 60 seconds to pitch their most important takeaway from the lesson
- Encourage students to focus on how health interventions can impact poverty alleviation in Timor-Leste

## 2. Question Chain
- Start with one student asking a question about the lesson content
- The next student answers the question and then asks a new one
- Continue until all students have participated, creating a chain of questions and answers

## 3. Mind Map Creation
- As a class, create a large mind map on the whiteboard connecting key concepts from the lesson
- Include health challenges, interventions, policies, and their relationships to poverty alleviation
- Use this visual representation to summarize the main points of the lesson
