- Groups present their designs, including target clientele, loan products, and risk management strategies.

## Barrier Breakdown
- Pairs identify potential barriers to financial inclusion in Timor-Leste.
- They then brainstorm innovative solutions to overcome these barriers.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Loan Officer Simulation
- Students role-play as loan officers, evaluating hypothetical loan applications from Timorese entrepreneurs.

## Exit Ticket
- Before leaving, students complete a brief form answering:
  1. Two things they learned
  2. One question they still have
  3. One way they could apply this knowledge in Timor-Leste
