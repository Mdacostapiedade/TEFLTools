# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Development Challenge Gallery Walk

- Set up stations around the room with photos and brief descriptions of various development challenges in Timor-Leste.
- Students walk around, observe, and jot down ideas for potential solutions.
- Discuss as a class which challenges might be suitable for RCT studies.

## 2. RCT Concept Mapping

- In pairs, students create a mind map of what they already know about RCTs.
- Share and compare maps with another pair, adding new information.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. RCT Design Steps Jigsaw

- Divide class into expert groups, each focusing on one step of RCT design.
- Groups study their assigned step and prepare to teach others.
- Regroup into mixed teams where each student teaches their expert topic.

## 2. Ethical Considerations Debate

- Present a controversial RCT scenario in Timor-Leste.
- Divide class into pro and con teams to debate the ethical implications.
- Conclude with a discussion on balancing research goals with ethical concerns.

## 3. Timor-Leste Context Analysis

- Provide case studies of RCTs from other countries.
- Students identify potential challenges in adapting these to Timor-Leste.
- Create a class list of context-specific considerations for RCTs in Timor-Leste.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. RCT Proposal Development

- In groups of 3-4, develop a basic RCT proposal for a Timor-Leste development challenge.
- Include research question, intervention, randomization strategy, and data collection plan.
- Present proposals to class for feedback and discussion.

## 2. Ethical Review Board Simulation

- Divide class into RCT proposal teams and ethical review boards.
- Teams present their proposals to review boards for ethical approval.
- Review boards provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. RCT Design Critique

- Provide students with a flawed RCT design for Timor-Leste.
- Individually, students identify issues and suggest improvements.
- Share findings with a partner and compile a list of common pitfalls to avoid.

## 2. Randomization Strategy Worksheet

- Students complete a worksheet on different randomization strategies.
- Apply each strategy to a hypothetical Timor-Leste scenario.
- Evaluate pros and cons of each approach.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. RCT Design Steps Recap Race

- Create cards with RCT design steps and key concepts.
- In small groups, students race to arrange cards in correct order.
- Discuss any steps that caused confusion or disagreement.

## 2. Timor-Leste RCT Vision Board

- Individually, students create a visual representation of their ideal RCT for Timor-Leste.
- Include research question, expected impact, and key design elements.
- Gallery walk to view and discuss peers' visions.

## 3. One-Minute Paper

- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned about RCTs in Timor-Leste.
  2. One question they still have about the topic.
- Collect papers to inform future lessons and address remaining questions.
