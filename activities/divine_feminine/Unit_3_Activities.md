# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Gender Role Brainstorm
- In pairs, students create two lists: traditional male and female roles in Timorese society
- Share with class and discuss how these roles might have influenced sexual attitudes

## 2. Animism Exploration
- Individual reflection: students write down what they know about animism
- Share ideas in small groups, then create a class mind map on the whiteboard

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Jigsaw Reading
- Divide class into expert groups, each focusing on a different aspect of pre-colonial Timorese sexuality
- Students read assigned sections from Trindade & Castro (2007)
- Expert groups discuss and summarize key points
- Regroup into mixed teams to share knowledge

## 2. Sacred House Simulation
- Set up classroom to represent a sacred house (uma lulik)
- Students role-play various ceremonies related to sexuality and gender
- Discuss the significance of each ritual and its impact on sexual attitudes

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Ritual Analysis
- In small groups, students are assigned a specific pre-colonial ritual related to sexuality
- Groups research and prepare a presentation on the ritual's purpose, participants, and significance
- Present findings to the class and lead a short discussion

## 2. Comparative Timeline
- Pairs create a timeline comparing pre-colonial sexual practices with modern attitudes
- Include key events, beliefs, and customs that have shaped sexual norms
- Share timelines and discuss major turning points in Timorese sexual history

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Reflective Journal Entry
- Students write a personal reflection on how pre-colonial Timorese views on sexuality compare to their own beliefs
- Encourage critical thinking about the origins of personal attitudes

## 2. Visual Representation
- Create an artistic piece (drawing, collage, or digital art) depicting a key concept from the lesson
- Write a short explanation of the symbolism used in the artwork

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Exit Ticket
- Students write three things they learned, two things they found interesting, and one question they still have
- Collect and use responses to guide future lessons or discussions

## 2. Concept Mapping
- As a class, create a large concept map connecting key terms and ideas from the lesson
- Students take turns adding to the map and explaining connections
- Take a photo of the final map for future reference
