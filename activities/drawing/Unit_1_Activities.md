Here's a set of engaging activities for the Foundations of Drawing lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Foundations of Drawing

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### a) Scribble Transformation (5 minutes)
- Students make random scribbles on paper
- They then turn these scribbles into recognizable objects or scenes
- This activity encourages creativity and loosens up the hand

### b) One-Minute Sketches (5 minutes)
- Teacher calls out simple objects (e.g., cup, shoe, leaf)
- Students quickly sketch each object in one minute
- This exercise improves observational skills and quick drawing

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### a) Shading Gradient Exercise (10 minutes)
- Students create a series of boxes on their paper
- They practice shading from light to dark across the boxes
- This helps understand pressure control and tonal values

### b) Light Source Exploration (15 minutes)
- Use a small lamp or flashlight to illuminate a simple object
- Students observe and sketch the object, focusing on highlights and shadows
- Move the light source to different positions and repeat

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### a) Shadow Detectives (15 minutes)
- In pairs, students take turns creating shadow shapes with their hands
- The partner tries to guess the shape and then sketches it
- This activity reinforces observation of light and shadow

### b) Collaborative Still Life (20 minutes)
- In groups of 3-4, students arrange a still life using round fruits
- Each student sketches the arrangement from their perspective
- Groups compare drawings and discuss differences in viewpoints

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### a) Sphere Challenge (15 minutes)
- Students draw multiple spheres using different shading techniques
- They experiment with hatching, cross-hatching, and blending
- This reinforces various shading methods

### b) Texture Exploration (10 minutes)
- Students choose an object with an interesting texture (e.g., tree bark, woven basket)
- They create a small, detailed sketch focusing on representing the texture
- This exercise develops observational skills and texture rendering techniques

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### a) Drawing Telephone (10 minutes)
- Students sit in a circle and start by drawing a simple object
- They pass their drawing to the next person, who adds to it
- Continue until drawings return to their original artists
- Discuss how the drawings evolved and changed

### b) Reflection Sketches (5 minutes)
- Students quickly sketch something they learned or found interesting in the lesson
- They can add a short written explanation if desired
- This activity reinforces key concepts and encourages self-reflection

These activities are designed to be engaging, reinforce the lesson's key concepts, and cater to different learning styles. They also take into account the local context and available materials in Timor-Leste.
