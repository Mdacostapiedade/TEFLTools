- Back in class, they quickly sketch each item

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Shape Breakdown Demo
- Duration: 15 minutes
- Instructor demonstrates breaking down complex plant forms into basic shapes
- Students follow along, practicing with simple local plants

### Texture Technique Station Rotation

- One student describes a texture, the other tries to draw it without seeing an example

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### 3D Leaf Study
- Duration: 20 minutes
- Students choose a leaf and create multiple drawings showing different angles and lighting

### Tree Portrait

- Students quickly sketch and guess what part of the plant it is

### Reflection Journaling
- Duration: 5 minutes
- Students write a brief reflection on what they learned about observing and drawing natural forms

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of the Natural Forms lesson while keeping students engaged and encouraging both individual and collaborative learning. They provide opportunities for hands-on practice, peer interaction, and creative exploration of the local flora.
