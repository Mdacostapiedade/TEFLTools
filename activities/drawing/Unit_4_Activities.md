- Groups take turns acting out their element without speaking
- Other groups guess the element

### Quick Sketch Roulette (5 minutes)
- Students sit in a circle with their sketchbooks
- Teacher calls out a landscape element every 30 seconds
- Students quickly sketch each element, building a landscape

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Atmospheric Perspective Gradient (15 minutes)
- Students create a gradient strip showing atmospheric perspective
- Use pencil or charcoal to show gradual fading of detail and contrast
- Label each section of the gradient (foreground, middle ground, background)

### Rule of Thirds Grid Practice (20 minutes)
- Students draw a 3x3 grid on their paper
- Practice placing landscape elements at intersection points
- Create multiple thumbnail compositions using the grid

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Collaborative Landscape (30 minutes)
- In pairs, students create a large landscape drawing together
- One student focuses on foreground, the other on background
- Switch roles halfway through to work on middle ground together

### Landscape Element Cards (20 minutes)
- In small groups, create a set of cards with different landscape elements
- Exchange cards with another group
- Create a landscape composition using the received cards

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Depth Through Size and Detail (15 minutes)
- Draw the same object (e.g., a tree) three times
- Vary size and detail to show foreground, middle ground, and background

### Local Landmark Sketch (20 minutes)
- Students choose a well-known local landmark
- Create a landscape drawing featuring the landmark
- Focus on applying atmospheric perspective and composition techniques

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### Landscape Story Circle (10 minutes)
- Students sit in a circle with their landscape drawings
- Each student adds one sentence to a story inspired by the drawings
- Continue around the circle until a complete story is formed

### Three Things Gallery Walk (15 minutes)
- Display all student work
- Students walk around and observe peers' drawings
- Write down three things they learned or found interesting
- Share observations with the class

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of landscape drawing, including composition, atmospheric perspective, and the rule of thirds. They also encourage creativity, collaboration, and engagement with local surroundings.
