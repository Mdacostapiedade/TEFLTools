Here's a set of engaging activities for the "Still Life and Textures" lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Still Life and Textures Lesson

## Warm-up Activities

1. **Texture Touch Challenge (5 minutes)**
   - Place various textured objects in a box (e.g., tais fabric, smooth stone, rough bark)
   - Students reach in without looking and sketch what they feel

2. **Rapid Texture Sketching (5 minutes)**
   - Show images of different textures for 30 seconds each
   - Students quickly sketch the texture, focusing on capturing its essence

## Main Lesson Activities

1. **Texture Technique Stations (20 minutes)**
   - Set up stations with different objects and texture techniques
   - Students rotate through stations, practicing each technique for 5 minutes

2. **Still Life Assembly Challenge (15 minutes)**
   - Divide class into small groups
   - Each group arranges a still life using provided objects
   - Groups sketch each other's arrangements

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

1. **Texture Detectives (15 minutes)**
   - In pairs, students take turns describing a texture without naming the object
   - Partner tries to draw the texture based on the description

2. **Collaborative Still Life (20 minutes)**
   - In groups of 3-4, create a large still life drawing
   - Each student is responsible for different objects or areas of the composition

## Individual Practice Exercises

1. **Texture Gradient Study (15 minutes)**
   - Students choose an object with varying textures (e.g., tree with leaves, bark, and roots)
   - Create a detailed study showing the transition between textures

2. **Mixed Media Texture Exploration (20 minutes)**
   - Provide various materials (e.g., charcoal, pencils, erasers, textured paper)
   - Students experiment with combining techniques to create complex textures

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

1. **Texture Guessing Game (10 minutes)**
   - Display student texture studies without labels
   - Class tries to guess the object or material depicted

2. **Reflection Circle (10 minutes)**
   - Students sit in a circle and share one new technique they learned
   - Discuss how they might apply these skills to future drawings

3. **Mini-Exhibition (15 minutes)**
   - Students display their work around the room
   - Conduct a silent gallery walk, leaving positive feedback on sticky notes

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of texture and still life composition while providing engaging, hands-on experiences for students. They encourage experimentation, collaboration, and reflection on the learned techniques.
