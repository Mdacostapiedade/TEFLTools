Here's a set of engaging activities for the Figure Drawing Basics lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Figure Drawing Basics

## Warm-up Activities

1. **Mirror Movements**: (5 minutes)
   - Students pair up and stand facing each other.
   - One student makes slow, fluid movements while the other mirrors them.
   - Switch roles after 2 minutes.
   - This activity helps students observe and understand body movements.

2. **Scribble Figures**: (5 minutes)
   - Students quickly scribble abstract shapes on paper.
   - They then look for human-like figures in their scribbles and outline them.
   - This exercise encourages seeing forms in abstract shapes and loosens up the hand.

## Main Lesson Activities

1. **Proportion Puzzle**: (15 minutes)
   - Provide students with cut-out body parts of different sizes.
   - Students arrange these parts to create properly proportioned figures.
   - Discuss the results and how proportions affect the overall appearance.

2. **Gesture Drawing Carousel**: (20 minutes)
   - Set up 5-6 stations around the room with different pose references.
   - Students rotate through stations, doing 1-minute gesture drawings at each.
   - Gradually reduce time to 30 seconds for the last few rotations.

3. **Expression Exaggeration**: (15 minutes)
   - Show images of subtle facial expressions.
   - Students draw exaggerated versions of these expressions.
   - Discuss how small changes in facial features convey emotions.

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

1. **Living Sculptures**: (20 minutes)
   - In groups of 3-4, students create "living sculptures" by posing together.
   - One group member sketches while others hold the pose.
   - Groups rotate roles and poses every 5 minutes.

2. **Proportion Detectives**: (15 minutes)
   - In pairs, students take turns measuring each other's proportions.
   - They compare findings with the 8-head proportion system.
   - Discuss variations and why they might occur.

## Individual Practice Exercises

1. **Rapid Fire Portraits**: (10 minutes)
   - Students draw quick self-portraits in various styles:
     * Realistic (3 minutes)
     * Cartoon (2 minutes)
     * Abstract (1 minute)
     * Eyes closed (1 minute)

2. **Figure Construction Challenge**: (15 minutes)
   - Provide a list of actions (e.g., running, jumping, sitting).
   - Students construct simplified figures performing these actions using basic shapes.

3. **Emotion in Motion**: (10 minutes)
   - Students draw a series of stick figures expressing different emotions through body language.
   - Challenge them to convey emotions without facial features.

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

1. **Gallery Walk**: (10 minutes)
   - Students display their best work from the lesson.
   - Class does a silent "gallery walk" to observe each other's drawings.
   - Optional: Leave positive comments on sticky notes.

2. **Gesture Drawing Telephone**: (5 minutes)
   - Class sits in a circle.
   - First student strikes a pose for 10 seconds.
   - Next student quickly sketches the pose, then strikes a new pose.
   - Continue around the circle.

3. **Reflection Sketches**: (5 minutes)
   - Students draw a simple sketch representing what they learned in the lesson.
   - Share and discuss these reflection sketches in small groups.

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of figure drawing basics while keeping students engaged and encouraging both individual and collaborative learning.
