# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Child Care Challenge Brainstorm (5 minutes)
- Students write down as many challenges to accessing child care as they can think of in 2 minutes
- Share ideas with a partner, then compile a class list on the whiteboard

## 2. Geographic Barriers Map (10 minutes)
- In small groups, students draw a simple map of Timor-Leste
- Mark urban centers and rural areas, then draw lines to represent potential barriers (mountains, rivers, lack of roads)
- Groups present their maps, explaining how geography might impact child care access

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Vulnerable Populations Gallery Walk (20 minutes)
- Create stations around the room with information about different vulnerable groups (e.g., low-income families, single parents, linguistic minorities)
- Students rotate through stations, taking notes on specific challenges each group faces
- Class discussion to synthesize findings

## 2. Financial Constraints Simulation (15 minutes)
- Give students a hypothetical family budget and child care costs
- Students must make decisions about allocating resources, balancing work and child care needs
- Debrief on the difficult choices families face and the impact on child care access

## 3. Cultural Competence Role-Play (15 minutes)
- Students act out scenarios where child care providers interact with families from different cultural backgrounds

- Class discussion on the importance of cultural competence in child care settings

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Case Study Analysis (20 minutes)
- In pairs, students analyze a detailed case study of a vulnerable family seeking child care
- Identify specific challenges and brainstorm potential solutions
- Create a visual representation (e.g., flowchart, mind map) of the family's situation

## 2. Policy Recommendation Development (25 minutes)
- Small groups choose one specific challenge (e.g., transportation, affordability)
- Research existing policies and develop a new policy recommendation to address the challenge
- Present recommendations to the class in a mock policy forum

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Reflective Journal Entry (10 minutes)
- Students write a personal reflection on how the challenges discussed might impact a child's development and family well-being
- Encourage connections to course material and personal experiences

## 2. Resource Guide Creation (15 minutes)

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Three-Two-One Reflection (5 minutes)
- Students write down:
  * 3 new things they learned
  * 2 questions they still have
  * 1 action they can take to support vulnerable families accessing child care

## 2. Solution Showcase (10 minutes)

- Class votes on the most innovative or impactful ideas

## 3. Commitment Cards (5 minutes)
