# Warm-up Activities

## Cultural Safety Circle
- Students stand in a circle and take turns sharing one cultural practice from Timor-Leste that makes them feel safe or supported.
- After each share, the group repeats a phrase in Tetum that means "We hear you and support you."

## Emotion Word Wall
- In small groups, students brainstorm emotion words in Tetum and write them on sticky notes.
- Groups place their notes on a large wall chart, clustering similar emotions together.
- Discuss any unique Timorese emotional concepts that don't have direct English translations.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Trauma-Informed Principles Jigsaw
- Divide class into five groups, each assigned one principle of trauma-informed care.
- Groups research their principle and create a poster explaining it with Timorese examples.
- Groups then split up to teach other groups about their principle.

## Cultural Adaptation Stations
- Set up five stations, each representing a different setting in Timor-Leste (e.g., health clinic, school, community center).
- Students rotate through stations, discussing how to adapt trauma-informed principles to each setting.
- Groups record ideas on flipchart paper at each station.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Scenario Analysis Pairs
- Provide pairs with scenario cards describing common situations in Timor-Leste.
- Pairs discuss how to apply trauma-informed principles to each scenario.
- Pairs then switch cards with another pair and compare approaches.

## Traditional Practice Integration Groups
- In small groups, students research a traditional Timorese practice (e.g., Tara Bandu).
- Groups identify elements of the practice that align with trauma-informed care.
- Create a presentation on how to integrate the traditional practice with modern approaches.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Reflective Journaling
- Students write a personal reflection on how trauma-informed principles could have improved a past experience in their community.
- Encourage use of Tetum or local dialect for authentic expression.

## Trauma-Informed Language Translation
- Provide a list of common phrases used in care settings.
- Students rewrite each phrase using trauma-informed language, translating into Tetum.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Principle Charades
- Students take turns acting out one of the trauma-informed principles without speaking.
- Rest of the class guesses the principle and provides a Timorese example of its application.

## Commitment Circle
- Students stand in a circle and each shares one way they will apply a trauma-informed principle in their daily life or work.
- After each share, the group responds with a traditional Timorese gesture of support or agreement.

## Wisdom Wall
