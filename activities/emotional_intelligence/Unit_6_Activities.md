# Warm-up Activities

## Community Issue Gallery Walk
- Post flip chart papers around the room with different community issues related to emotional well-being (e.g., domestic violence, substance abuse, youth unemployment).
- Students walk around, writing their thoughts or observations on each issue.
- Discuss as a class, identifying common themes and concerns.

## Emotional Intelligence Charades
- Students act out different scenarios demonstrating emotional intelligence skills.
- Others guess the skill being demonstrated (e.g., active listening, empathy, self-regulation).

# Main Lesson Activities

## Needs Assessment Jigsaw
- Divide students into "expert groups" to study different needs assessment techniques.
- Regroup students to share their expertise and compile a comprehensive list of techniques.

## Cultural Adaptation Workshop
- Present a generic emotional well-being intervention.
- In small groups, students adapt the intervention to be culturally appropriate for Timor-Leste.
- Groups present their adaptations, discussing the rationale behind their changes.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Community Stakeholder Mapping
- In pairs, create a stakeholder map for a hypothetical community project.
- Identify key individuals, organizations, and groups that should be involved.
- Present maps to another pair, explaining the importance of each stakeholder.

## Intervention Design Challenge
- In groups of 4-5, design a community-based emotional well-being intervention.
- Each group receives a different target population (e.g., youth, elderly, new mothers).
- Groups present their interventions, receiving feedback from peers and the instructor.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Reflective Journaling
- Students write a personal reflection on how they could apply emotional intelligence skills in their daily lives or future work.

## Mini Needs Assessment Plan
- Individually, students create a brief plan for conducting a needs assessment in their own community.
- Include methods, potential challenges, and strategies for community engagement.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Project Proposal Gallery
- Students display their group project proposals around the room.
- Conduct a "gallery walk" where students view and provide written feedback on other groups' proposals.

## Commitment Circle
- Form a circle and have each student share one concrete action they commit to taking to promote emotional well-being in their community.

## Gratitude Practice
- End the lesson with a brief gratitude exercise, where students share something they're grateful for from the lesson or their learning experience.
