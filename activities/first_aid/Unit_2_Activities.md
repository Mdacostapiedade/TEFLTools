# Warm-up Activities

## Emergency Scenario Quick-fire
- Instructor calls out various emergency scenarios
- Students quickly respond with the first safety consideration that comes to mind
- Scenarios include: car accident, house fire, drowning, snake bite, earthquake

## Safety Hazard Pictionary
- Students take turns drawing common safety hazards on the whiteboard
- Other students guess the hazard and suggest how to mitigate it

# Main Lesson Activities

## Scene Safety Scavenger Hunt
- Set up a mock emergency scene with various hidden hazards
- Students work in pairs to identify and list all potential safety risks
- Discuss findings as a class, emphasizing the importance of thorough assessment

## ABCDE Relay Race
- Divide class into teams
- Each team member must correctly demonstrate one step of the primary survey (ABCDE) on a mannequin
- First team to complete all steps correctly wins

## Triage Tag Sorting
- Provide students with a set of patient scenario cards
- Students must quickly sort the cards into appropriate triage categories using the START method
- Discuss decisions as a class

# Group Work Tasks

## Community Event Safety Plan
- In small groups, students create a safety plan for a local community event
- Plan should include risk assessment, emergency procedures, and resource allocation
- Groups present their plans to the class for feedback

## Mass Casualty Incident Simulation
- Set up a large-scale mock disaster scene
- Assign roles: victims, first responders, incident commanders
- Groups work together to triage and treat victims while maintaining scene safety

# Pair Work Tasks

## "Spot the Difference" Safety Assessment
- Provide pairs with two similar emergency scene images
- Students identify differences in safety considerations between the scenes
- Discuss how these differences might affect their approach

## Primary and Secondary Survey Role-play
- One student acts as a patient, the other as a first responder
- First responder conducts primary and secondary surveys
- Switch roles and repeat
- Provide feedback to each other

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Scene Safety Checklist Creation
- Students develop a comprehensive scene safety checklist
- Checklist should be applicable to various emergency scenarios in Timor-Leste
- Share and compare checklists, creating a master list as a class

## Triage Decision-Making Practice
- Provide a series of written patient scenarios
- Students individually decide on triage categories and justify their decisions
- Review answers as a class, discussing any discrepancies

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## Three P's Reflection
- Students write a brief reflection on how they applied the "Three P's" during the lesson activities
- Share reflections in small groups or with the whole class

## Emergency Response Charades
- Students act out emergency response actions without speaking
- Class guesses the action and explains its importance
- Serves as a fun review of key concepts

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
- Collect papers to inform future lessons and address remaining questions
