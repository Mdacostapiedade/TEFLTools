# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Emergency Scenario Charades
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group draws a card with an emergency scenario
- Groups act out the scenario without speaking
- Other students guess the emergency and discuss initial response steps

## 2. CPR Rhythm Challenge
- Play different songs with varying beats per minute
- Students practice chest compressions to the rhythm
- Discuss which songs match the ideal CPR rate (100-120 compressions per minute)

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. CPR Technique Stations
- Set up stations for adult, child, and infant CPR
- Students rotate through stations, practicing proper hand placement and compression depth
- Instructors provide feedback and correction at each station

## 2. AED Scavenger Hunt
- Hide parts of the AED trainer around the room
- Students work in teams to find all parts and assemble the AED
- First team to correctly assemble and demonstrate AED use wins

## 3. Rescue Breathing Balloon Challenge
- Provide each student with a balloon
- Students practice rescue breathing technique by inflating the balloon
- Challenge students to maintain consistent breath volume

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. CPR Relay Race
- Divide class into teams
- Set up a course with mannequins at different stations
- Teams perform CPR in relay format, switching team members at each station
- Judge teams on speed and technique accuracy

## 2. Choking Response Role-Play
- Pairs create and act out choking scenarios
- One student plays the victim, the other the responder
- Switch roles and repeat with different scenarios (e.g., conscious adult, unconscious child)

## 3. AED Instruction Manual Creation
- Small groups create a simple, visual AED instruction manual
- Groups present their manuals to the class
- Class votes on the most clear and effective manual

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. CPR Compression Test
- Students perform CPR on a feedback-enabled mannequin
- Practice achieving correct depth and rate for 2 minutes
- Record and review individual performance data

## 2. Virtual Reality First Aid Scenarios (if available)
- Students use VR headsets to practice first aid in various environments
- Complete a series of virtual emergency response scenarios
- Debrief on decision-making process and techniques used

## 3. Rescue Breathing Precision Practice
- Use a breathing bag with volume indicator
- Students practice delivering consistent rescue breaths
- Aim for proper volume and rate over multiple attempts

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. First Aid Jeopardy
- Create a Jeopardy-style game with categories like "CPR Techniques," "AED Use," and "Emergency Assessment"
- Divide class into teams to compete
- Review correct answers and clarify any misunderstandings

## 2. Reflection Circle
- Form a circle with the entire class
- Each student shares one new thing they learned and one area they want to improve
- Instructor provides final thoughts and encouragement

## 3. Emergency Response Visualization
- Guide students through a calm visualization exercise
- Describe various emergency scenarios
- Ask students to mentally rehearse their response steps
- Discuss how visualization can help prepare for real emergencies
