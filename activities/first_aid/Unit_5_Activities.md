# Warm-up Activities

## Environmental Emergency Pictionary
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group receives cards with environmental emergencies written on them
- One student from each group draws the emergency while others guess
- Discuss briefly after each round

## Personal Experience Share
- Students pair up and share a brief personal experience with an environmental hazard in Timor-Leste
- Volunteers share interesting stories with the whole class

# Main Lesson Activities

## Heat Illness Simulation Station
- Set up a station with props (e.g., thermometer, ice packs, water bottles)
- Students rotate through the station, assessing a "patient" with heat exhaustion or heat stroke
- Provide feedback on their assessment and treatment choices

## Water Rescue Roleplay
- Designate an area as "water"
- Students practice the "reach, throw, row, go" technique for water rescue
- Demonstrate and practice rescue breathing on CPR mannequins

## Venomous Creature Identification Challenge
- Display images or models of local venomous snakes and insects
- Students compete to correctly identify the creatures and their potential dangers

# Group Work Tasks

## Community Water Safety Plan
- In small groups, students identify local water hazards (e.g., rivers, beaches)
- Groups develop a safety plan for one specific location, including prevention and rescue strategies
- Present plans to the class for feedback

## Tropical Disease Awareness Campaign
- Assign each group a tropical disease (e.g., malaria, dengue fever)
- Groups create an informative poster or short skit to educate others about symptoms and prevention
- Present campaigns to the class

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Snake Bite First Aid Sequence
- Provide students with cards describing steps for snake bite first aid
- Students arrange the cards in the correct order
- Practice explaining each step as if instructing a victim or bystander

## Heat Illness Assessment Checklist
- Give students a checklist of symptoms for heat exhaustion and heat stroke
- Provide case studies of patients with various symptoms
- Students use the checklist to diagnose each case and suggest appropriate treatment

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## Environmental Emergency Jeopardy
- Create a Jeopardy-style game board with categories like "Heat Illnesses," "Water Safety," "Venomous Creatures," and "Tropical Diseases"
- Students compete in teams to answer questions and reinforce knowledge

## Reflection Circle
- Form a circle with the entire class
- Pass around an object (e.g., a first aid kit item)
- Each student shares one new thing they learned or found interesting from the lesson

## Emergency Response Charades
- Write various environmental emergencies on slips of paper
- Students take turns acting out the emergency response without speaking
- Others guess the emergency and discuss if the response was appropriate
