- Provide scenario cards with different emotional states for the "victims" to portray

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Community Resource Inventory
- In small groups, students create a list of local resources that could be useful in a disaster (e.g., buildings for shelter, water sources, medical facilities)
- Groups share their inventories and compile a master list for the community

## Disaster Preparedness Poster Design
- Pairs create an informative poster on disaster preparedness for a specific audience (e.g., children, elderly, farmers)
- Display posters and have a gallery walk for peer feedback

## Emergency Communication Plan
- Groups develop a communication plan for their community during a disaster
- Plan should include methods for alerting residents, coordinating with authorities, and sharing updates
