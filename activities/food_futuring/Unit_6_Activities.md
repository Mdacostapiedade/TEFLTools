# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Food System Stakeholder Web

- Students stand in a circle
- One student holds a ball of yarn and names a stakeholder in the food system
- They toss the yarn to another student while holding the end
- The next student names another stakeholder and tosses the yarn
- Continue until a web is formed, visually representing the interconnectedness of food system stakeholders

## 2. Participatory Research Myth Busters

- Display common myths about participatory research on slides
- Students use colored cards to vote true or false for each myth
- Discuss the correct answers and why participatory research is important

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. PRA Technique Jigsaw

- Divide class into expert groups, each assigned a PRA technique
- Expert groups research their technique and create a visual aid
- Regroup into mixed teams with one expert from each technique
- Experts teach their technique to their new group

## 2. Ethical Dilemma Scenarios

- Present scenarios involving ethical issues in community-based research
- Small groups discuss and decide how to handle each situation
- Groups present their decisions and reasoning to the class
- Facilitate a discussion on best practices for ethical research

## 3. Data Collection Method Matching

- Create cards with various data collection methods and their descriptions
- Students work in pairs to match the methods with their descriptions
- Discuss which methods are most appropriate for participatory research

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Community Interview Role-Play

- Pairs take turns being the interviewer and community member
- Provide prompt cards with different community roles and issues
- Interviewers practice active listening and appropriate questioning techniques
- Switch roles and repeat

## 2. Participatory Mapping Exercise

- In small groups, create a map of a hypothetical Timorese village
- Include key food system elements (farms, markets, water sources, etc.)
- Groups present their maps and explain how they would use them in participatory research

## 3. Focus Group Simulation

- Assign roles within each group (facilitator, note-taker, participants)
- Provide a food system topic for discussion
- Groups conduct a mock focus group session
- Debrief on challenges and best practices for facilitation

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. PRA Technique Application

- Students choose a food system issue in Timor-Leste
- Design a plan to use one PRA technique to investigate the issue
- Write a brief justification for why the chosen technique is appropriate

## 2. Ethical Consideration Checklist

- Create a checklist of ethical considerations for a participatory research project
- Include items related to informed consent, cultural sensitivity, and data privacy
- Explain the importance of each item on the checklist

## 3. Stakeholder Analysis Worksheet

- Provide a case study of a Timorese food system project
- Students identify key stakeholders and their interests
- Create a stakeholder map showing relationships and power dynamics

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Participatory Research Reflection

- Students write a brief reflection on how participatory research could benefit their own communities
- Share reflections in small groups or with the whole class

## 2. PRA Technique Charades

- Write PRA techniques on slips of paper
- Students take turns acting out a technique without speaking
- Class guesses the technique being demonstrated

## 3. One Word Takeaway

- Students share one word that summarizes their main learning from the lesson
- Create a word cloud with the class responses
- Discuss common themes and key concepts that emerged
