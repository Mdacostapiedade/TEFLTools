Here's a set of engaging activities for the lesson on Foundations of Machine Learning and AI, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Foundations of Machine Learning and AI

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. AI in Daily Life (5 minutes)
- Students write down three examples of AI they've encountered in their daily lives.
- Share and discuss as a class, creating a mind map on the board.

### 2. Machine Learning Pictionary (10 minutes)
- In pairs, students take turns drawing and guessing AI-related concepts (e.g., robot, smart home, self-driving car).
- Discuss how these concepts relate to machine learning.

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Types of Machine Learning Sorting Game (15 minutes)
- Provide students with cards describing various scenarios.
- Students sort the cards into three categories: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
- Discuss the reasoning behind their choices.

### 2. Feature Identification Challenge (20 minutes)
- Present a real-world problem (e.g., predicting crop yields in Timor-Leste).
- Students brainstorm potential features that could be used in a machine learning model.
- Groups present their top 5 features and explain their reasoning.

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. AI Application Brainstorming for Timor-Leste (25 minutes)
- In groups of 3-4, students brainstorm potential AI applications for different sectors in Timor-Leste (e.g., agriculture, healthcare, education).
- Each group creates a poster showcasing their ideas.
- Groups present their posters in a gallery walk format.

### 2. Machine Learning Process Puzzle (20 minutes)
- Provide groups with puzzle pieces representing different steps in the machine learning process (e.g., data collection, feature selection, model training, evaluation).
- Groups arrange the pieces in the correct order and explain each step.

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Linear Regression Hands-on Exercise (30 minutes)
- Students use Jupyter Notebooks to implement a simple linear regression model.
- Use a dataset relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., coffee production vs. rainfall).
- Students train the model, make predictions, and interpret the results.

### 2. AI Ethics Reflection (15 minutes)
- Students write a short reflection on potential ethical concerns of implementing AI in Timor-Leste.
- Encourage them to consider issues like data privacy, job displacement, and cultural impact.

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. One-Minute Paper (5 minutes)
- Students write down:
  1. The most important thing they learned today
  2. One question they still have about machine learning or AI

### 2. AI Future Predictions (10 minutes)
- In pairs, students discuss and write down three predictions for how AI might impact Timor-Leste in the next 10 years.
- Share some predictions with the class and discuss their feasibility and potential impact.

### 3. Machine Learning Concept Map (15 minutes)
- As a class, create a concept map on the board connecting the key terms and ideas learned in the lesson.
- Encourage students to suggest connections and explain their reasoning.

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of the lesson while engaging students through a variety of interactive and reflective tasks. They also incorporate the Timorese context to make the learning more relevant and applicable to the students' lives and future careers.
