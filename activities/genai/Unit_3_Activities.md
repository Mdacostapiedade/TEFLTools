Here's a set of engaging activities for the Natural Language Processing and Word Embeddings lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for NLP and Word Embeddings Lesson

## Warm-up Activities

1. **Word Association Chain**
   - Students stand in a circle. The first student says a word, and the next student must quickly say a related word. Continue around the circle, creating a chain of associated words.
   - Discuss how computers might perform similar word associations.

2. **Language Detective**
   - Show students short texts in different languages (including Tetum and Portuguese). Ask them to identify the languages and explain how they recognized them.
   - Discuss how computers can be trained to identify languages automatically.

## Main Lesson Activities

1. **NLP Task Stations**
   - Set up stations around the classroom, each representing a different NLP task (tokenization, POS tagging, NER, etc.).
   - Students rotate through stations, performing simplified versions of these tasks manually.
   - Discuss how computers automate these processes.

2. **Word Vector Visualization**
   - Use a tool like TensorFlow Projector to visualize word embeddings.
   - Guide students through exploring relationships between words in the vector space.

3. **Analogy Quiz**
   - Present students with word analogies using a pre-trained word embedding model.
   - Students compete to guess the correct word to complete the analogy.

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

1. **NLP Application Brainstorming**
   - In small groups, students brainstorm potential NLP applications for Tetum and Portuguese languages.
   - Groups present their top ideas to the class.

2. **Word Embedding Exploration**
   - In pairs, students use a Jupyter Notebook to explore word similarities and analogies using a pre-trained word embedding model.
   - Pairs share their most interesting findings with the class.

3. **Language Preservation Project**
   - Groups design a hypothetical NLP project to help preserve and promote Timorese languages and culture.
   - Create a brief presentation outlining the project's goals, methods, and potential impact.

## Individual Practice Exercises

1. **Custom Word Embedding**
   - Students create a small corpus of Tetum or Portuguese text and use it to train a simple word embedding model.
   - Analyze the results and compare them to pre-trained models.

2. **NLP Pipeline Design**
   - Design a basic NLP pipeline for a specific task (e.g., sentiment analysis of Tetum social media posts).
   - Outline the steps and components needed for the pipeline.

3. **Word Embedding Math**
   - Provide students with vector representations of words and have them perform vector arithmetic to find analogies.

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

1. **NLP Concept Map**
   - Students create a concept map connecting the key terms and ideas learned in the lesson.
   - Share and compare maps with classmates.

2. **Future of NLP Discussion**
   - Facilitate a brief discussion on the future of NLP, especially in the context of Timor-Leste.
   - What challenges and opportunities do students foresee?

3. **One-Minute Paper**
   - Students write for one minute on the most interesting thing they learned about NLP and word embeddings.
   - Volunteers share their thoughts with the class.

4. **NLP in the News**
   - Show a recent news article about an NLP breakthrough or application.
   - Discuss how it relates to what was learned in the lesson and its potential impact on society.

These activities are designed to reinforce key concepts from the lesson while engaging students through a variety of interactive and thought-provoking tasks. They encourage both individual reflection and collaborative learning, helping students connect the technical aspects of NLP and word embeddings to real-world applications and the local context of Timor-Leste.
