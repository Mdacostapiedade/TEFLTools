Here's a set of engaging activities for the lesson on Generative AI Applications and Use Cases, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Generative AI Applications and Use Cases

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### AI Imagination Game (10 minutes)
- Students form pairs and take turns describing an imaginary AI-generated image to their partner.
- The partner tries to draw the image based on the description.
- After 2-3 rounds, discuss how this relates to image generation AI and the importance of clear prompts.

### AI Application Bingo (15 minutes)
- Create bingo cards with various potential AI applications (e.g., "AI-written news article", "AI-composed music", "AI-designed logo").
- As the instructor describes different generative AI capabilities, students mark off matching items on their cards.
- First student to get a line calls "Bingo!" and explains how each application works.

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### AI Tool Showcase (30 minutes)
- Instructor demonstrates 3-4 different generative AI tools (e.g., GPT-3, DALL-E, GitHub Copilot).
- For each tool, show a practical example relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., generating a tourism brochure text, creating an image for a public health campaign).
- Encourage students to ask questions and suggest potential uses after each demonstration.

### Sector Impact Analysis (25 minutes)
- Divide the class into groups, each assigned a different sector (e.g., education, agriculture, healthcare).
- Groups brainstorm and create a mind map of potential generative AI applications in their sector.
- Each group presents their ideas to the class, followed by a brief discussion.

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### AI Solution Design Challenge (45 minutes)
- In small groups, students identify a specific challenge in Timor-Leste.
- Groups design a generative AI solution to address the challenge, considering:
  1. The specific AI technology they would use
  2. How it would be implemented
  3. Potential benefits and drawbacks
- Groups create a poster or digital presentation to share their ideas.

### Prompt Engineering Workshop (30 minutes)
- In pairs, students experiment with a text generation AI tool.
- Provide a list of tasks relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., "Create a slogan for a eco-tourism campaign", "Write a short story incorporating Timorese folklore").
- Pairs compete to create the most effective prompts for each task, sharing their best results with the class.

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### AI Tool Exploration (20 minutes)
- Students individually explore one of the demonstrated AI tools.
- They complete a worksheet documenting:
  1. The tool's capabilities
  2. Three potential applications in Timor-Leste
  3. Any limitations or challenges they observed

### Ethical Consideration Reflection (15 minutes)
- Students write a short reflection on the ethical implications of one generative AI application they've learned about.
- They should consider both potential benefits and risks for Timorese society.

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### AI Application Gallery Walk (20 minutes)
- Display the posters/presentations from the AI Solution Design Challenge around the room.
- Students do a "gallery walk," leaving post-it note feedback or questions on each project.
- Conclude with a brief class discussion on the most innovative or impactful ideas.

### Future Vision Sharing Circle (15 minutes)
- Students sit in a circle and take turns sharing one way they envision generative AI positively impacting Timor-Leste in the next 5-10 years.
- Encourage students to build on each other's ideas.
- Instructor summarizes key themes and reinforces main lesson concepts.

These activities are designed to be engaging, interactive, and relevant to the lesson content on generative AI applications and use cases, with a focus on the Timor-Leste context.
