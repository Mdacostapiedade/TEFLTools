Here's a set of engaging activities for the lesson on Prompt Engineering and Effective Use of LLMs, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Prompt Engineering and LLM Use

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### Prompt Improvement Race
- Divide the class into pairs
- Each pair receives a poorly written prompt
- Set a timer for 5 minutes
- Pairs compete to improve the prompt as much as possible
- Share and vote on the best improvements

### AI Charades
- Prepare cards with AI-related terms (e.g., "prompt engineering," "few-shot learning")
- Students take turns drawing a card and describing the term without using the word itself
- Other students guess the term

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Prompt Component Puzzle
- Create a set of prompt components (instructions, context, input, output format) on separate cards
- Students work in small groups to assemble effective prompts using these components
- Groups share their prompts and explain their choices

### LLM Response Analysis
- Provide students with a series of prompts and their corresponding LLM outputs
- Students analyze the effectiveness of each prompt and suggest improvements
- Class discussion on what makes certain prompts more effective than others

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Prompt Engineering Challenge
- Divide the class into small groups
- Assign each group a specific task relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., creating a tourism chatbot, generating educational content in Tetum)
- Groups collaborate to create a series of prompts for their assigned task
- Groups test their prompts and refine them based on the results

### Few-Shot Learning Workshop
- Pairs of students work together to create few-shot learning prompts
- Provide a list of tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification)
- Each pair develops prompts with 2-3 examples for their chosen task
- Pairs exchange prompts and test them, providing feedback to each other

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Prompt Refinement Journal
- Students start with a basic prompt for a specific task
- They iteratively refine the prompt over 5-6 attempts, documenting each change and its impact
- Students write a short reflection on their refinement process and what they learned

### Cross-Domain Prompt Creation
- Provide students with a list of different domains (e.g., healthcare, education, agriculture)
- Students individually create prompts that apply a concept from one domain to solve a problem in another
- Share creative cross-domain applications with the class

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### Prompt Engineering Tips Gallery Walk
- Students write their top prompt engineering tips on large sheets of paper
- Hang these sheets around the room
- Students walk around, reading others' tips and adding comments or questions
- Conclude with a class discussion on the most valuable tips

### AI Assistant Roleplay
- In pairs, one student plays the role of an AI assistant, the other a user
- The user asks questions or gives tasks related to Timor-Leste
- The "AI" responds based on their understanding of prompt engineering principles
- Switch roles and discuss the experience as a class

### Prompt Engineering Reflection Circle
- Form a circle with the entire class
- Pass around an object (e.g., a small globe or AI-related item)
- When holding the object, each student shares one key insight they gained about prompt engineering or one way they plan to use this skill in the future

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of prompt engineering and effective use of LLMs while keeping students engaged and encouraging both collaborative and individual learning. They also incorporate relevant contexts for Timor-Leste to make the learning more applicable to the students' experiences.
