# Engaging Activities for Ethical Considerations and Societal Impact of AI

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### AI Ethics Bingo
- Create bingo cards with ethical AI terms and concepts
- Read out definitions or examples, and students mark their cards
- First to complete a line wins and explains the concepts in that line

### Ethical Dilemma Quick-fire

- Central theme: "AI in Timor-Leste"
- Branches: Economic, Social, Cultural, Environmental impacts
- Groups present their mind maps to the class

### Ethical AI Design Challenge
- Divide class into teams
- Each team designs an AI system for a specific sector in Timor-Leste (e.g., healthcare, agriculture)
- Teams must incorporate ethical considerations into their design
- Present designs in a "pitch" format to the class

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### AI Policy Debate
- Divide class into pairs or small groups
- Assign each group a specific AI policy issue (e.g., data privacy, algorithmic transparency)
- Groups research and prepare arguments for and against the policy
- Conduct a structured debate between groups

### Ethical AI Scenario Analysis
- Provide groups with detailed AI implementation scenarios in Timor-Leste
- Groups analyze potential ethical issues and societal impacts
- Create a risk assessment matrix for each scenario
- Present findings to the class

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### AI Ethics Journal
- Students maintain a personal journal throughout the lesson
- Reflect on ethical dilemmas, personal opinions, and changing perspectives
- Include prompts for critical thinking about AI's impact on Timorese society

### Ethical AI Decision Tree
- Students create a decision tree for ethical AI implementation
- Include key questions and considerations at each decision point
- Apply the decision tree to a hypothetical AI project in Timor-Leste

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### AI Ethics Fishbowl Discussion
- Arrange chairs in two circles (inner and outer)
- Inner circle discusses a key ethical issue, outer circle observes
- Participants can "tap in" to join the inner circle discussion
- Debrief on the main points and insights gained

### Future Headlines Activity
- Students write newspaper headlines from 5 years in the future
- Headlines should reflect potential outcomes of AI adoption in Timor-Leste
- Share headlines and vote on the most likely and most impactful ones

### Ethical AI Pledge

- Include key principles and commitments for responsible AI development
- Discuss how this pledge could be implemented in reality

These activities are designed to be engaging, interactive, and reinforce the key concepts of ethical considerations and societal impact of AI in the context of Timor-Leste. They encourage critical thinking, collaboration, and practical application of the lesson content.
