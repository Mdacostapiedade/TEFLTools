# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Jigsaw Reading

- Outer circle observes and takes notes, then switches places for a new round of discussion

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Comparative Analysis
- In pairs, analyze a passage from the Secret Book of James alongside a related New Testament passage
- Create a Venn diagram showing similarities and differences in teachings
- Share findings with another pair, discussing implications of the differences

## 2. Modern Interpretation Skit
- Small groups choose a teaching from the text and create a short skit
- Skit should demonstrate how the teaching might be interpreted or applied in modern Timorese society
- Perform skits for the class, followed by brief discussion

## 3. Debate Preparation
- Divide class into groups representing different perspectives (e.g., Gnostic, Orthodox Christian, secular historian)
- Groups prepare arguments for a debate on the value and validity of the Secret Book of James
- Conduct a structured debate, with groups presenting their positions and responding to others
