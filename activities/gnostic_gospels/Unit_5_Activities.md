# Warm-up Activities

## Creation Story Sharing Circle
- Students sit in a circle and take turns sharing brief creation stories from their cultural backgrounds or families.
- After each story, the class identifies one unique element and one common theme.

## Cosmic Pictionary
- Divide the class into teams.
- Each team takes turns drawing key terms (e.g., Pleroma, Demiurge, Archons) while others guess.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Cosmology Construction
- Using large sheets of paper and markers, students create visual representations of the Secret Book of John's cosmology.
- Groups present their diagrams, explaining the relationships between different entities.

## Character Hot Seat
- Assign roles (e.g., Sophia, Yaldabaoth, the invisible Spirit) to volunteers.
- Other students ask questions to these "characters" about their roles in the creation myth.

## Comparative Timeline
- Create a large timeline on the board comparing events in the Secret Book of John and Genesis.
- Students add events to the timeline and discuss similarities and differences.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Concept Mapping
- In pairs, students create concept maps linking key ideas (e.g., Sophia, fall, creation, humanity).
- Pairs join to form groups of four and combine their maps, discussing any differences.

## Debate Preparation
- Divide the class into groups representing different perspectives (e.g., Gnostic, Orthodox Christian, Traditional Timorese).
- Groups prepare arguments about the nature of good and evil based on their assigned perspective.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Reflective Journaling
- Students write personal reflections on how the Secret Book of John's concepts of good and evil relate to their own beliefs or experiences.

## Vocabulary Application
- Provide a list of key terms and ask students to write sentences using each term in the context of the Secret Book of John.

## Creative Writing
- Students write a short story or poem incorporating elements from the Secret Book of John's cosmology.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Question Ball
- Write review questions on a beach ball.
- Toss the ball around the class; the catcher answers the question their right thumb lands on.

## Exit Ticket
- Students write on a slip of paper:
  1. One thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
  3. One way the lesson connects to their life or beliefs

## Visual Synthesis
- As a class, create a collective mind map on the board, with students adding connections between concepts from the lesson.
