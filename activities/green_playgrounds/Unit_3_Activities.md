# Warm-up Activities

## Urban Flooding Photo Analysis
1. Display a series of photos showing urban flooding in Timorese cities.
2. In pairs, students discuss:
   - Causes of the flooding
   - Impacts on the community
   - Potential solutions

## Stormwater Pathway Tracing
1. Provide students with a simple map of a Timorese neighborhood.
2. Ask them to trace the path rainwater would take from rooftops to streets to storm drains.
3. Discuss how this pathway contributes to flooding and pollution.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Urban Hydrology Demonstration
1. Set up a simple model of an urban area using a large tray, impermeable materials (for buildings and roads), and permeable materials (for green spaces).
2. Pour water over the model to simulate rainfall.
3. Observe and discuss how water moves through the urban landscape.

## Green Infrastructure Techniques Gallery Walk
1. Create posters around the room, each describing a different green infrastructure technique.
2. Students move from poster to poster, taking notes on each technique's benefits and potential applications in Timor-Leste.

## Runoff Reduction Calculation Workshop
1. Provide data on a hypothetical green infrastructure project.
2. Guide students through the process of calculating stormwater runoff reduction using simple formulas.
3. Discuss how these calculations can inform project planning and design.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Green Infrastructure Opportunity Mapping
1. In small groups, provide local maps and aerial imagery of a Timorese neighborhood.
2. Groups identify potential locations for various green infrastructure interventions.
3. Groups present their ideas to the class, justifying their choices.

## Neighborhood Stormwater Management Plan
1. Assign each group a different neighborhood scenario.
2. Groups analyze current stormwater issues and propose green infrastructure solutions.
3. Groups create a simple map of their interventions and estimate potential runoff reduction.
4. Each group presents their plan to the class for feedback.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Green Infrastructure Design Sketch
1. Provide students with a description of a specific urban site (e.g., a parking lot, school grounds).
2. Students individually sketch a green infrastructure design for the site.
3. Students write a brief explanation of their design choices and expected benefits.

## Stormwater Management Quiz
Create a quiz covering key concepts from the lesson, including:
- Definitions of key terms
- Matching green infrastructure techniques to their primary functions
- Calculating simple runoff volumes
- Identifying appropriate green infrastructure for given scenarios

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Green Infrastructure Bingo
1. Create bingo cards with various green infrastructure techniques and benefits.
2. Call out descriptions or scenarios.
3. Students mark off matching items on their cards.
4. Discuss each item as it's called to reinforce learning.

## One-Minute Paper
Ask students to write for one minute on:
- The most important thing they learned today
- One question they still have about green infrastructure or stormwater management

## Stormwater Management Pictionary
1. Divide the class into teams.
2. Teams take turns drawing and guessing key terms or concepts from the lesson.
3. Award points for correct guesses and discuss each term after it's revealed.
