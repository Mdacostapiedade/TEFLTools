# Warm-up Activities

## Urban Park Transformation Gallery Walk
- Display before and after images of urban parks around the room
- Students walk around, observing the changes and writing notes on:
  * What green infrastructure elements they notice
  * Potential benefits of the transformations
- Discuss observations as a class

## Climate Change Impact Brainstorm
- In small groups, students brainstorm potential climate change impacts on urban parks
- Groups share ideas on a collaborative digital whiteboard
- Class discusses how green infrastructure could address these impacts

# Main Lesson Activities

## Green Infrastructure Bingo
- Create bingo cards with various green infrastructure elements
- As each element is discussed in the lesson, students mark it on their card
- First to get a line wins a small prize related to sustainability

## Virtual Park Design Tour
- Use Google Earth or a similar tool to virtually tour exemplary green infrastructure parks worldwide
- Students take notes on design elements and their functions

## Ecosystem Services Matching Game
- Create cards with green infrastructure elements and ecosystem services
- Students match the elements to the services they provide
- Discuss the multiple benefits of each element

# Group Work Tasks

## Park Redesign Challenge
- Divide class into small groups
- Assign each group a local park to redesign
- Provide maps, climate data, and community needs information
- Groups brainstorm and sketch initial redesign concepts
- Present ideas to the class for feedback

## Green Infrastructure Debate
- Assign groups different stakeholder roles (e.g., city planner, environmentalist, developer)
- Present a scenario for implementing green infrastructure in a park
- Groups debate the pros and cons from their stakeholder perspective

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Design Software Tutorial
- Provide a step-by-step tutorial for using design software to create green infrastructure elements
- Students practice creating individual elements like bioswales or rain gardens

## Plant Selection Activity
- Provide a list of native plants and their characteristics
- Students select appropriate plants for different green infrastructure elements, considering local climate and ecosystem needs

## Stormwater Calculation Exercise
- Give students data on rainfall and park area
- Students calculate potential stormwater capture using different green infrastructure techniques

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 3-2-1 Reflection
- Students write down:
  * 3 things they learned
  * 2 questions they still have
  * 1 way they could apply this knowledge in their community

## Green Infrastructure Pictionary
- Students take turns drawing green infrastructure elements while others guess
- Reinforces visual understanding of concepts

## Future Park Vision
- Students write a short paragraph describing their vision for climate-resilient parks in their city 20 years from now
- Share visions in pairs or small groups
