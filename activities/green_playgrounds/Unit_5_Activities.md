# Warm-up Activities

## Coastal Change Gallery Walk
1. Set up stations around the room with before and after images of coastal flooding events in Southeast Asia.
2. Students move in pairs from station to station, discussing:
   - What changes do you observe?
   - What might have caused these changes?
   - How might these changes impact coastal communities?
3. After viewing all stations, conduct a brief class discussion on observations.

## Sea Level Rise Visualization
1. Mark a line on the classroom wall representing current sea level.
2. Ask students to predict where sea level might be in 2050 and 2100 based on projections for Timor-Leste.
3. Mark these levels and discuss the potential impacts on coastal areas.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Sea Level Rise Impact Mapping
1. Provide students with maps of a coastal area in Timor-Leste and sea level rise projections.
2. Students use colored pencils to shade areas that would be impacted by different levels of sea rise.
3. Discuss the implications for infrastructure, communities, and ecosystems.

## Green Infrastructure Solutions Showcase
1. Create stations around the room, each representing a different green infrastructure solution (e.g., living shorelines, coastal wetlands, green-gray infrastructure).
2. Students rotate through stations, reading about each solution and its benefits.
3. At each station, students brainstorm how this solution could be applied in Timor-Leste.

## Case Study Analysis
1. Present 2-3 case studies of successful coastal green infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia.
2. For each case study, students complete a worksheet analyzing:
   - The problem addressed
   - The solution implemented
   - The outcomes and benefits
   - Potential application in Timor-Leste

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Coastal Vulnerability Assessment
1. Divide students into small groups and provide each with a map of a different coastal town in Timor-Leste.
2. Groups identify and mark areas at risk from sea level rise and coastal flooding.
3. Groups present their assessments to the class, explaining their reasoning.

## Green Infrastructure Design Challenge
1. Assign each group a specific coastal challenge (e.g., erosion, flooding, storm surge protection).
2. Groups brainstorm and sketch a green infrastructure solution for their assigned challenge.
3. Groups present their designs to the class, explaining how their solution addresses the challenge.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Coastal Resilience Concept Map
Students create individual concept maps linking key terms and ideas related to coastal resilience and green infrastructure.

## Green Infrastructure Benefits Analysis
Provide students with a description of a green infrastructure project. They individually write a short essay analyzing the environmental, social, and economic benefits of the project.

## Case Study Research
Students individually research and write a one-page summary of a coastal green infrastructure project from another country, analyzing its applicability to Timor-Leste.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Green Infrastructure Pictionary
1. Create cards with key terms related to coastal resilience and green infrastructure.
2. Students take turns drawing the concepts while their teammates guess.

## Reflection Journal
Students spend 5-10 minutes writing in a reflection journal, considering:
- What was the most surprising thing you learned today?
- How might today's lesson impact your community in the future?
- What questions do you still have about coastal resilience and green infrastructure?

## One-Minute Paper
Students have one minute to write down the most important concept they learned in the lesson and one question they still have.
