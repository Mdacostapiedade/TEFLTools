# Warm-up Activities

## Policy Pictionary
- Divide the class into small groups
- Each group receives a green infrastructure policy concept to draw (e.g., "tax incentive", "zoning ordinance")
- Groups take turns drawing their concept while others guess
- Discuss how each concept relates to green infrastructure implementation

## Barrier Brainstorm Race
- Split the class into teams
- Set a 2-minute timer
- Teams race to list as many barriers to green infrastructure implementation as possible
- Share and discuss lists, categorizing barriers into themes (e.g., financial, regulatory, social)

# Main Lesson Activities

## Policy Approach Jigsaw
- Divide class into "expert groups" focusing on different policy approaches (regulatory, incentive-based, planning integration)
- Expert groups research their approach and prepare to teach others
- Regroup into "learning teams" with one expert from each approach
- Experts teach their approach to their learning team
- Teams create a mind map combining all approaches

## Case Study Analysis Carousel
- Set up stations around the room with different case studies of green infrastructure policies
- Small groups rotate through stations, spending 5-10 minutes at each
- Groups analyze strengths and challenges of each policy approach
- After rotating through all stations, facilitate a whole-class discussion on key findings

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Policy Adaptation Workshop
- Pairs or small groups receive a successful green infrastructure policy from another country
- Groups identify elements that could work in Timor-Leste and those that need adaptation
- Create a proposal for how to adapt the policy for local implementation
- Present proposals to the class for feedback

## Funding Mechanism Matchmaking
- Provide cards with various green infrastructure projects and funding mechanisms
- Groups match projects with appropriate funding sources
- Discuss rationale for matches and potential challenges

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Policy Brief Drafting
- Students individually draft a 1-page policy brief recommending green infrastructure measures for a local government in Timor-Leste
- Include problem statement, policy recommendation, implementation strategy, and potential funding sources
- Peer review in pairs, providing constructive feedback

## Incentive Program Design
- Each student designs an incentive program to encourage green infrastructure adoption in a specific sector (e.g., residential, commercial, institutional)
- Create a one-page flyer explaining the program and its benefits

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Implementation Strategy Gallery Walk
- Students post their policy briefs or incentive program designs around the room
- Conduct a gallery walk where students review each other's work
- Use sticky notes to leave comments or questions
- Discuss common themes and innovative ideas as a class

## Reflection Roundtable
- Form small groups to discuss:
  1. Most surprising thing learned about green infrastructure policy
  2. Biggest challenge for implementation in Timor-Leste
  3. One policy approach they're excited to explore further
- Share key points from each group with the class

## Policy Approach Spectrum
- Create a spectrum on the floor from "Highly Regulatory" to "Purely Incentive-Based"
- Read out different policy approaches
- Students physically position themselves on the spectrum based on where they think the approach falls
- Discuss reasons for positions and potential pros and cons of each approach
