# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Community Engagement Bingo

- Create a bingo card with squares containing different community engagement experiences (e.g., "Attended a town hall meeting", "Signed a petition", "Volunteered for a local project")
- Students mingle and find classmates who have had these experiences, marking off squares
- First to complete a line wins, then discuss the most common and uncommon experiences

## 2. Stakeholder Perspective Shuffle

- Write different stakeholder roles on cards (e.g., resident, business owner, environmentalist, city planner)
- Students draw a card and form groups based on their role
- Each group discusses a local issue from their stakeholder perspective
- Groups then mix, forming new groups with diverse perspectives to discuss the same issue

# Main Lesson Activities

## 3. Participatory Design Method Carousel

- Set up stations around the room, each featuring a different participatory design method
- Small groups rotate through stations, spending 5-7 minutes at each
- At each station, groups read about the method and brainstorm how it could be applied to a local green infrastructure project
- Groups share their favorite method and application with the class

## 4. Equity Mapping Exercise

- Provide a large map of a local area and demographic data
- Students use colored pins or stickers to mark different socio-economic factors (e.g., income levels, vulnerable populations)
- Overlay potential green infrastructure project locations
- Analyze and discuss the equity implications of project placement

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 5. Community Engagement Strategy Development

- In pairs or small groups, students develop a community engagement strategy for a hypothetical green infrastructure project
- Groups must include at least three participatory design methods and address potential challenges
- Each group presents their strategy to another group for peer feedback

## 6. Stakeholder Role-Play Debate

- Assign groups different stakeholder roles for a controversial green infrastructure project
- Groups prepare arguments from their stakeholder perspective
- Conduct a structured debate, with groups presenting their views and responding to others
- Debrief on how to balance different stakeholder needs in project design

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 7. Digital Engagement Tool Exploration

- Provide a list of digital engagement tools (e.g., online surveys, social media platforms, participatory mapping software)
- Students individually research one tool and create a one-page summary of its features, benefits, and potential applications for green infrastructure projects
- Share findings in a gallery walk format

## 8. Reflection Journal: Personal Engagement Experience

- Students write a reflective journal entry about a personal experience with community engagement or participatory design
- Prompt them to consider what made the experience positive or negative, and how it could inform their approach to future green infrastructure projects

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 9. Participatory Design Method Matchmaking

- Create cards with different green infrastructure projects and participatory design methods
- Students draw one of each and quickly explain how they would apply that method to that project
- Discuss as a class which matches seem most effective and why

## 10. Community Engagement Commitment

- Students write down one specific action they commit to taking to improve community engagement in their future work
- Share commitments in a closing circle
- Optional: Create a class "engagement pledge" combining key commitments
