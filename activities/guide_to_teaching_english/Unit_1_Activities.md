# Engaging Activities for Introduction to English Language Teaching

## 1. Warm-up Activities

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Policy Jigsaw

- Groups become "experts" on their section and teach others
- Create a collaborative mind map of key policy points

### Communicative vs. Traditional Teaching Debate
- Divide class into two teams: one supporting communicative teaching, the other traditional methods
- Teams prepare arguments and engage in a structured debate
- Debrief by synthesizing the strengths of both approaches

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Communicative Activity Design Challenge
- In small groups, students design a communicative activity for young learners
- Must incorporate Timorese culture and be suitable for large classes
- Groups present their activities and class votes on the most effective

### Lesson Plan Makeover
- Pairs receive a traditional, grammar-focused lesson plan
- Task: Revise the plan to incorporate communicative elements
- Share revised plans and discuss changes made

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Reflective Journal Entry
- Students write a personal reflection on their ideal English classroom
- Consider aspects like physical setup, teaching methods, and materials
- Include how this ideal incorporates communicative principles

### Self-Assessment Checklist
- Provide a checklist of communicative teaching principles
- Students rate their current understanding and comfort level with each principle
- Identify areas for personal growth and development

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### Three-Two-One Reflection
- Students write down:
  - 3 things they learned
  - 2 questions they still have
  - 1 way they'll apply this knowledge in their teaching
- Share in small groups or with the whole class

### Commitment Cards
- Students write one specific commitment to incorporating communicative teaching in their practice
- Post cards on a shared board or wall
- Revisit commitments in future sessions to track progress

These activities are designed to be interactive, reflective, and relevant to the Timorese context, helping to reinforce the key concepts of the lesson while engaging students in meaningful learning experiences.
