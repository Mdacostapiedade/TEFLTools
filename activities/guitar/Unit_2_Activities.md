# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Guitar Simon Says (5 minutes)
- Students follow the teacher's instructions only when prefaced with "Simon says"
- Include guitar-related actions like "strum down," "form A chord," "wiggle your fretting fingers"

## 2. Finger Gym (3 minutes)
- Students perform finger exercises to warm up their hands:
  * Spider walks: Walk fingers up and down the fretboard
  * Finger taps: Tap each finger on a flat surface in sequence
  * Wrist rotations: Rotate wrists in circles

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Chord Formation Race (10 minutes)
- Divide the class into small groups
- Call out a chord (A, D, or E)
- Groups race to have all members form the chord correctly
- First group to achieve this gets a point

## 2. Strumming Pattern Mimic (8 minutes)
- Teacher demonstrates various strumming patterns using only downstrokes
- Students mimic the patterns, starting slowly and gradually increasing speed

## 3. Chord Progression Hot Potato (12 minutes)
- Students sit in a circle, each with a guitar
- Play a Timorese folk song and pause it randomly
- The student holding the "hot potato" (a small object passed around) must name the next chord in the progression

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Chord Change Challenge (15 minutes)
- In pairs, students take turns being the "caller" and the "player"
- The caller names chords (A, D, E) in random order
- The player must switch to the called chord as quickly and accurately as possible
- Partners switch roles after 2 minutes

## 2. Timorese Song Deconstruction (20 minutes)
- In small groups, students listen to a simple Timorese folk song
- Groups work together to identify the chords used and create a basic chord chart
- Each group presents their findings to the class

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Chord Accuracy Check (10 minutes)
- Students practice forming each chord (A, D, E) individually
- They use their phones or a tuner to check if all strings are ringing clearly
- Goal: Achieve clear sound for each chord five times in a row

## 2. Metronome Challenge (8 minutes)
- Set a metronome to a slow tempo
- Students practice switching between chords in time with the metronome
- Gradually increase the tempo as students improve

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Musical Telephone (10 minutes)
- Students sit in a circle
- The first student plays a simple 4-beat rhythm using one chord
- The next student must repeat the rhythm and add their own 4 beats
- Continue around the circle, creating a longer sequence

## 2. Reflection Circle (5 minutes)
- Students form a circle and take turns sharing:
  * One thing they learned today
  * One thing they want to practice more
  * One thing they're excited about for the next lesson
