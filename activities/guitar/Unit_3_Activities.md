# Engaging Activities for Reading Chord Charts and Tablature Lesson

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Chord Relay Race
- Divide the class into two teams
- Each team lines up in front of a whiteboard
- Call out a chord name (A, D, or E)
- The first student in each line runs to the board and draws the chord chart
- Teams earn points for speed and accuracy

### 2. Musical Simon Says
- Play "Simon Says" with guitar-related actions
- Include commands like "Simon says form an A chord" or "Simon says strum once"
- Students who perform incorrect actions or actions without "Simon says" are out

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Chord Chart Bingo
- Create bingo cards with various chord charts
- Call out chord names
- Students mark off the corresponding chord charts on their cards
- First to get a line or full house wins

### 2. Tab Treasure Hunt
- Hide pieces of paper with short tablature snippets around the room
- Students search for the snippets and try to play them
- Discuss and demonstrate correct interpretations as a class

### 3. Chord Progression Puzzle
- Provide students with a set of chord chart cards
- Call out a chord progression (e.g., Am-C-G-D)
- Students arrange their cards in the correct order
- Play the progression together as a class

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Tab Translation Teams
- In pairs, give students a simple melody written in standard notation
- Have them work together to translate it into tablature
- Compare results with other pairs and discuss any differences

### 2. Chord Chart Creation Challenge
- In small groups, assign each team a chord to create a chart for
- Groups design their own chord chart on a large piece of paper
- Present charts to the class and explain their design choices

### 3. Tab-and-Tell
- In pairs, one student plays a short tablature excerpt
- The other student listens and tries to write it down in tab notation
- Switch roles and repeat

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Chord Chart Speed Drills
- Display a series of chord charts on the projector
- Students form each chord as quickly and accurately as possible
- Gradually increase the speed of transitions between chords

### 2. Tab Sight-Reading Challenge
- Provide students with progressively difficult tablature excerpts
- Set a timer for each excerpt (e.g., 30 seconds)
- Students attempt to sight-read and play as much as possible in the given time

### 3. Chord-Tab Integration Exercise
- Give students a worksheet with alternating chord charts and tablature
- Students play through the entire sequence, switching between chords and single notes

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. Musical Telephone
- Sit in a circle with guitars
- First person plays a short phrase using a chord or tablature
- Next person tries to replicate it, then adds their own short phrase
- Continue around the circle, with each person repeating and adding

### 2. Chord Chart Pictionary

- One student from each team comes to the board
- Show them a chord name
- They race to draw the chord chart while their team tries to guess the chord

### 3. Tab Tunes Guessing Game
- Play simple Timorese melodies from tablature
