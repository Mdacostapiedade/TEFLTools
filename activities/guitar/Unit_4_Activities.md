# Warm-up Activities

## Chord Transition Race
- Students form a circle and take turns transitioning between A, D, and E chords as quickly as possible
- Teacher calls out chord changes, increasing speed gradually

## Finger Gym
- Students "spider walk" their fingers up and down the fretboard to warm up
- Practice finger independence by tapping each finger on the fretboard in sequence

# Main Lesson Activities

## Finger Assignment Game
- Students place colored stickers on their fingernails corresponding to string assignments
- Teacher calls out string numbers, students raise the correct finger

## Bass Line Bounce
- Students practice the alternating bass pattern on A chord to a metronome
- Gradually increase tempo as students become comfortable

## Pattern Progression
- Students learn the p, i, m, a pattern on open strings
- Progress to playing the pattern on A, D, and E chords
- Teacher demonstrates how the pattern sounds in a simple song

# Group Work / Pair Work Tasks

## Fingerpicking Duet
- In pairs, one student plays alternating bass while the other plays melody notes
- Switch roles and repeat

## Pattern Telephone
- In groups of 4-5, the first student creates a simple fingerpicking pattern
- Each student tries to replicate and pass on the pattern to the next person
- Compare the final pattern to the original

# Individual Practice Exercises

## String Skipping Challenge
- Students practice moving between non-adjacent strings in a fingerpicking pattern
- Start slow and gradually increase speed

## Melody Mapping
- Provide a simple Timorese melody written in tablature
- Students figure out how to play it using the fingerpicking technique learned

## Chord Progression Fingerpicking
- Students apply the learned fingerpicking pattern to a I-IV-V chord progression in A (A-D-E)

# Cool-down / Wrap-up Activities

## Fingerpicking Circle
- Form a circle and play a simple fingerpicking pattern together
- Each student takes turns adding a small variation to the pattern

## Relaxation and Reflection
- Students gently massage their fingertips and reflect on what they've learned
- Share one thing they found challenging and one thing they enjoyed about fingerpicking

## Mini-Performance
- Volunteers perform a short section of a song using the new fingerpicking technique
- Class provides supportive feedback and observations
