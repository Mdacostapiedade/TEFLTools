# Warm-up Activities

## Musical Chairs Chord Challenge
- Arrange chairs in a circle, one fewer than the number of students
- Play Timorese music and have students walk around the chairs
- When the music stops, students sit and play a specified chord
- Last student to play correctly is out; remove another chair
- Continue until one winner remains

## Rhythm Circle
- Students stand in a circle, passing a steady beat by clapping
- Introduce simple rhythmic patterns for students to repeat
- Gradually increase complexity, incorporating body percussion

# Main Lesson Activities

## Song Structure Scavenger Hunt
- Divide class into small groups
- Provide each group with lyrics to different Timorese songs
- Groups identify and label verses, choruses, and bridges
- Present findings to the class, explaining their reasoning

## Performance Technique Stations
- Set up stations around the room focusing on different techniques:
  1. Posture and guitar holding
  2. Eye contact and audience engagement
  3. Strumming confidence
  4. Vocal projection
- Students rotate through stations, practicing each technique

# Group Work Tasks

## Song Structure Remix
- In small groups, students take a simple Timorese song
- Groups rearrange the song structure (e.g., change order of verses, add a bridge)
- Perform the remixed version for the class

## Mini-Concert Planning
- Divide class into "bands" of 3-4 students
- Each band chooses a Timorese song to perform
- Groups plan their performance, including stage positions and movements
- Perform for the class, focusing on stage presence and song structure

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Performance Journal
- Students record themselves performing a short section of a song
- Watch the recording and write reflections on their performance
- Set personal goals for improvement in specific areas

## Structure Sketching
- Provide students with a new Timorese song (audio and lyrics)
- Individually, students sketch out the song structure on paper
- Compare sketches with a partner, discussing any differences

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## Musical Telephone
- Students sit in a circle
- First student plays a short musical phrase
- Next student attempts to repeat and add to the phrase
- Continue around the circle, building a collaborative melody

## Reflection Riff
- Each student shares one thing they learned about song structure or performance
- After sharing, they play a short riff or chord progression
- Class repeats the riff together before moving to the next student

## Stage Presence Freeze Frame
- Students move around the room to music
- When music stops, strike a "rock star" pose demonstrating good stage presence
- Discuss and critique poses as a class
