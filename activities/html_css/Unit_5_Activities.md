- Discuss the importance of cross-browser compatibility

# Main Lesson Activities

## Validation Station
- Provide students with a set of HTML and CSS files containing various errors
- Teach them how to use W3C validators
- Have students validate the files and create a list of errors found
- Guide them through the process of fixing these errors

## Performance Profiling
- Introduce students to browser developer tools for performance analysis
- Demonstrate how to use the Network tab to analyze page load times
- Have students profile a given website and identify potential performance bottlenecks

## Standards Compliance Checklist
- Create a comprehensive web standards compliance checklist as a class
- Include items related to HTML structure, CSS best practices, accessibility, and performance
- Have students use this checklist to evaluate a sample website

# Group Work Tasks

## Website Audit Team
- Divide the class into small groups
- Assign each group a different Timorese government or popular local website
- Task: Conduct a comprehensive audit covering HTML/CSS validation, cross-browser compatibility, and performance
- Groups prepare and present their findings to the class

## Browser Compatibility Testing Squad
- Assign each group a different set of browsers (including mobile browsers)
- Provide a test website with known compatibility issues
- Groups must identify and document all compatibility problems
- Challenge groups to propose solutions for the issues they find

# Individual Practice Exercises

- Create a Jeopardy-style game with categories like "HTML5 Features", "CSS Best Practices", "Performance Boosters", and "Accessibility Musts"
- Play as a class to review key concepts from the lesson

## Reflection and Goal Setting
- Students write a brief reflection on what they learned about web standards and best practices
- Ask them to set three specific goals for improving their own web development practices
- Share goals with a partner for accountability

## Best Practices Poster
- In small groups, create informative posters about web standards and best practices
- Topics could include "Top 10 Performance Tips", "Accessibility Checklist", or "Cross-Browser Compatibility Guide"
