# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Wisdom Circle (15 minutes)
- Students form a circle and take turns sharing a piece of wisdom or knowledge they learned from an elder in their family or community.
- After each share, the group discusses how this knowledge might be relevant to urban planning and development.

## 2. Generational Timeline (10 minutes)
- Create a large timeline on the whiteboard representing the last 100 years.
- Students add sticky notes to the timeline with major urban developments or changes they've heard about from different generations in their family.
- Discuss how the urban landscape has evolved over time and the importance of preserving intergenerational knowledge.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Elder Engagement Strategies Brainstorm (20 minutes)
- In small groups, students brainstorm and list various strategies for engaging elders in urban planning processes.
- Groups share their ideas with the class, and the teacher compiles a master list on the whiteboard.
- Discuss the pros and cons of each strategy and how they might be implemented in Timor-Leste.

## 2. Case Study Analysis (30 minutes)
- Provide students with a case study of a successful intergenerational urban planning project from another country.
- Students read and analyze the case study, identifying key factors that contributed to its success.
- Facilitate a class discussion on how similar approaches could be adapted for Timor-Leste.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Intergenerational Community Forum Planning (45 minutes)
- In groups of 4-5, students develop a detailed plan for organizing an intergenerational community forum on urban development.
- Each group creates a poster outlining their forum plan, including objectives, participants, agenda, facilitation strategies, and documentation methods.
- Groups present their plans to the class, and peers provide constructive feedback.

## 2. Urban Space Redesign Challenge (40 minutes)
- In pairs, students are assigned a specific urban space in their community (e.g., park, marketplace, community center).
- Using large sheets of paper and markers, pairs redesign the space to better accommodate intergenerational interactions and reflect traditional Timorese values.
- Pairs present their designs to the class, explaining their choices and how they incorporated intergenerational perspectives.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Elder Interview Preparation (20 minutes)
- Students individually develop a set of interview questions to ask an elder about their vision for urban development in Timor-Leste.
- They consider how to respectfully approach elders and what cultural protocols to follow during the interview.
- Students share their questions with a partner for feedback before finalizing their list.

## 2. Visual Storytelling Storyboard (30 minutes)
- Each student creates a storyboard for a visual storytelling project that will document elders' visions for urban spaces.
- The storyboard should include key scenes, interview questions, and visual elements they plan to incorporate.
- Students can use a mix of drawings and written descriptions to outline their project.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Reflection Web (15 minutes)
- Create a large web on the whiteboard with "Intergenerational Urban Planning" in the center.
- Students take turns adding key concepts, insights, or questions they have about the topic to the web, creating connections between ideas.
- Discuss the completed web as a class, identifying areas for further exploration or clarification.

## 2. One Word Takeaway (10 minutes)
- Students write one word on a sticky note that encapsulates their main takeaway from the lesson.
- They stick their note on the wall and briefly explain their choice to a partner.
- As a class, group similar words together and discuss emerging themes or patterns in the students' takeaways.
