# Warm-up Activities

## Plant Identification Race
- Divide the class into small teams
- Display various Timorese crops and medicinal plants around the room
- Teams race to identify and write down the names and uses of as many plants as possible in 5 minutes
- Discuss findings as a class, highlighting the depth of local plant knowledge

## Urban Agriculture Word Web
- Write "Urban Agriculture" in the center of a large paper or board
- Students take turns adding related words, concepts, or ideas, connecting them to create a web
- Discuss the connections and introduce key vocabulary

# Main Lesson Activities

## Traditional Knowledge Jigsaw
- Divide students into "expert groups" to research different aspects of traditional Timorese agriculture:
  1. Shifting cultivation
  2. Intercropping techniques
  3. Sacred groves and forest management
  4. Seasonal planting calendars
- Expert groups then split to form new groups with one member from each original group
- Students teach their peers about their expert topic

## Urban Agriculture Benefits and Challenges Debate
- Divide the class into two groups: "Benefits" and "Challenges"
- Each group brainstorms and prepares arguments for their assigned perspective
- Conduct a structured debate, allowing rebuttals and questions
- Conclude with a class discussion on balancing benefits and addressing challenges

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Traditional Garden Layout Analysis
- In small groups, provide students with diagrams of traditional Timorese garden layouts
- Groups analyze the layouts, identifying crop combinations and their purposes
- Discuss how these principles could be applied in an urban setting
- Groups present their findings to the class

## Seasonal Urban Planting Calendar Creation
- In pairs, students create a seasonal planting calendar for urban gardens in Dili
- Provide resources on local climate patterns and traditional ecological knowledge
- Pairs share their calendars, discussing similarities and differences in their approaches

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Urban Agriculture Site Suitability Assessment
- Provide students with maps of different neighborhoods in Dili
- Students individually assess the suitability of each area for urban agriculture projects
- Consider factors such as available space, sunlight, water access, and community needs
- Students write a brief report justifying their assessments

## Traditional Plant Use Research
- Assign each student a specific Timorese plant to research
- Students investigate the plant's traditional uses, cultivation methods, and potential for urban agriculture
- Create an informational poster or digital presentation about their assigned plant

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Urban Agriculture Vision Board
- Provide magazines, newspapers, and art supplies
- Students create vision boards depicting their ideal urban agriculture project in Timor-Leste
- Incorporate elements of traditional knowledge and modern sustainable practices
- Gallery walk to view and discuss each other's vision boards

## Reflection Circle
- Form a circle with the entire class
- Pass around a traditional Timorese object (e.g., tais cloth or woven basket)
- When holding the object, each student shares one key learning from the lesson and how they might apply it in their community
- Conclude with a group discussion on the potential impact of urban agriculture in Timor-Leste
