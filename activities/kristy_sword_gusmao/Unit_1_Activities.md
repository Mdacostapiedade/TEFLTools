# Warm-up Activities

## Language Biography Map
- Students create a visual map of their language learning journey
- Include languages spoken at home, school, and other contexts
- Use different colors or symbols for each language
- Share maps in pairs, discussing similarities and differences

## Language Policy Brainstorm
- In small groups, students brainstorm what they know about language policies
- Write ideas on sticky notes and place them on a shared poster
- Discuss as a class, organizing ideas into categories (e.g., education, government, media)

# Main Lesson Activities

## Historical Timeline Creation
- Divide class into groups, each assigned a different historical period
- Groups research and create a visual representation of language use during their period
- Present findings to the class, building a comprehensive timeline on the board

## Policy Document Jigsaw
- Divide students into "expert" groups, each analyzing a different section of current language policy documents
- Regroup students to share their expertise with others
- Create a summary chart of key policy points

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Language Policy Debate
- Divide class into groups representing different stakeholders (e.g., government, educators, indigenous communities)
- Each group develops arguments for their preferred language policy
- Conduct a structured debate, with groups presenting and responding to each other's points

## School Implementation Plan
- In pairs, students design a plan to implement current language policies in a hypothetical school
- Consider challenges such as resources, teacher training, and community engagement
- Present plans to another pair for feedback and discussion

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Policy Impact Analysis
- Students individually analyze the potential impacts of current language policies on different aspects of society (e.g., education, economy, cultural preservation)
- Write a short essay summarizing their analysis and providing recommendations

## Language Use Survey Design
- Each student designs a survey to gather data on language use in their community
- Include questions about languages used at home, work, and in public spaces
- Share surveys with a partner for feedback and refinement

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Reflection Carousel
- Set up stations around the room with different reflection prompts about the lesson
- Students move between stations, spending 2-3 minutes writing responses at each
- Prompts could include:
  * "One thing I learned today..."
  * "A question I still have is..."
  * "This lesson made me think differently about..."

## Language Policy Tweet
- Students summarize their main takeaway from the lesson in a 280-character "tweet"
- Share tweets with the class, either by reading aloud or posting on a digital platform
- Discuss common themes and insights that emerge from the tweets
