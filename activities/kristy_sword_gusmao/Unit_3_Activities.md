# Warm-up Activities

## 1. School Facility Bingo

- Create bingo cards with various school facility features (e.g., clean toilets, library, computer lab, playground)
- Students mingle and ask classmates about their school experiences
- Mark off features they find in others' past or present schools
- First to complete a line or full card wins

## 2. Facility Impact Brainstorm

- Display an image of a poorly-equipped classroom
- In small groups, students list potential impacts on student participation
- Groups share ideas, creating a class mind map on the board

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Jigsaw Reading: Facility Impact Research

- Divide class into expert groups, each assigned a different aspect of school facilities (e.g., sanitation, classroom environment, technology)
- Groups read and summarize research on their assigned topic
- Regroup into mixed teams to share findings and complete a comprehensive summary sheet

## 2. Data Analysis Challenge

- Provide groups with datasets on school facilities and student participation rates in Timor-Leste
- Groups analyze data to identify correlations and trends
- Create visual representations (graphs, charts) to present findings to the class

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. School Facility Improvement Proposal

- In pairs, students design an ideal school layout addressing key facility needs
- Create a poster or digital presentation of their design
- Include justifications for each feature based on potential impact on student participation

## 2. Debate: Prioritizing Facility Improvements

- Divide class into groups, each assigned a specific facility improvement (e.g., better classrooms, improved sanitation, computer lab)
- Groups prepare arguments for why their assigned improvement should be prioritized
- Conduct a structured debate, with teams presenting arguments and rebuttals

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Facility Assessment Checklist Creation

- Students develop a comprehensive checklist for assessing school facilities
- Include categories such as safety, learning environment, sanitation, and resources
- Justify the inclusion of each item on the checklist

## 2. Reflective Journal: Personal School Facility Experience

- Students write a reflective journal entry about their own school's facilities
- Describe how these facilities have impacted their learning and participation
- Propose improvements and explain their potential benefits

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Gallery Walk: Field Visit Findings

- Display group findings from the field visit around the classroom
- Students circulate, leaving post-it note comments or questions on each display
- Conclude with a class discussion on common themes and unique observations

## 2. One-Minute Paper: Key Takeaways

- Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned about school facilities and student participation
- Volunteer to share responses, creating a collective summary of key points
- Teacher addresses any misconceptions or gaps in understanding
