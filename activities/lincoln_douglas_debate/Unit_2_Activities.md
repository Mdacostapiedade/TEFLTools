# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Controversial Statement Carousel
- Set up stations around the room with controversial statements related to Timorese issues
- Students move from station to station, writing their initial claim and one reason for each statement
- Discuss as a class, highlighting natural use of claims and warrants

## 2. Rapid-Fire Argument Chain
- Students stand in a circle
- First student makes a claim about a Timorese issue
- Next student provides a warrant for that claim
- Third student gives an impact
- Continue around the circle with new claims

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Argument Component Jigsaw
- Divide class into three groups: Claims, Warrants, and Impacts
- Each group receives cards with their respective components on Timorese topics
- Students mingle to form complete arguments, explaining their reasoning

## 2. Evidence Type Scavenger Hunt
- Hide various pieces of evidence (statistics, quotes, anecdotes) around the classroom
- Students search for evidence and categorize it as empirical, anecdotal, or expert testimony
- Discuss findings and how each type could be used in an argument

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Argument Building Blocks
- In small groups, provide a set of argument components on cards (claims, warrants, impacts, evidence)
- Groups construct the strongest possible argument on a given Timorese issue
- Present to class, explaining their choices

## 2. Debate Topic Brainstorm and Argument Map
- Groups choose a current Timorese issue
- Create a mind map of potential arguments for both sides
- Identify the strongest claim-warrant-impact combination for each side

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Argument Analysis Worksheet
- Provide students with a short text on a Timorese issue
- Students identify and label claims, warrants, and impacts
- Write one additional argument using the claim-warrant-impact model

## 2. Evidence Evaluation Challenge
- Present students with various pieces of evidence on a Timorese topic
- Students rate each piece of evidence on credibility and persuasiveness
- Justify their ratings and explain how they would use the evidence in an argument

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Three-Two-One Reflection
- Students write down:
  * Three new things they learned about constructing arguments
  * Two ways they can improve their argument-building skills
  * One question they still have about the topic

## 2. Argument Speed Dating
- Students pair up and face each other in two lines
- Given a Timorese debate topic, one student makes a claim
- The other provides a warrant and impact
- Rotate partners and repeat with new topics

## 3. Exit Ticket: Mini-Argument Construction
- As students leave, they must construct a mini-argument on a given Timorese issue
- Must include a claim, warrant, and impact in three sentences or less
