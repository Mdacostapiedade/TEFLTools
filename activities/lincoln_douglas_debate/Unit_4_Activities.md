# Warm-up Activities

## Debate Topic Carousel
- Students move around the room to different stations, each with a current Timorese social issue written on a large sheet of paper.
- At each station, students write one argument for or against the issue.
- After 2 minutes, students rotate to the next station.
- Conclude by reviewing the most interesting arguments as a class.

## Value Premise Matching Game
- Create cards with value premises on one set and real-world scenarios on another.
- Students work in pairs to match value premises with relevant scenarios.
- Discuss matches as a class, exploring how values apply to different situations.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Case Structure Jigsaw
- Divide students into expert groups, each focusing on one component of case construction (e.g., value premise, criterion, contentions).
- Expert groups study their component and prepare to teach others.
- Regroup students into mixed teams where each student teaches their component.
- Teams collaboratively create a complete case structure diagram.

## Case Analysis Station Rotation
- Set up stations around the room, each with a sample case (affirmative or negative).
- Students rotate through stations in small groups, analyzing different aspects of each case (e.g., strength of value premise, logical flow of contentions).
- Groups present their findings on one case to the class.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Contention Construction Challenge
- In pairs, students receive a value premise and criterion related to a Timorese issue.
- Pairs brainstorm and develop two strong contentions that support the value premise and meet the criterion.
- Pairs exchange contentions with another team for peer feedback.

## Case Outline Collaboration
- In groups of three, students choose a Timorese social issue.
- Each student takes responsibility for different parts of the case (e.g., value/criterion, first contention, second contention).
- Groups combine their work to create a complete case outline.
- Present outlines to another group for constructive criticism.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Rapid Resolutional Analysis
- Provide students with a list of 5-7 debate resolutions relevant to Timor-Leste.
- Students have 2 minutes per resolution to write a brief resolutional analysis.
- Focus on identifying key terms, potential value premises, and main areas of clash.

## Value Premise and Criterion Development
- Students choose a personal value important in Timorese culture.
- They write a paragraph explaining why this value is significant and propose a criterion to measure its achievement.
- Students then apply this value and criterion to a current social issue in Timor-Leste.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Case Component Bingo
- Create bingo cards with case components in the squares (e.g., "Value Premise," "First Contention," "Resolutional Analysis").
- Read out descriptions or examples of components.
- Students mark off the corresponding component on their card.
- First to get a line calls "Bingo" and explains the components in their winning line.

## One-Minute Case Summary
- Students pair up and choose an affirmative or negative position on a simple resolution.
- Each student has one minute to present a summary of their case to their partner.
- Partners provide feedback on the clarity and organization of the summary.
- Conclude by having a few volunteers present their summaries to the class.
