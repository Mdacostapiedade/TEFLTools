# Warm-up Activities

## Argument Ping-Pong
1. Divide students into pairs
2. Provide a simple claim (e.g., "Social media is beneficial for society")
3. Students take turns making arguments for and against the claim, alternating every 30 seconds
4. After 3 minutes, discuss how quickly they had to think and adapt their arguments

## Refutation Race
1. Write several common arguments on the board
2. Divide the class into teams
3. Teams race to come up with a refutation for each argument
4. The first team to refute all arguments wins

# Main Lesson Activities

## Refutation Type Sorting
1. Prepare cards with various refutation examples
2. Students work in small groups to sort the cards into categories: turn, take-out, and mitigate
3. Discuss the sorting results as a class, clarifying any misunderstandings

## Rebuttal Building Blocks
1. Provide students with a sample argument
2. Guide them through constructing a rebuttal using the following steps:
   - Identify the key points to address
   - Brainstorm potential refutations for each point
   - Organize the refutations into a coherent structure
   - Add transitional phrases and a conclusion

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Refutation Rotation
1. Divide students into groups of 4-5
2. Provide each group with a different argument on a Timorese issue
3. Groups brainstorm refutations for their argument
4. After 5 minutes, groups rotate arguments and add to the previous group's refutations
5. Continue until all groups have worked on all arguments

## Tag-Team Rebuttal
1. Pair students and assign a resolution
2. One student from each pair gives a 2-minute constructive speech
3. The other pair then works together to construct and deliver a 3-minute rebuttal
4. Switch roles and repeat with a new resolution

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Refutation Journal
1. Provide students with a list of 5-7 common arguments on Timorese issues
2. Students write a brief refutation for each argument in their debate journals
3. Encourage them to use a variety of refutation types

## Rebuttal Speech Outline
1. Give students a sample affirmative case on a Timorese topic
2. Students individually outline a 3-minute negative rebuttal speech
3. Emphasize addressing key arguments, using evidence, and maintaining organization

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Refutation Bingo
1. Create bingo cards with different refutation techniques and principles
2. Read out examples of refutations or rebuttals
3. Students mark their cards when they identify the technique or principle used
4. First student to get "bingo" wins

## One-Minute Paper
1. Ask students to write for one minute on:
   - One new refutation strategy they learned
   - One aspect of rebuttal they want to improve
2. Collect the papers to assess understanding and plan future lessons

## Rebuttal Relay
1. Divide the class into two teams
2. Provide a series of short arguments
3. Teams take turns sending a member to the front to give a quick 30-second rebuttal
4. Award points for effective rebuttals and use of different refutation types
