# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Speed Flowing Race

- Divide students into pairs
- Each pair gets a short, pre-written speech (30 seconds long)
- One student reads the speech while the other flows
- Switch roles and repeat
- Compare flows and discuss strategies for quick, efficient note-taking

## 2. Time Management Charades

- Write different debate speech types on cards (e.g., "1AC", "1NC", "1AR")
- Students draw a card and must silently act out how they would allocate time for that speech
- Other students guess the speech type and discuss the time management strategy

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Flow Sheet Design Workshop

- Students create their own flow sheet template
- Discuss and compare different layouts and organizational strategies
- Vote on the most effective designs and explain why they work well

## 2. Time Allocation Puzzle

- Provide students with a list of arguments and a specific speech time
- Students must create a plan for addressing all arguments within the time limit
- Present plans to the class and discuss the reasoning behind choices

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Flowing Relay

- Form groups of 4-5 students
- Play a recorded debate speech (2-3 minutes)
- Each student flows for 30 seconds before passing to the next person
- Compare final flows and discuss challenges of picking up where others left off

## 2. Time Management Strategy Development

- In small groups, create a "cheat sheet" of time management tips for different speech types
- Share with the class and compile a master list of strategies

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Silent Video Flowing

- Play a debate video without sound
- Students practice flowing based only on visual cues (speaker changes, gestures, etc.)
- Compare with the actual arguments when audio is revealed

## 2. Time Pressure Argument Construction

- Provide a resolution and a short list of arguments
- Students have 2 minutes to construct a coherent speech addressing as many arguments as possible
- Self-evaluate time usage and argument coverage

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Flowing Pictionary

- Students draw representations of debate concepts (e.g., "dropped argument", "time allocation")
- Others guess the concept and explain its importance in flowing and time management

## 2. One-Minute Reflection

- Students write for one minute on:
  1. One new flowing technique they learned
  2. One time management strategy they want to implement
  3. One challenge they still face in flowing or time management
- Share reflections in pairs or small groups
