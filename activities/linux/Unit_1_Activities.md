# Engaging Activities for Introduction to Linux and the Command Line

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Linux Logo Guessing Game
- Display various Linux distribution logos on the projector
- Students work in pairs to guess the names of the distributions
- Discuss the most popular distributions and their characteristics

### 2. "I Spy" Command Line Edition
- Instructor opens a terminal and navigates through directories
- Students call out commands they recognize or can guess based on the output

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Command Line Scavenger Hunt
- Provide students with a list of items to find using command line tools
- Examples: largest file in the home directory, number of users on the system, current kernel version
- Students race to find all items using only CLI commands

### 2. Build-a-Command Workshop
- Display a desired outcome (e.g., "list all .txt files in the current directory")
- Students collaborate to construct the correct command to achieve the result

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Directory Structure Architects
- In groups of 3-4, students design a directory structure for a mock company
- Groups then exchange designs and implement them using only CLI commands

### 2. Command Line Pictionary
- One student from each pair receives a command to draw
- Their partner must guess the command based on the drawing
- Switch roles and repeat with new commands

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Command Line Maze
- Provide students with a text file containing a "maze" of directories
- Students must navigate the maze using cd and ls commands to find a hidden file

### 2. Rapid Fire Commands
- Display a series of tasks on the projector (e.g., "create a directory named 'projects'")
- Students race to complete each task using the correct command

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. Command Line Jeopardy
- Create a Jeopardy-style game with categories like "File Operations," "Navigation," and "System Info"
- Students compete in teams to answer questions by providing the correct command

### 2. Linux Fortune Cookies
- Use the 'fortune' command to generate random quotes or sayings
- Students take turns reading their "fortune" and explaining how it might relate to what they learned about Linux

### 3. One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have about Linux or the command line
