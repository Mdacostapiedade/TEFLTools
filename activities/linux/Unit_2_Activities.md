# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Command Line Bingo

- Create bingo cards with common file system commands and concepts
- Call out definitions or use cases, and students mark off the corresponding command
- First to get a line wins

## 2. File System Hierarchy Puzzle

- Provide students with cards representing different directories
- Have them work in pairs to arrange the cards in the correct hierarchical structure
- Discuss the results as a class

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Directory Treasure Hunt

- Hide "treasure" (text files with clues) in various directories on a test system
- Students use command-line navigation to find all the treasures
- First team to collect all clues wins

## 2. Permission Scenarios

- Present real-world scenarios (e.g., shared project folder, confidential documents)
- Students determine and implement appropriate permissions using chmod and chown
- Discuss the reasoning behind their choices

## 3. File System Operation Charades

- Students act out file system operations without speaking
- Others guess the command being demonstrated (e.g., cp, mv, rm)
- Reinforces understanding of command functions in a fun, interactive way

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Mock File Server Setup

- In groups of 3-4, students design and implement a file server structure
- Include shared directories, user home directories, and system directories
- Set appropriate permissions and ownership for each directory
- Present and justify their design to the class

## 2. File System Scavenger Hunt

- Provide a list of files with specific attributes (e.g., owned by a particular user, executable, larger than 1MB)
- Groups compete to find all the files using appropriate commands (find, ls, du)
- First group to locate all files wins

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Command Line Obstacle Course

- Create a series of challenges that require using multiple commands in sequence
- Examples: "Create a directory, move into it, create a file, copy it to another directory, then delete the original"
- Students complete the course, logging their commands for review

## 2. Permission Calculation Drills

- Provide a series of permission scenarios in both symbolic and numeric notation
- Students practice converting between notations and determining resulting permissions
- Include edge cases and complex scenarios to challenge understanding

## 3. Relative vs. Absolute Path Navigation

- Set up a complex directory structure
- Give students a starting point and an end destination
- They must provide both the relative and absolute paths to navigate between the two
- Repeat with different start and end points

# Cool-down Activities

## 1. File System Jeopardy

- Create a Jeopardy-style game with categories like "Permissions," "Directory Structure," "Command Syntax"
- Play in teams to review key concepts from the lesson

## 2. One-Minute File System

- Students have one minute to draw the main Linux file system hierarchy from memory
- Compare drawings and discuss any discrepancies or misconceptions

## 3. Command Line Telephone

- Students sit in a circle
- First student writes a simple command line operation
- Pass it to the next student, who must draw the result
- Next student interprets the drawing and writes the command, and so on
- Compare the final command to the original to see how it changed
