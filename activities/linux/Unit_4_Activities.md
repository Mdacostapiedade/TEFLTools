# Engaging Activities for User and Group Management Lesson

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. User Account Brainstorm (5 minutes)
- In small groups, students brainstorm different types of user accounts they might encounter in various settings (e.g., home, school, office).
- Groups share their ideas with the class, creating a comprehensive list on the whiteboard.

### 2. Permission Puzzle (5 minutes)
- Display a series of file permission combinations (e.g., rwxr-xr-x, rw-r--r--) on the board.
- Students guess what each combination means and discuss potential real-world scenarios where these permissions might be used.

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. User Management Command Bingo (15 minutes)
- Create bingo cards with various user management commands and their options.
- As you demonstrate each command, students mark off the corresponding items on their cards.
- First student to complete a row or column wins a small prize.

### 2. Sudo Scenario Role-play (10 minutes)
- Divide the class into pairs. One student plays a system administrator, the other a regular user.
- Provide scenarios where the regular user needs to perform tasks requiring elevated privileges.
- Students role-play the interaction, discussing when and how to use sudo appropriately.

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. User Account Setup Challenge (20 minutes)
- In pairs, students receive a fictional company scenario with various departments and roles.
- They must create a plan for user accounts and groups, including naming conventions and sudo access.
- Pairs implement their plan on their Linux systems and present their solution to another pair for feedback.

### 2. Troubleshooting User Issues (15 minutes)
- Provide groups with a list of common user account issues (e.g., forgotten password, incorrect permissions, sudo access problems).
- Groups discuss and document the steps to resolve each issue.
- Each group presents one solution to the class, explaining their reasoning.

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. User Management Command Drill (10 minutes)
- Provide a worksheet with various user management tasks.
- Students write the exact commands needed to accomplish each task.
- Tasks include creating users with specific home directories, adding users to groups, and modifying user properties.

### 2. Sudoers File Configuration (15 minutes)
- Give students a sudoers file with syntax errors and missing entries.
- Students must correct the errors and add appropriate entries for given scenarios.
- Emphasize the importance of using `visudo` for editing the sudoers file.

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. User Management Concept Map (10 minutes)
- Students create a concept map linking key terms and commands related to user and group management.
- Encourage students to include examples and use cases in their concept maps.

### 2. One-Minute Paper (5 minutes)
- Students write a brief response to two questions:
  1. What was the most important thing you learned about user and group management today?
  2. What question do you still have about the topic?
- Collect the papers to assess understanding and address common questions in the next lesson.

### 3. Command Line Charades (5 minutes)
- Students take turns acting out user management commands without speaking.
- The rest of the class guesses the command being portrayed.
- This fun activity reinforces command recognition and serves as a light-hearted conclusion to the lesson.
