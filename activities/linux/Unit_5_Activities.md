# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Log File Scavenger Hunt (10 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a list of specific events to find in various log files
- First group to find all events wins
- Discuss findings as a class

## 2. System Monitoring Pictionary (10 minutes)

- Guide students through using grep, awk, and sed to extract specific information
- Gradually increase the complexity of the queries

## 2. Live System Monitoring Demo (15 minutes)
- Set up a system with high load
- Demonstrate the use of various monitoring tools (top, htop, iotop)
- Explain how to interpret the output and identify potential issues

## 3. Custom Logging Configuration (15 minutes)

- Students compete individually or in small teams
- Review answers as a class

## 2. Real-world Scenario Discussion (10 minutes)
- Present a real-world system issue scenario
- In small groups, students discuss how they would approach troubleshooting using the tools and techniques learned
- Share approaches with the class and discuss the pros and cons of each

## 3. Reflection and Key Takeaways (5 minutes)
