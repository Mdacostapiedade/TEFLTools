# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Command Line Bingo

- Create bingo cards with common Linux commands
- Call out command descriptions; students mark off the corresponding command
- First to get a line wins

## 2. Automation Brainstorm

- In small groups, students list daily computer tasks they find repetitive
- Share ideas with the class and discuss which could be automated with scripts

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Script Structure Puzzle

- Provide students with scrambled parts of a simple shell script
- Students rearrange the parts to create a working script
- Discuss the purpose of each component

## 2. Variable Scavenger Hunt

- Hide variables with different data types around the classroom
- Students find and categorize them (string, integer, array)
- Discuss how to use each type in a script

## 3. Conditional Flowchart

- Present a real-world scenario (e.g., deciding what to wear based on weather)
- Students create a flowchart using if-else statements
- Translate the flowchart into a shell script

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Loop Challenge

- In pairs, students write a script that:
  * Asks the user for a number
  * Prints a countdown from that number to 1
  * Uses a different type of loop than their neighboring pair

## 2. Command Substitution Relay

- Form teams of 3-4 students
- Each team member writes a command that outputs a piece of system information
- Teams combine their commands using command substitution to create a system info script

## 3. Piping Puzzle

- Provide groups with a set of commands and desired output
- Groups must arrange the commands using pipes to achieve the output
- First group to solve the puzzle explains their solution to the class

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Personalized Greeter

- Write a script that:
  * Asks for the user's name and favorite color
  * Greets the user with a colorized message using their name
  * Provides a different message based on the time of day

## 2. File Organizer

- Create a script that:
  * Scans a directory for files with specific extensions
  * Moves files into subdirectories based on their type (e.g., .txt, .jpg, .pdf)
  * Prints a summary of how many files were moved

## 3. System Resource Monitor

- Develop a script that:
  * Checks CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space
  * Uses conditionals to provide warnings if usage exceeds certain thresholds
  * Logs the results to a file with a timestamp

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Script Show and Tell

- Students volunteer to present their favorite script from the lesson
- Class discusses potential improvements or alternative approaches

## 2. Concept Map Creation

- Individually or in small groups, create a concept map linking the key terms and concepts from the lesson
- Share and compare maps to reinforce connections between ideas

## 3. Exit Ticket Quiz

- Short quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Students submit their answers and one question they still have about shell scripting
