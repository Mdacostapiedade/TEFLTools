# Warm-up Activities

## Lymphatic System Charades
- Students act out functions of the lymphatic system (e.g., filtering toxins, fighting infections) while others guess
- Encourages physical movement and reinforces understanding of lymphatic system functions

## Pressure Perception Game
- Students pair up and take turns applying different pressures to each other's arms
- Partners guess if the pressure is appropriate for MLD, too light, or too heavy
- Develops sensitivity to correct MLD pressure

# Main Lesson Activities

## MLD Technique Rotation Stations
- Set up stations for each basic MLD stroke (stationary circles, pump, rotary, scoop)
- Students rotate through stations, practicing each technique for 5 minutes
- Instructor provides feedback at each station

## Lymph Flow Visualization Exercise
- Using blue yarn, students create a "map" of lymph flow on a volunteer's body
- Discuss how MLD techniques follow these pathways

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## MLD Sequence Creation
- In small groups, students create a short MLD sequence for a specific body part
- Groups demonstrate their sequences to the class and explain their choices

## Cultural Adaptation Discussion
- Pairs discuss how to adapt MLD techniques to respect Timorese cultural norms
- Create a list of dos and don'ts for performing MLD in Timor-Leste

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Self-MLD Journal
- Students practice self-MLD techniques daily for a week
- Keep a journal noting observations, challenges, and perceived benefits

## MLD Technique Video Analysis
- Provide students with videos of MLD techniques
- Students write a brief analysis of the techniques, noting correct form and areas for improvement

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## MLD Bingo
- Create bingo cards with MLD terms, techniques, and concepts
- Play a quick game to review key points from the lesson

## Reflection Circle
- Students stand in a circle and take turns sharing one new thing they learned about MLD
- Encourage connections between MLD and traditional Timorese healing practices

## Quick Quiz Ball Toss
- Ask true/false questions about MLD principles
- Toss a soft ball to students for answers, promoting active engagement and quick recall
