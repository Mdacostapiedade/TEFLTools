# Warm-up Activities

## Cultural Touch Map
- Students create a "touch map" of the upper body, color-coding areas based on cultural sensitivity in Timorese society
- Discuss findings as a class, noting differences between medical and social contexts

## Lymph Flow Visualization
- Students use blue ribbons to trace lymph pathways on a partner's upper body
- Practice describing the flow in Tetum, using newly learned vocabulary

# Main Lesson Activities

## Anatomy Jigsaw
- Divide class into groups, each responsible for learning about a specific part of the upper body lymphatic system
- Groups then teach their section to others, creating a complete picture

## MLD Technique Stations
- Set up stations for different MLD techniques (neck, shoulder, arm, hand)
- Students rotate through stations, practicing each technique and receiving feedback

## Cultural Adaptation Scenarios
- Present various patient scenarios (e.g., elderly woman, young man, pregnant mother)
- Students discuss and demonstrate how to adapt MLD techniques for each scenario

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## MLD Sequence Puzzle
- Provide groups with cards describing individual MLD movements
- Groups arrange cards in correct sequence for upper body MLD

## Tetum Translation Challenge
- Pairs translate a short English paragraph about MLD benefits into Tetum
- Groups compare translations, discussing nuances and best practices

## Peer Teaching Practice
- One student performs MLD technique while partner provides verbal guidance in Tetum
- Switch roles and repeat for different body areas

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Self-MLD Journal
- Students practice self-MLD techniques at home for a week
- Record observations, challenges, and questions in a reflective journal

## Patient Education Script Writing
- Each student writes a script for explaining upper body MLD to a patient in Tetum
- Include addressing common concerns and cultural considerations

## Technique Video Analysis
- Students watch videos of MLD techniques, noting correct hand placements and movements
- Write a short report comparing video techniques to classroom learning

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## MLD Pictionary
- Students take turns drawing MLD techniques or lymphatic system components
- Others guess the term in Tetum and English

## Reflection Circle
- Form a circle and pass a small object
- Each student shares one new thing they learned and one question they still have

## Cultural Consideration Brainstorm
- As a class, create a list of cultural considerations for performing MLD in Timor-Leste
- Discuss how to address each consideration in practice
