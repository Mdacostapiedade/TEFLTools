# Warm-up Activities

## MLD Technique Rapid Fire
- Students form pairs
- Each pair has 2 minutes to quiz each other on basic MLD techniques
- After 2 minutes, pairs switch partners and repeat

## Swelling Stories
- Students share brief anecdotes about patients they've encountered with swelling or lymphatic issues
- Class discusses common themes and challenges observed

# Main Lesson Activities

## Condition Carousel
- Set up three stations around the room, each focusing on one condition (post-surgical swelling, chronic venous insufficiency, lymphatic filariasis)
- Students rotate through stations, spending 10 minutes at each
- At each station, students read a brief case study and practice relevant MLD techniques on a partner

## Treatment Plan Challenge
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group receives a complex patient scenario involving multiple conditions
- Groups have 15 minutes to develop a comprehensive MLD treatment plan
- Groups present their plans to the class for feedback

# Group Work Tasks

## Technique Teach-Back
- Divide class into three groups, each assigned a specific condition
- Groups research and practice MLD techniques for their condition
- Each group teaches their techniques to the rest of the class

## Cultural Adaptation Workshop
- In small groups, students discuss potential cultural barriers to MLD in Timor-Leste
- Groups brainstorm ways to adapt MLD techniques to be more culturally appropriate
- Create a list of do's and don'ts for practicing MLD in Timorese communities

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Self-Drainage Sequence Design
- Each student designs a simple self-drainage sequence for patients with mild lymphedema
- Students create an illustrated guide in Tetum to accompany their sequence

## Contraindications Checklist
- Students develop a comprehensive checklist of contraindications for MLD
- Checklist should be easy to use in a clinical setting

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## Condition Charades
- Write various lymphatic conditions on slips of paper
- Students take turns acting out the conditions while others guess
- Emphasize the visible symptoms and appropriate MLD responses

## Reflection Circle
- Students form a circle and pass around a small object
- When holding the object, each student shares:
  1. One new thing they learned
  2. One technique they want to practice more
  3. One way they plan to apply MLD in their practice

## Quick Quiz
- Students complete a brief multiple-choice quiz on key concepts
- Review answers as a class, clarifying any misunderstandings
