# Warm-up Activities

## Cultural Memory Lane
- Students create a timeline of their family's traditional practices, noting which ones are still active and which have been lost.
- In pairs, they discuss the reasons behind the preservation or loss of these practices.

## Threat Brainstorm
- In small groups, students have 2 minutes to list as many threats to indigenous knowledge as they can think of.
- Groups share their lists, and the class compiles a master list on the board.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Preservation Strategies Jigsaw
1. Divide the class into "expert groups" focusing on different preservation strategies:
   - Documentation
   - Education
   - Community engagement
   - Policy and legislation
2. Each group researches their strategy and its application in both Q'ero and Timorese contexts.
3. Students then form new groups with one expert from each strategy to share their findings.

## Adaptation Scenario Role-Play
- Assign students roles (e.g., elder, youth, government official, tourist) in a scenario where a traditional practice needs to be adapted for modern life.
- Groups act out their scenario, demonstrating the challenges and potential solutions.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Mind Map Challenge
- In pairs, students create a mind map connecting Andean concepts to Timorese cultural elements.
- They present their maps to another pair, explaining their connections.

## Preservation Pitch
- Small groups develop a "pitch" for a preservation project, including:
  - The practice to be preserved
  - The preservation strategy
  - Potential challenges and solutions
  - Expected outcomes
- Groups present their pitches to the class, who act as a funding committee.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Reflection Journal
- Students write a personal reflection on how globalization has affected their own cultural practices.
- They propose three actions they could take to preserve an aspect of their culture.

## Concept Adaptation Worksheet
- Provide a worksheet with Andean concepts on one side and blank spaces on the other.
- Students research and fill in corresponding Timorese concepts or practices that share similar principles.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Cultural Preservation Gallery Walk
- Students create quick posters summarizing their preservation proposals.
- The class does a gallery walk, leaving feedback and questions on sticky notes.

## Wisdom Web
- Standing in a circle, students toss a ball of yarn to each other.
- Each student who catches the yarn shares one key learning from the lesson before passing it on.
- The resulting web represents the interconnectedness of cultural wisdom.

## One-Minute Paper
- Students have one minute to write down:
  - The most important thing they learned
  - One question they still have
- Collect the papers to inform future lessons and address lingering questions.
