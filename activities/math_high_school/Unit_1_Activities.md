# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Math Memory Lane

- Students write down three vivid memories of learning math in school
- Share one memory with a partner, discussing emotions and challenges faced
- Volunteer to share interesting stories with the whole class

## 2. Language Shuffle

- Students receive cards with math terms in Tetum, Portuguese, and English
- In small groups, they match the terms across languages
- Discuss which language feels most natural for discussing math concepts

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Education System Jigsaw

- Divide class into expert groups, each focusing on a different level of Timorese education
- Groups research their assigned level and create a visual representation
- Regroup into mixed teams to share and compile a complete education system overview

## 2. Textbook Detective

- Provide groups with different math textbooks used in Timorese schools
- Groups analyze books for cultural relevance, language use, and teaching approach
- Create a pros and cons list for each textbook

## 3. Language Impact Simulation

- Conduct a brief math lesson in a language unfamiliar to most students
- Discuss the experience and relate it to challenges in bilingual math education

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Cultural Math Connections

- In pairs, students identify traditional Timorese practices that involve mathematical concepts
- Create a poster linking these practices to specific math topics in the curriculum

## 2. Curriculum Comparison

- Groups compare Timorese math curriculum with those from neighboring countries
- Present findings on similarities, differences, and potential areas for improvement

## 3. Math Vocabulary Charades

- Teams act out math terms while others guess, using only Tetum or Portuguese
- Discuss strategies for explaining math concepts without relying on specific vocabulary

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Personal Math Journey Map

- Students create a timeline of their math education experiences
- Highlight key moments, challenges, and breakthroughs

## 2. Linguistic Challenge Solver

- Provide a set of word problems in both Tetum and Portuguese
- Students solve problems and reflect on language-related difficulties

## 3. Cultural Math Resource Design

- Design a single-page math resource incorporating Timorese cultural elements
- Focus on making abstract concepts more relatable to local students

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Reflection Rotation

- Students write one new insight from the lesson on a sticky note
- Notes are posted on the wall and students do a gallery walk
- Discuss common themes and surprising learnings

## 2. Action Plan Brainstorm

- Individually, students list three actions they could take to improve math education in their community
- Share ideas in small groups and vote on the most impactful suggestions

## 3. Question Queue

- Students write questions about Timorese math education on index cards
- Collect cards and use them to guide discussions in future lessons
