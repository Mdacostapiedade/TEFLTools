# Warm-up Activities

## Math Memory Lane
- Participants write down their most memorable math lesson on a sticky note.
- In pairs, they share their experiences and discuss what made the lesson memorable.
- Volunteers share interesting stories with the whole group.

## Vocabulary Matching Game
- Create cards with key terms (e.g., student-centered learning, collaborative learning) and their definitions.
- Participants match terms to definitions in small groups, racing against other teams.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Approach Carousel
- Set up stations around the room, each representing a different student-centered approach (inquiry-based, problem-based, discovery learning).
- Groups rotate through stations, experiencing a mini-lesson using each approach.
- Participants discuss pros and cons of each method after experiencing all stations.

## Collaborative Technique Demonstration
- Instructor demonstrates the Jigsaw method using a math concept (e.g., types of triangles).
- Participants experience the method firsthand, then discuss its effectiveness.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Strategy Adaptation Workshop
- In groups of 3-4, participants select a traditional Timorese game or cultural practice.
- They brainstorm ways to incorporate mathematical concepts into the game/practice.
- Groups create a brief lesson plan integrating their ideas.

## Micro-teaching Planning
- Pairs choose a math topic from the Timorese curriculum.
- They plan a 5-minute micro-teaching session using a student-centered approach.
- Pairs practice their micro-teaching with each other before presenting to the larger group.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Differentiation Challenge
- Provide a sample math problem from the Timorese curriculum.
- Participants individually create three versions of the problem at different difficulty levels to demonstrate differentiation.

## Scaffolding Sequence
- Give participants a complex math concept (e.g., solving quadratic equations).
- They create a step-by-step scaffolding plan to teach this concept, considering Timorese students' needs.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Strategy Commitment
- Participants write down one new teaching strategy they commit to trying in their next math lesson.
- They share their commitment with a partner and discuss potential challenges and solutions.

## Reflection Web
- Create a web diagram on a large paper with "Diverse Teaching Approaches" in the center.
- Participants add sticky notes around the web with key takeaways, questions, or ideas from the lesson.
- Discuss common themes and insights as a group.
