## Industry Math Scavenger Hunt
1. Place images of various Timorese industries around the classroom.
2. Students move around, identifying mathematical concepts for each industry.
3. They write their ideas on sticky notes and place them near the images.
4. Class discussion to review and categorize the mathematical concepts identified.

## Real-World Math Charades
1. Divide the class into small groups.
2. Each group receives a card with a mathematical operation and a local industry.
3. Groups act out the mathematical concept in the context of the industry.
4. Other groups guess the concept and industry being portrayed.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Polya's Problem-Solving Relay
1. Create stations around the classroom, each with a local industry problem.
2. Divide students into teams.
3. Teams rotate through stations, applying one step of Polya's method at each.
4. Teams pass their work to the next station, building on previous teams' efforts.
5. Discuss solutions and problem-solving strategies as a class.

## Math in My Community Gallery Walk
1. Students create posters showcasing math applications in their communities.
2. Posters are displayed around the classroom.
3. Students conduct a gallery walk, leaving feedback and questions on sticky notes.
4. Presenters address questions and share insights with the class.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Industry Math Challenge
1. Assign each group a different Timorese industry.
2. Groups research and identify 5 ways math is used in their assigned industry.
3. Create a mind map or infographic to present findings.
4. Present to the class, explaining the mathematical concepts and their applications.

## Problem Creation Workshop
1. In pairs, students choose a local context or industry.
2. They create a multi-step math problem based on their chosen context.
3. Pairs exchange problems and solve using Polya's method.
4. Discuss the effectiveness of the problems and solutions as a class.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Math Journal
1. Students reflect on their daily activities and identify 3 instances where they use math.
2. For each instance, they write a brief explanation of the mathematical concept involved.
3. They create a simple problem based on one of these real-life situations.

## Industry Math Matching
1. Provide a worksheet with various Timorese industries listed on one side.
2. On the other side, list different mathematical concepts and operations.
3. Students draw lines to match industries with relevant mathematical concepts.
4. They justify their choices in writing below each match.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities
