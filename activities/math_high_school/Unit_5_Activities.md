# Warm-up Activities

## Dice Duel
- Students pair up and play "Even or Odd" with dice
- One student rolls, the other guesses if the result will be even or odd
- Play 5 rounds, then switch roles
- Discuss how probability and mental math are involved

## Cultural Math Charades
- Write mathematical terms on cards (e.g., addition, fraction, geometry)
- Students act out the terms using culturally relevant gestures or scenarios
- Class guesses the math concept being portrayed

# Main Lesson Activities

## Traditional Game Analysis
- Present 3-4 traditional Timorese games to the class
- Students identify mathematical elements in each game
- Discuss how these games could be adapted to teach specific math concepts

## Online Resource Scavenger Hunt
- Provide a list of online math game websites
- Students explore the sites and evaluate them based on given criteria
- Share findings with the class, highlighting culturally relevant aspects

## Math Game Design Workshop
- Demonstrate how to create a simple math game using local materials
- Guide students through the process of adapting a traditional game for math learning
- Emphasize incorporating cultural elements and targeting specific math skills

# Group Work Tasks

## Cultural Math Game Adaptation
- Divide class into groups of 4
- Each group chooses a traditional Timorese game to adapt for math instruction
- Groups modify rules and materials to focus on a specific math concept
- Present adapted games to the class

## Online Resource Evaluation Team
- Form small groups to evaluate different online math resources
- Assign each group a set of criteria (e.g., cultural relevance, ease of use)
- Groups create a presentation or poster to share their evaluations

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Game Design Challenge
- Students individually create a new math game incorporating local cultural elements
- Game must target a specific math skill and use readily available materials
- Write out game rules and instructions

## Resource Reflection Journal
- Students write a reflective entry about their favorite math game or resource explored in class
- Include how it could be used effectively in a Timorese classroom
- Suggest modifications to make it more culturally relevant if needed

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## Math Game Gallery Walk
- Display student-created games around the classroom
- Students circulate, try out games, and leave feedback notes
- Discuss as a class which games were most effective and why

## Cultural Math Connection Web
- Create a large web on the board connecting math concepts to Timorese cultural elements
- Students contribute ideas, drawing lines between related items
- Reflect on how this web demonstrates the integration of math and culture

## Exit Ticket: Game Plan
- Students write a brief plan for how they would use one game or resource from the lesson in their future teaching
- Include the math concept targeted and any cultural adaptations needed
