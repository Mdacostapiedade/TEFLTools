# Engaging Activities for Cultural and Language Considerations in Math Education

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Tais Pattern Scavenger Hunt
- Display various Timorese tais patterns around the classroom
- Students move around, identifying and noting mathematical concepts they observe
- Time limit: 5 minutes
- Class discussion on findings

### 2. Bilingual Math Charades
- Students act out mathematical terms without speaking
- Other students guess the term in both Tetum and Portuguese
- Terms include: triangle, square, circle, symmetry, pattern

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Ethnomathematics Exploration
- Present a brief video or slideshow on ethnomathematics
- Students discuss in pairs:
  - How mathematics is used in their daily lives
  - Examples of math in Timorese culture
- Share insights with the class

### 2. Bilingual Concept Mapping
- Create a large concept map on the board
- Students contribute mathematical terms in both languages
- Draw connections between related concepts
- Discuss the relationships and translations

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Tais Pattern Analysis
- Groups of 3-4 students
- Each group receives a different tais pattern
- Task:
  1. Identify geometric shapes and symmetries
  2. List mathematical concepts in Tetum and Portuguese
  3. Create a short presentation explaining the math in their pattern

### 2. Bilingual Math Story Creation
- Pairs of students
- Create a short math story problem incorporating Timorese cultural elements
- Write the problem in both Tetum and Portuguese
- Exchange with another pair to solve

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Vocabulary Crossword
- Crossword puzzle with mathematical terms
- Clues given in one language, answers in the other
- Includes terms from geometry, patterns, and basic operations

### 2. Cultural Math Application
- Students choose a Timorese craft or tradition
- Identify 3 mathematical concepts within it
- Write a paragraph explaining the connection, using key terms in both languages

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. Bilingual Math Pictionary
- Quick-draw game using math vocabulary
- One student draws, others guess in either language
- Rotate through 5-6 terms

### 2. Reflection Journaling
- Students write a short reflection (5 minutes)
- Prompt: "How can incorporating Timorese culture make math more relevant and engaging for you?"
- Optional: Share with a partner or the class

### 3. Exit Ticket
- Students complete a quick 3-2-1 exit ticket:
  - 3 new terms learned (in both languages)
  - 2 ways culture connects to math
  - 1 question they still have
