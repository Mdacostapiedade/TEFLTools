# Warm-up Activities

## Brain-Gut Connection Word Association
- Students write down the first word that comes to mind when they hear "brain," "gut," and "microbiota"
- Share responses and discuss patterns or interesting connections

## Traditional Wisdom Gallery Walk
- Post large sheets of paper around the room with different Timorese proverbs about food and health
- Students walk around, read the proverbs, and add their interpretations or modern scientific connections

# Main Lesson Activities

## Brain-Gut-Microbiota Axis Jigsaw
- Divide class into expert groups focusing on the brain, gut, or microbiota
- Each group researches their component and its role in the axis
- Regroup into mixed teams to share knowledge and create a comprehensive overview

## Communication Pathway Role-play
- Assign students roles as different components of the axis (e.g., neurons, gut cells, microbes)
- Students act out the communication process, passing messages along the axis

## Microbiota Diversity Demonstration
- Use different colored beads to represent various types of gut microbes
- Students create "gut samples" in clear containers, discussing how diet might affect the diversity

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Brain-Gut-Microbiota Axis Infographic
- In small groups, create an infographic explaining the brain-gut-microbiota axis
- Include key components, communication pathways, and the impact of diet

## Traditional vs. Modern Diet Debate
- Divide into two teams: one supporting traditional Timorese diet, the other modern processed foods
- Debate the impact of each on the brain-gut-microbiota axis, citing scientific evidence

## Microbiota Ecosystem Model
- In pairs, create a model ecosystem representing the gut microbiota
- Use craft materials to show different microbe types and their interactions

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Brain-Gut-Microbiota Axis Crossword Puzzle
- Create a crossword puzzle using key terms from the lesson
- Students complete the puzzle individually, reinforcing vocabulary

## Diet Impact Analysis
- Students analyze their own diet for a day, identifying foods that may positively or negatively impact the brain-gut-microbiota axis

## Concept Map Creation
- Individually create a concept map showing the relationships between different components of the brain-gut-microbiota axis

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned about the brain-gut-microbiota axis

## Brain-Gut-Microbiota Axis Quiz Show
- Divide class into teams for a quick, fun quiz game on the lesson content

## Reflection Circle
- Form a circle and pass around a "talking stick"
- Each student shares one way they plan to apply their new knowledge about the brain-gut-microbiota axis in their daily life
