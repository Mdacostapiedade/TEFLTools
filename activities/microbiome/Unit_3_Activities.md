# Warm-up Activities

## Brain Plasticity Ball Toss
- Students stand in a circle
- Toss a soft ball to a student and say a word related to brain development
- The student catches the ball, says a related word, and tosses it to another student
- Continue until everyone has participated

## Neuroplasticity Word Cloud
- Write "Neuroplasticity" in the center of the board
- Students come up and write words or phrases they associate with neuroplasticity
- Discuss the connections between the words as a class

# Main Lesson Activities

## Brain Development Timeline Creation
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a large sheet of paper and markers
- Groups create a visual timeline of brain development from conception to old age
- Include key milestones, critical periods, and potential interventions
- Groups present their timelines to the class

## Environmental Factors Gallery Walk
- Create stations around the room with different environmental factors affecting brain plasticity in Timor-Leste (e.g., nutrition, stress, education)
- Students rotate through stations, writing ideas on how each factor impacts brain development
- Discuss findings as a class

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Cultural Practices and Brain Development Poster
- Assign pairs or small groups a Timorese cultural practice
- Groups research and discuss how the practice may influence brain development and plasticity
- Create a poster summarizing their findings
- Present posters to the class

## Intervention Strategy Role-Play
- Divide students into pairs
- Each pair develops a role-play scenario where one student is a health worker and the other is a community member
- The health worker explains a brain development intervention strategy to the community member
- Pairs perform their role-plays for the class

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Brain Plasticity Reflection
- Students write a short reflection on how they've experienced neuroplasticity in their own lives
- Identify specific experiences or learning that may have changed their brain structure or function

## Brain Development Intervention Proposal
- Students individually design an intervention to support healthy brain development in Timor-Leste
- Write a brief proposal outlining the intervention, target age group, and expected outcomes

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Neuroplasticity Myth Busters
- Present common myths about brain development and plasticity
- Students vote on whether each statement is true or false
- Discuss the correct answers and clarify any misconceptions

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned about neuroplasticity and brain development
- Share responses with a partner or small group
- Collect papers to assess understanding and identify areas for review in the next lesson
