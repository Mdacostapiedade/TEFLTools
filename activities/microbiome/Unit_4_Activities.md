# Warm-up Activities

## Food Package Sorting
- Display various food packages from Timor-Leste (both ultra-processed and minimally processed)
- Students work in pairs to sort packages into "healthier" and "less healthy" categories
- Discuss choices as a class and introduce the concept of ultra-processed foods

## Ultra-processed Food Bingo
- Create bingo cards with names or images of common ultra-processed foods in Timor-Leste
- Call out characteristics of ultra-processed foods (e.g., high in added sugars, contains artificial colors)
- Students mark off items on their cards that match the descriptions
- First to get a line wins and explains why each item is ultra-processed

# Main Lesson Activities

## Ultra-processed Food Detective
- Provide students with a list of ingredients from various foods
- Students work in small groups to identify which ingredients are likely to be found in ultra-processed foods
- Groups present their findings and explain their reasoning

## Gut Microbiota Simulation
- Assign students roles as different types of gut bacteria
- Introduce various "foods" (represented by colored cards) into the "gut" (classroom)
- Students react based on whether the food promotes or hinders their growth
- Discuss how different foods affect the balance of gut microbiota

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Community Survey Design
- In small groups, students design a brief survey to assess ultra-processed food consumption in their local community
- Groups share their surveys and provide feedback to each other
- Class votes on the best questions to include in a final, comprehensive survey

## Educational Campaign Creation
- Divide the class into teams
- Each team creates an educational campaign (posters, slogans, social media posts) about the risks of ultra-processed foods
- Teams present their campaigns and explain their strategies for reaching Timorese audiences

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Food Label Analysis
- Provide students with food labels from ultra-processed foods common in Timor-Leste
- Students individually analyze the labels, identifying additives, added sugars, and other characteristics of ultra-processed foods
- Students write a short report on their findings and potential health impacts

## Personal Ultra-processed Food Diary
- Students keep a diary of their ultra-processed food consumption for a day
- They research and list healthier, minimally processed alternatives for each item
- Students reflect on challenges and opportunities for reducing their ultra-processed food intake

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Ultra-processed Food Myth Busters
- Present common myths or misconceptions about ultra-processed foods
- Students work in pairs to research and debunk these myths
- Pairs share their findings with the class

## Healthy Swap Challenge
- Display images of popular ultra-processed foods in Timor-Leste
- Students have 2 minutes to write down as many healthy, minimally processed alternatives as possible
- Share and discuss the alternatives as a class, focusing on local, traditional options

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned about ultra-processed foods and gut microbiota
- Volunteers share their responses, creating a summary of key takeaways from the lesson
