# Warm-up Activities

## Brain-Gut Connection Brainstorm
1. Display an image of the human body showing the brain, gut, and nervous system.
2. In pairs, students brainstorm possible ways these systems might communicate.
3. Pairs share ideas with the class; teacher records responses on the whiteboard.
4. Discuss and categorize responses into potential pathways (immune, endocrine, neural).

## Pathway Pictionary
1. Divide class into small groups.
2. Each group receives a key term (e.g., cytokines, vagus nerve, hormones).
3. Groups have 2 minutes to draw a representation of their term.
4. Other groups guess the term based on the drawing.
5. Winning team explains the term's role in the brain-gut-microbiota axis.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Pathway Exploration Stations
1. Set up three stations, each focusing on one pathway (neuroimmune, neuroendocrine, vagus nerve).
2. Students rotate through stations in small groups.
3. At each station, students:
   - Read a brief overview of the pathway
   - Watch a short video clip explaining its function
   - Complete a quick quiz or puzzle related to the pathway
4. Groups discuss their findings after visiting all stations.

## Interactive Lecture with Q&A
1. Present main content on each pathway using slides and diagrams.
2. After each pathway section, pause for a brief Q&A session.
3. Use real-life examples or case studies to illustrate pathway functions.
4. Encourage students to share relevant personal experiences or observations.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Timorese Lifestyle Analysis
1. Divide class into small groups.
2. Assign each group a Timorese lifestyle factor (e.g., traditional diet, stress levels, physical activity).
3. Groups research and analyze how their assigned factor might influence the three pathways.
4. Groups create a poster or digital presentation of their findings.
5. Each group presents their analysis to the class, followed by a brief discussion.

## Pathway Integration Puzzle
1. In pairs, students receive a set of cards with various components of the three pathways.
2. Pairs must arrange the cards to show how the pathways interact and influence each other.
3. Once arranged, pairs explain their reasoning to another pair.
4. Class discusses different arrangements and reaches a consensus on the most accurate representation.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Concept Map Creation
1. Provide students with a template or starting point for a concept map.
2. Students individually complete the concept map, showing connections between the three pathways.
3. Encourage use of colors, illustrations, and examples to enhance understanding.
4. Students write a brief explanation of their concept map.

## Case Study Analysis
1. Present a case study of a patient with symptoms related to disrupted brain-gut-microbiota communication.
2. Students individually analyze the case, identifying potential pathway disruptions.
3. Students propose interventions targeting each pathway to improve the patient's condition.
4. Share and discuss responses as a class.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Pathway Jeopardy
1. Create a Jeopardy-style game with categories for each pathway and their interactions.
2. Divide class into teams to compete.
3. Use game to review key concepts and address any remaining questions or misconceptions.

## Reflection and Application
1. Students write a brief reflection on how the lesson content relates to their own health and lifestyle.
2. In small groups, students discuss potential changes they could make to positively influence their brain-gut-microbiota axis.
3. As a class, brainstorm ways to share this knowledge with the broader Timorese community.

## One-Minute Paper
1. Students have one minute to write down the most important thing they learned and one question they still have.
2. Collect papers and address common questions or misconceptions before dismissing class.
3. Use responses to inform future lessons or review sessions.
