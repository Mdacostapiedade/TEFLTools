# Warm-up Activities

## Food and Mood Gallery Walk

1. Set up stations around the room with images of various Timorese foods and descriptions of their nutrient content.
2. Students walk around the room, observing each station.
3. At each station, students write on a sticky note how they think the food might impact mental health.
4. Discuss observations as a class, introducing key concepts of nutritional psychiatry.

## Epigenetics Word Cloud

1. Provide students with sticky notes and markers.
2. Ask them to write words or phrases they associate with "epigenetics" or "gene expression."
3. Create a collective word cloud on the board with their contributions.
4. Use this as a starting point to discuss and clarify misconceptions about epigenetics.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Epigenetics Simulation

1. Divide the class into groups representing different genes.
2. Provide each group with a set of cards representing various environmental factors (e.g., stress, nutrition, toxins).
3. Groups discuss how each factor might affect their gene's expression.
4. Share findings with the class, emphasizing the dynamic nature of epigenetic changes.

## Nutritional Programming Timeline

1. Create a large timeline on the wall representing the human lifespan.
2. Provide students with cards describing critical periods and key nutrients.
3. Students place cards on the timeline and explain their choices.
4. Discuss how nutritional programming applies to the Timorese context.

## Lifestyle Psychiatry Case Studies

1. Present several case studies of individuals with mental health concerns in Timor-Leste.
2. In small groups, students develop lifestyle intervention plans for each case.
3. Groups present their plans, focusing on culturally appropriate strategies.
4. Class discusses the potential challenges and benefits of each approach.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Public Health Campaign Development

1. Divide the class into small groups.
2. Assign each group a specific mental health issue prevalent in Timor-Leste.
3. Groups create a public health campaign incorporating epigenetics and nutritional programming concepts.
4. Campaigns should include a slogan, key messages, and proposed implementation strategies.
5. Groups present their campaigns to the class for feedback.

## Epigenetic Influences Mind Map

1. In pairs, students create a mind map of potential epigenetic influences on mental health in Timor-Leste.
2. Include categories such as diet, stress, environmental toxins, and cultural practices.
3. Pairs share their mind maps, discussing similarities and differences.
4. Class compiles a comprehensive list of epigenetic influences relevant to Timor-Leste.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personalized Nutrition and Lifestyle Plan

1. Provide students with a hypothetical patient profile, including age, gender, occupation, and mental health concerns.
2. Students create a personalized nutrition and lifestyle plan for the patient.
3. Plans should consider local food availability, cultural practices, and potential epigenetic influences.
4. Students write a brief rationale for their recommendations.

## Epigenetics and Traditional Practices Research

1. Students choose a traditional Timorese food or practice to research.
2. They investigate its potential impact on epigenetics and mental health.
3. Students write a short report summarizing their findings and suggesting how this knowledge could be incorporated into lifestyle psychiatry approaches.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Concept Connection Game

1. Create cards with key terms and concepts from the lesson.
2. Students draw cards and must explain how their concept connects to another student's concept.
3. Continue until all concepts have been linked, creating a web of understanding.

## Reflection Journaling

1. Provide students with prompts related to the lesson content:
   - How might understanding epigenetics change your approach to mental health care?
   - What challenges do you foresee in implementing lifestyle psychiatry in Timor-Leste?
   - How can you apply today's learning to your future practice?
2. Students spend 5-10 minutes writing reflective responses.
3. Invite volunteers to share their reflections with the class.

## One-Minute Paper

1. In the last minute of class, ask students to write down:
   - The most important thing they learned today
   - One question they still have about the topic
2. Collect papers as students leave to inform future lessons and address any remaining confusion.
