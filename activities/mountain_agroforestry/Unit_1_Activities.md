# Warm-up Activities

## Photo Analysis
1. Display a series of photos showing mountain farms in Timor-Leste.
2. Students work in pairs to analyze each photo, discussing:
   - What crops they can identify
   - Potential challenges for farmers in this environment
   - Possible advantages of farming in this location
3. Pairs share their observations with the class.

## Mountain Agriculture Word Cloud
1. Students brainstorm words related to mountain agriculture.
2. Create a collaborative word cloud using an online tool.
3. Discuss the most prominent words and their significance.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Interactive Map Exploration
1. Using a digital map of Timor-Leste, highlight major mountain ranges and agricultural areas.
2. Students take turns identifying key geographic features and discussing their potential impact on agriculture.

## Climate Change Impact Simulation
1. Divide the class into groups representing different mountain regions.
2. Provide each group with climate change scenario cards (e.g., increased temperature, altered rainfall patterns).
3. Groups discuss and present how these changes might affect agriculture in their assigned region.

## Traditional Farming Practices Jigsaw
1. Assign students to expert groups, each focusing on a specific traditional farming practice.
2. Expert groups research their assigned practice and prepare to teach others.
3. Regroup students so each new group has one expert from each practice.
4. Students teach each other about the different practices.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Elevation Crop Matching Game
1. Create cards with different crops and elevation ranges.
2. In pairs, students match crops to their suitable elevation ranges.
3. Discuss results as a class, explaining the reasoning behind each match.

## Climate Change Adaptation Strategies
1. In small groups, students brainstorm potential strategies for adapting mountain agriculture to climate change.
2. Groups create posters illustrating their top 3 strategies.
3. Gallery walk to view and discuss all groups' ideas.

## Farm Layout Design Challenge
1. Provide groups with a hypothetical mountain plot description (slope, soil type, water access).
2. Groups design a farm layout incorporating sustainable practices learned in the lesson.
3. Present designs to the class, explaining their choices.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Mountain Agriculture Concept Map
Students create individual concept maps linking key terms and ideas from the lesson (e.g., terracing, intercropping, climate resilience).

## Farmer Interview Question Preparation
Students prepare a list of 5-10 questions they would like to ask mountain farmers during the field trip.

## Climate Impact Analysis
Students write a short paragraph describing how one specific climate change factor (e.g., increased temperature) might impact a traditional mountain crop in Timor-Leste.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 3-2-1 Reflection
Students write down:
- 3 things they learned
- 2 things they found interesting
- 1 question they still have

## Mountain Agriculture Pictionary
1. Divide the class into teams.
2. Students take turns drawing key concepts from the lesson while their team guesses.

## Exit Ticket
Before leaving, students complete a brief form answering:
1. What was the most important thing you learned today?
2. How might this information be useful for mountain communities in Timor-Leste?
3. What topic would you like to explore further in our next lesson?
