# Warm-up Activities

## Erosion Demonstration
- Fill a tray with soil and tilt it at an angle
- Pour water over the soil to simulate rainfall
- Observe and discuss how the soil erodes

## Photo Analysis
- Show students photos of eroded mountain slopes
- In pairs, discuss potential causes and impacts
- Share ideas with the class

# Main Lesson Activities

## Terracing Lecture
- Present different types of terraces using diagrams and photos
- Explain benefits and construction techniques
- Show video clips of terrace farming in action

## Water Harvesting Exploration
- Introduce basic rainwater harvesting techniques
- Discuss storage options and potential uses
- Show examples of successful systems in similar regions

## Mulching and Cover Cropping Demo
- Set up small plots with different mulch materials
- Plant cover crop seeds in another plot
- Explain benefits and management techniques

# Group Work Tasks

## Terrace Building Challenge
- Divide class into small groups
- Provide materials (stakes, string, small shovels, etc.)
- Challenge groups to build a model terrace
- Present and explain designs to the class

## Water Harvesting Design Project
- In pairs, design a rainwater harvesting system for a hypothetical mountain farm
- Draw plans and explain component functions
- Present designs to the class for feedback

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Contour Line Mapping
- Provide topographic maps of local mountain areas
- Students practice drawing contour lines for farming
- Identify best locations for terraces and water harvesting

## Soil Conservation Technique Matching
- Create cards with soil conservation techniques and their benefits
- Students match techniques to appropriate scenarios or landscapes

# Cool-down Activities

## One Thing, One Question
- Students share one new thing they learned and one question they still have
- Address remaining questions as a class

## Conservation Technique Charades
- Write soil and water conservation techniques on slips of paper
- Students take turns acting out techniques for others to guess

## Reflection Journal
- Students write a brief reflection on how they might apply these techniques in their own communities or future work
