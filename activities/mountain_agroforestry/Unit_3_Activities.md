# Warm-up Activities

## Climate Change Impact Brainstorm
- In small groups, students brainstorm and list potential impacts of climate change on mountain agriculture in Timor-Leste
- Groups share their ideas with the class, creating a master list on the board

## Crop Variety Matching Game
- Students receive cards with names of local crop varieties and climate conditions
- They must match the crops to the most suitable conditions, discussing their choices

# Main Lesson Activities

## Climate-Resilient Crop Showcase
- Instructor presents samples of climate-resilient crop varieties
- Students examine the seeds and plants, noting unique characteristics
- Class discussion on how these traits contribute to resilience

## Crop Rotation Simulation
- Using a large grid on the floor, students act as different crops
- They rotate positions based on instructor cues, demonstrating crop rotation principles
- Debrief on benefits observed during the simulation

## Intercropping Puzzle
- Students receive puzzle pieces representing different crops
- They must arrange the pieces to create beneficial intercropping combinations
- Groups explain their arrangements to the class

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Design a Climate-Resilient Farm
- In small groups, students design a hypothetical mountain farm
- They must incorporate climate-resilient varieties, crop rotation, and intercropping
- Groups present their designs using flipchart paper or digital tools

## Agroforestry System Model
- Pairs create a 3D model of an agroforestry system using craft materials
- They label different components and explain interactions between trees and crops
- Models are displayed for a gallery walk

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Crop Rotation Planning Sheet
- Students receive a worksheet with a 4-year grid
- They plan a crop rotation sequence for a specific set of crops
- Instructor reviews plans individually, providing feedback

## Climate-Resilient Variety Research
- Each student selects a climate-resilient crop variety to research
- They create a fact sheet including growing conditions, benefits, and potential challenges
- Fact sheets are compiled into a class reference guide

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Sustainable Agriculture Pictionary
- Students take turns drawing concepts from the lesson while others guess
- Emphasize key vocabulary and main ideas covered

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned and one question they still have
- Instructor collects papers to assess understanding and address remaining questions in the next lesson

## Crop Diversity Pledge
- Students write a personal pledge on how they will promote crop diversity in their future work or personal gardens
- Volunteers share their pledges with the class
