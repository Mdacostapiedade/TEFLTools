# Warm-up Activities

## Mountain Livestock Charades
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group draws a card with a mountain livestock challenge (e.g., steep grazing, predators, harsh weather)
- Groups act out the challenge without speaking while others guess

## Photo Analysis
- Display photos of different mountain livestock systems
- Students work in pairs to identify animals, housing, and potential challenges
- Share observations with the class

# Main Lesson Activities

## Fodder Crop Exploration
- Set up stations with samples or images of local fodder crops
- Students rotate through stations, noting characteristics and potential benefits
- Discuss findings as a class, highlighting suitability for mountain conditions

## Manure Management Demonstration
- Use props or diagrams to demonstrate proper manure collection and storage
- Students participate in a step-by-step walkthrough of the process
- Discuss benefits and challenges of manure management in mountain areas

## Small Ruminant Housing Design
- Present different materials suitable for goat/sheep housing
- Students sketch a simple shelter design, considering mountain weather and predator protection
- Share designs and discuss pros and cons of each approach

# Group Work Tasks

## Mountain Farm Scenario Planning
- Divide class into small groups
- Provide each group with a unique mountain farm scenario
- Groups develop a comprehensive plan for livestock integration, fodder production, and manure management
- Present plans to the class for feedback

## Fodder Production Debate
- Assign groups different fodder crops suitable for mountain areas
- Groups research and prepare arguments for why their crop is best
- Conduct a structured debate, with groups presenting and rebutting arguments

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Integrated Farm Sketch
- Students individually create a detailed sketch of an integrated crop-livestock mountain farm
- Include livestock areas, fodder plots, manure management systems, and crop fields
- Add brief explanations for each component of the design

## Breed Selection Activity
- Provide a list of small ruminant breeds with varying characteristics
- Students choose the most appropriate breeds for a given mountain scenario
- Write a short justification for their selections

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## Mountain Livestock Management Quiz
- Conduct a quick, interactive quiz on key concepts from the lesson
- Use a platform like Kahoot! or simple hand-raising for answers
- Discuss correct answers and address any misconceptions

## Reflection Circle
- Form a circle with the class
- Each student shares one new thing they learned and one question they still have
- Address outstanding questions and summarize key takeaways

## Future Vision Exercise
- Students write a brief paragraph describing their vision for sustainable livestock management in Timor-Leste's mountains 10 years from now
- Volunteers share their visions with the class
- Discuss how today's lesson contributes to achieving these future goals
