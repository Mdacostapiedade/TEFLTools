# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Post-Harvest Challenge Gallery Walk

- Create posters around the room with different post-harvest challenges (e.g., pest infestation, spoilage, transportation damage).
- Students walk around, writing potential solutions on sticky notes and attaching them to the posters.
- Discuss the most creative or effective solutions as a class.

## 2. Crop Sorting Relay

- Divide the class into teams.
- Set up baskets with mixed "crops" (use colored balls or fruit-shaped stress balls).
- Teams race to sort the crops into appropriate storage containers based on type and quality.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Storage Structure Design Challenge

- Provide groups with basic materials (e.g., popsicle sticks, cardboard, string).
- Each group designs and builds a small-scale model of a storage structure for a specific mountain crop.
- Groups present their designs, explaining how they address local climate and pest challenges.

## 2. Value Addition Demonstration Stations

- Set up stations around the room showcasing different value addition techniques (e.g., solar drying, grinding spices, packaging).
- Students rotate through stations, trying out each technique and noting potential applications for local crops.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Marketing Plan Development

- In groups of 3-4, students choose a local mountain product and develop a comprehensive marketing plan.
- Groups create a visual presentation (poster or digital) including product branding, packaging design, and promotion strategies.

## 2. Post-Harvest Loss Reduction Strategies

- Pairs are assigned a specific crop and stage of the supply chain (e.g., harvesting, transportation, storage).
- They research and present practical strategies to reduce losses at their assigned stage.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Crop Storage Matchmaking

- Provide a worksheet with various crops and storage conditions.
- Students match each crop to its ideal storage method and explain their reasoning.

## 2. Value Chain Analysis

- Students choose a mountain product and create a flowchart showing its journey from farm to consumer.
- They identify potential points for value addition and loss reduction along the chain.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. One-Minute Paper

- Students write for one minute on: "The most important thing I learned today about post-harvest handling is..."
- Share responses in small groups or with the whole class.

## 2. Post-Harvest Handling Pictionary

- Divide the class into teams.
- One member from each team draws a concept from the lesson (e.g., solar drying, fair trade certification) while their team guesses.
- First team to guess correctly earns a point.

## 3. Reflection Circle

- Students stand in a circle and take turns sharing one new technique they learned and how they might apply it in their community.
