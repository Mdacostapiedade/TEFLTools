# Warm-up Activities

## Environmental Impact Bingo

1. Create a bingo card with various environmental impacts (both positive and negative) related to agriculture.
2. As students share ideas during the brainstorming session, have them mark off corresponding squares on their bingo cards.
3. The first student to get a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) calls out "Bingo!" and shares their marked impacts with the class.

## Picture Association

1. Display images related to mushroom cultivation and environmental sustainability on the projector.
2. Ask students to write down the first word or phrase that comes to mind for each image.
3. Discuss the associations as a class, introducing key concepts and vocabulary.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Mushroom Waste Management Demonstration

1. Set up a small-scale demonstration of mushrooms breaking down agricultural waste.
2. Use clear containers with different types of agricultural waste common in Timor-Leste.
3. Show students the progress of decomposition over time (using pre-prepared samples at different stages).
4. Discuss the implications for waste management and soil health.

## Water Usage Comparison Chart

1. Create a large chart comparing water usage for various crops, including mushrooms.
2. Have students place sticky notes with water usage amounts on the chart for different crops.
3. Reveal the actual amounts and discuss the water efficiency of mushroom cultivation.

## Climate Resilience Role-Play

1. Assign students roles as farmers facing different climate challenges in Timor-Leste.
2. Introduce the concept of mushroom cultivation as a potential solution.
3. Have students act out scenarios where they incorporate mushroom cultivation into their farming practices.
4. Discuss the outcomes and potential benefits as a class.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Case Study Jigsaw

1. Divide the class into "expert" groups, each focusing on a different aspect of environmental sustainability in mushroom farming.
2. Have expert groups analyze their assigned aspect in the case study.
3. Regroup students into "teaching" groups with one expert from each aspect.
4. Students share their expertise with their new group to build a comprehensive understanding of the case study.

## Sustainable Mushroom Farm Design Challenge

1. In pairs, students design a small-scale, environmentally-friendly mushroom production system for Timor-Leste.
2. Provide a checklist of environmental considerations to incorporate (e.g., water efficiency, waste management, energy use).
3. Have pairs create a visual representation of their design using provided materials.
4. Pairs present their designs to neighboring pairs for feedback before finalizing.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Environmental Impact Assessment

1. Provide students with a hypothetical mushroom farm scenario.
2. Ask them to conduct a mini environmental impact assessment, identifying potential positive and negative impacts.
3. Have them propose mitigation strategies for any negative impacts identified.

## Circular Economy Diagram

1. Give students a template of a circular economy diagram.
2. Ask them to fill in the diagram with specific examples related to mushroom cultivation in Timor-Leste.
3. Encourage them to think about inputs, outputs, and how waste can become a resource.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Three-Two-One Reflection

1. Ask students to write down:
   - Three new things they learned
   - Two ways mushroom cultivation could benefit Timor-Leste's environment
   - One question they still have

## Sustainable Mushroom Cultivation Infographic

1. As a class, create a simple infographic summarizing the key environmental benefits of mushroom cultivation.
2. Assign different sections to small groups of students to complete.
3. Combine the sections into a cohesive infographic that can be displayed in the classroom.

## Exit Ticket: Environmental Challenge Solution

1. Have students write a brief exit ticket proposing how mushroom cultivation could address one specific environmental challenge in Timor-Leste.
2. Collect the exit tickets to assess understanding and gather ideas for future discussions.
