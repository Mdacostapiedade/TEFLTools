# Warm-up Activities

## Mushroom Handling Relay Race
- Divide the class into teams
- Set up stations with different mushroom species and handling tools
- Teams race to correctly harvest, package, and store mushrooms at each station
- Discuss proper techniques and common mistakes after the race

## Quality Control Scavenger Hunt
- Hide pictures of mushrooms with various quality issues around the classroom
- Students search for the pictures and categorize the issues they find
- Discuss findings as a class and introduce key quality control concepts

# Main Lesson Activities

## Harvesting Technique Demonstration
- Instructor demonstrates proper harvesting techniques for different mushroom species
- Students take notes and ask questions
- Highlight the importance of gentle handling and avoiding damage to fruiting bodies

## Post-Harvest Handling Simulation
- Set up stations representing different stages of post-harvest handling
- Students rotate through stations, practicing cooling, cleaning, and packaging techniques
- Discuss the importance of each step in maintaining mushroom quality

## Food Safety Scenario Analysis
- Present students with various food safety scenarios related to mushroom production
- In small groups, students identify potential risks and propose solutions
- Groups share their analyses with the class, fostering discussion on best practices

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Quality Control Checklist Development
- In pairs, students create a comprehensive quality control checklist for small-scale mushroom producers
- Checklists should cover harvesting, handling, storage, and food safety considerations
- Pairs exchange checklists and provide feedback to each other

## Post-Harvest Handling Flowchart Creation
- In small groups, students create a visual flowchart of the post-harvest handling process
- Groups present their flowcharts to the class, explaining each step and its importance
- Class discusses and compares different approaches

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Mushroom Grading Exercise
- Provide students with a variety of mushroom samples (or high-quality photos)
- Students individually grade the mushrooms based on appearance, size, and quality
- Compare and discuss grading results as a class

## Storage Condition Analysis
- Give students data on different storage conditions (temperature, humidity, packaging)
- Students analyze the data and determine optimal storage conditions for various mushroom species
- Write a brief report explaining their conclusions and recommendations

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Quality Control Jeopardy
- Create a Jeopardy-style game with categories related to harvesting, handling, storage, and food safety
- Divide the class into teams to compete and reinforce key concepts
- Discuss any questions or misconceptions that arise during the game

## Reflection and Application
- Students write a brief reflection on how they can apply the lesson's concepts to mushroom production in Timor-Leste
- Share reflections in small groups or with the whole class
- Discuss potential challenges and solutions for implementing quality control measures locally
