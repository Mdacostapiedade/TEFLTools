# Warm-up Activities

## Mushroom Tasting Challenge
- Provide students with small samples of different mushroom species prepared in various ways (raw, cooked, powdered)
- Students taste each sample and write down flavors, textures, and potential uses
- Discuss findings as a class, introducing key mushroom varieties

## Mushroom Application Brainstorm
- In pairs, students brainstorm as many applications of mushrooms as they can think of in 3 minutes
- Share ideas with the class, categorizing them into food, medicine, and environmental uses

# Main Lesson Activities

## Interactive Presentation
- Deliver the main lesson content using a multimedia presentation
- Incorporate short video clips of mushroom cultivation and mycoremediation projects
- Pause periodically for quick comprehension checks and questions

## Mushroom Product Gallery Walk
- Set up stations around the room with examples of mushroom-based products (foods, supplements, medicines)
- Students rotate through stations, examining products and reading about their uses and benefits
- Students take notes on the most interesting or surprising applications

# Group Work Tasks

## Culinary Innovation Challenge
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group develops a new mushroom-based dish or product for the Timorese market
- Groups create a brief presentation including recipe, target market, and potential health benefits

## Mycoremediation Project Design
- Assign each group a specific polluted site in Timor-Leste
- Groups design a basic mycoremediation project for their site, including:
  * Selection of appropriate mushroom species
  * Substrate preparation methods
  * Implementation strategy
  * Monitoring and evaluation plan
- Groups present their designs to the class for feedback

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Medicinal Mushroom Research
- Students individually research a medicinal mushroom species with potential for cultivation in Timor-Leste
- Create a one-page fact sheet on the mushroom, including:
  * Bioactive compounds
  * Traditional and modern medicinal uses
  * Cultivation requirements
  * Potential applications in Timor-Leste

## Mushroom Application Matching
- Provide a worksheet with various mushroom species and their potential applications
- Students match the mushrooms to their most suitable applications based on properties and characteristics

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## Mushroom Application Pyramid
- As a class, create a pyramid diagram of mushroom applications
- Place the most promising applications for Timor-Leste at the top
- Discuss the reasoning behind the placement and potential impact of each application

## Key Concept Quiz
- Administer a quick quiz covering the main concepts from the lesson
- Review answers as a class, clarifying any misunderstandings

## Reflection Journal
- Students spend 5 minutes writing in a reflection journal, answering prompts such as:
  * What was the most surprising thing you learned about mushrooms today?
  * How do you think mushrooms could benefit your local community?
  * What questions do you still have about mushroom applications?
