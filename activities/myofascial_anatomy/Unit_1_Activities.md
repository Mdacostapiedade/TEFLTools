# Warm-up Activities

## Body Awareness Meditation (5 minutes)
- Students sit comfortably and close their eyes
- Guide them to focus on different parts of their body, starting from toes to head
- Ask them to notice any sensations, tensions, or connections they feel

## Fascial Stretch Circle (5 minutes)
- Form a circle and lead students through gentle, full-body stretches
- Emphasize slow, fluid movements to engage the fascial system
- Encourage students to notice how stretching one area affects others

# Main Lesson Activities

## Fascia Dissection Video Analysis (10 minutes)
- Show a short video of fascial dissection
- Students take notes on fascia's appearance and properties
- Discuss observations as a class, relating to key vocabulary

## Tensegrity Model Building (15 minutes)
- Provide materials (straws, elastic bands) to build simple tensegrity models
- Students construct models and experiment with applying force
- Relate the models to the concept of myofascial force transmission

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Cultural Connection Brainstorm (15 minutes)
- In small groups, students brainstorm traditional Timorese practices related to body interconnectedness
- Groups create mind maps linking these practices to fascial concepts
- Each group presents their top connections to the class

## Myofascial Continuity Demonstration (20 minutes)
- In pairs, one student lies on a mat while the other gently applies pressure to different body parts
- The receiving student describes any sensations felt in distant areas
- Partners switch roles and discuss their experiences

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Fascia Palpation Stations (15 minutes)
- Set up stations with different textures representing fascial layers (e.g., silk, felt, rubber bands)
- Students rotate through stations, practicing palpation techniques
- They record observations and compare fascial textures to body tissues

## Myofascial Self-Release Technique Practice (10 minutes)
- Demonstrate self-release techniques using foam rollers
- Students practice techniques on themselves, focusing on major fascial lines
- Encourage them to note any changes in sensation or mobility

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Fascial Integration Visualization (5 minutes)
- Guide students through a visualization of their fascial network
- Have them imagine movement flowing through their myofascial continuities
- End with a focus on whole-body integration and connectivity

## Key Concept Relay (10 minutes)
- Divide class into teams and line up at one end of the room
- Place vocabulary cards at the other end
- Students run to pick a card, return to their team, and collaboratively define the term
- Continue until all terms are defined, then review as a class
