# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Back Line Awareness Walk (5 minutes)
- Students walk around the room, focusing on the sensation of the back of their body
- Cue students to exaggerate the movement of their heels, calves, hamstrings, and back muscles
- Encourage them to notice how these areas connect and influence each other

## 2. Partner Back Tracing (5 minutes)
- Students pair up and take turns tracing their partner's spine with their fingertips
- The receiving partner focuses on the sensation and tries to breathe into the areas being touched
- Switch roles after 2-3 minutes

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. SBL Component Relay (15 minutes)
- Divide the class into small groups
- Each group receives a set of cards with SBL components written on them
- Groups must arrange the cards in the correct order from toes to head as quickly as possible
- The first team to correctly arrange the cards wins

## 2. Living Anatomy Model (20 minutes)
- Select a volunteer to be the "model"
- Use washable markers to draw the SBL on the model's body
- As you draw each component, explain its function and connection to adjacent structures
- Encourage students to ask questions and make observations

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. SBL Stretch Sequence Design (20 minutes)
- In pairs or small groups, students create a stretch sequence that targets the entire SBL
- Groups should incorporate at least one traditional Timorese movement or posture
- Each group demonstrates their sequence to the class

## 2. Postural Analysis Gallery Walk (15 minutes)
- Post images of people in various postures around the room
- In pairs, students rotate through the images, analyzing SBL involvement in each posture
- Pairs discuss potential implications and write their observations on sticky notes next to each image

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. SBL Self-Palpation (10 minutes)
- Guide students through a self-palpation exercise of their own SBL
- Start at the toes and work up to the head, pausing at each major component
- Encourage students to note areas of tension or discomfort

## 2. SBL Movement Exploration Journal (15 minutes)
- Students individually explore movements that emphasize different parts of the SBL
- They document their experiences in a journal, noting sensations and observations
- Prompt them to relate their findings to daily activities or traditional Timorese movements

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. SBL Relaxation Visualization (5 minutes)
- Guide students through a relaxation exercise focusing on the SBL
- Have them lie on their backs and visualize each component of the SBL releasing tension
- Incorporate deep breathing to enhance relaxation

## 2. One-Minute Paper (5 minutes)
- Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned about the SBL
- Collect the papers and quickly review them, addressing any common misconceptions or interesting insights

## 3. SBL Concept Map (10 minutes)
- As a class, create a concept map on the whiteboard linking key SBL components and functions
- Encourage students to contribute ideas and make connections
- Use this as a visual summary of the lesson's main points
