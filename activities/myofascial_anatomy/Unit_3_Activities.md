# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Myofascial Wake-Up

- Students stand in a circle
- Lead a gentle, full-body stretch sequence focusing on the Superficial Front Line and Lateral Line
- Incorporate slow, controlled movements like forward folds, side bends, and arm reaches
- Encourage students to feel the connections between different body parts as they move

## 2. Line-Up Balance Challenge

- Students form a line, standing side by side
- The person on one end starts a gentle lean to the side
- Each person follows, creating a wave-like motion down the line
- Challenge: maintain balance while connected to neighbors
- Discuss how the Lateral Line is engaged during this activity

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Anatomy Trains Mapping

- Divide class into small groups
- Provide large sheets of paper and colored markers
- Groups draw life-size outlines of a body
- Task: Map out the Superficial Front Line and Lateral Line on the body outline
- Groups present their maps, explaining key points and connections

## 2. Movement Analysis Station Rotation

- Set up stations around the room with videos or images of Timorese dance and martial arts movements
- Students rotate through stations in small groups
- At each station, analyze how the Superficial Front Line and Lateral Line are engaged
- Record observations and discuss findings as a class

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Myofascial Storytelling

- In pairs, students create a short story or scenario involving daily Timorese activities
- Task: Act out the story, emphasizing movements that engage the Superficial Front Line and Lateral Line
- Partners provide feedback on which lines they observe being used

## 2. Palpation Exploration

- In pairs, one student lies on a mat while the other palpates the components of the Superficial Front Line and Lateral Line
- Guide students through each line, discussing texture, tension, and connections
- Switch roles and repeat

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Myofascial Self-Massage

- Provide foam rollers and therapy balls
- Demonstrate self-massage techniques for key points along the Superficial Front Line and Lateral Line
- Students practice individually, focusing on areas of tension or interest

## 2. Movement Integration Journaling

- Students choose a common Timorese activity (e.g., farming, fishing, weaving)
- Write a detailed description of how the Superficial Front Line and Lateral Line are engaged in this activity
- Sketch the movement, highlighting the myofascial lines involved

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Myofascial Meridian Meditation

- Guide students through a seated meditation
- Focus on breath and body awareness, drawing attention to the paths of the Superficial Front Line and Lateral Line
- Encourage visualization of these lines as connected, fluid pathways in the body

## 2. Collaborative Line Art

- Provide a large canvas or paper on the wall
- Students take turns adding to a collective drawing representing the Superficial Front Line and Lateral Line
- Encourage creative interpretation, using colors, symbols, or Timorese cultural elements
- Discuss the final artwork as a class, relating it to the day's learning
