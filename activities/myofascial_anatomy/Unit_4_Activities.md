# Warm-up Activities

## Spiral Movement Exploration
- In pairs, students guide each other through a full-body spiral movement
- Start from the feet, gradually rotating up through the legs, torso, and arms
- Discuss sensations and which body parts felt most engaged

## Arm Line Awakening
- Students stand in a circle and perform arm movements that engage each Arm Line:
  * Reach forward (Superficial Front Arm Line)
  * Pull back (Superficial Back Arm Line)
  * Push down (Deep Front Arm Line)
  * Lift up (Deep Back Arm Line)
- Encourage awareness of how these movements connect to the trunk

# Main Lesson Activities

## Spiral Line Mapping
- Using anatomical charts, students trace the path of the Spiral Line on a partner's body
- Identify key anatomical landmarks and muscles involved

## Arm Line Connection Game
- Students form groups of four
- Each group member represents one Arm Line
- Create a physical "connection" by linking arms in ways that demonstrate how the Arm Lines integrate with the trunk and each other

## Timorese Craft Analysis
- Display images or videos of traditional Timorese crafts (e.g., weaving, pottery)
- Students identify and discuss which myofascial lines are primarily engaged in these activities

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Spiral Line Movement Sequence
- In pairs or small groups, create a movement sequence that highlights the function of the Spiral Line
- Incorporate rotational movements and contralateral patterns
- Present sequences to the class and discuss observations

## Arm Line Assessment Practice
- In pairs, students take turns assessing each other's Arm Lines
- Use resistance bands to test the integrity and function of each line
- Document findings and discuss any imbalances or restrictions observed

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Myofascial Line Drawing
- Provide blank body outlines
- Students individually draw and label the Spiral Line and Arm Lines
- Add notes on key functions and connections to other myofascial meridians

## Self-Palpation Exploration
- Guide students through a self-palpation exercise of the Spiral Line and Arm Lines
- Encourage awareness of tissue quality, tension, and connections between different body regions

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Myofascial Integration Visualization
- Lead a guided visualization where students imagine the Spiral Line and Arm Lines lighting up during various movements
- Include everyday Timorese activities in the visualization

## Quick Quiz: Line Identification
- Show images or demonstrate movements related to Timorese daily activities or crafts
- Students quickly identify which myofascial line(s) are primarily involved
- Discuss answers as a group, emphasizing the integration of multiple lines in complex movements

## Reflection Circle
- Form a standing circle
- Each student shares one key insight they gained about the Spiral Line or Arm Lines and how it relates to their understanding of movement in Timorese culture
