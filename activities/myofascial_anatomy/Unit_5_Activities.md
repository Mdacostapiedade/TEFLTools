# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Spinal Wave Partner Guide (10 minutes)
- Students pair up
- One partner lies on their back, the other guides them through a gentle spinal wave movement
- Start from the tailbone, slowly moving up to the head
- Emphasize the connection through the core of the body
- Switch roles after 5 minutes

## 2. Deep Front Line Awakening (5 minutes)
- Students stand in a circle
- Guide them through a series of movements:
  * Lift and spread toes, pressing into the inner arch
  * Engage the inner thigh muscles
  * Gently draw the lower belly in and up
  * Breathe deeply, focusing on rib cage expansion
  * Lift the chest and lengthen the neck
  * Gently press the tongue to the roof of the mouth

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Deep Front Line Mapping (15 minutes)
- Provide large outline drawings of the human body
- In small groups, students draw the path of the Deep Front Line
- Use anatomy charts and textbooks as references
- Groups present their maps, discussing any differences

## 2. Breathing Visualization (10 minutes)
- Students lie on their backs with hands on lower ribs
- Guide them through diaphragmatic breathing
- Visualize the connection between the diaphragm, pelvic floor, and abdominal muscles
- Imagine the breath traveling along the Deep Front Line

## 3. Cultural Connection Discussion (10 minutes)
- Facilitate a group discussion on:
  * Traditional Timorese breathing practices in martial arts or meditation
  * Core-intensive activities in daily Timorese life
  * How these relate to the Deep Front Line concept

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Deep Front Line Palpation (15 minutes)
- In pairs, students take turns palpating accessible parts of the Deep Front Line
- Focus areas:
  * Inner ankle and foot
  * Inner calf and knee
  * Inner thigh
  * Lower abdominal wall
  * Discuss sensations and connections felt

## 2. Core Stability Assessment (20 minutes)
- Teach the Active Straight Leg Raise test
- In pairs, students perform the test on each other
- Discuss how the Deep Front Line is involved in maintaining stability
- Explore ways to improve core engagement during the test

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Psoas Release (10 minutes)
- Demonstrate a gentle psoas release technique using a foam roller
- Students practice individually, focusing on breath and relaxation
- Encourage awareness of how this affects their core and overall posture

## 2. Diaphragm Breathing Journal (5 minutes)
- Students find a comfortable position
- Practice diaphragmatic breathing for 3-5 minutes
- Write brief notes on sensations, challenges, and insights

## 3. Deep Front Line Stretch Sequence (10 minutes)
- Guide students through a series of stretches targeting the Deep Front Line:
  * Calf and inner thigh stretch
  * Gentle backbend focusing on the front of the body
  * Neck and throat stretch
- Students perform these individually, noting any areas of tension or release

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Deep Front Line Movement Integration (10 minutes)
- Students create a short movement sequence that engages the Deep Front Line
- Incorporate elements of traditional Timorese movement if possible
- Share sequences in small groups, discussing how they relate to the Deep Front Line

## 2. Reflection Circle (5 minutes)
- Form a standing circle
- Each student shares one key insight or question about the Deep Front Line
- Encourage connections to personal experience or cultural practices

## 3. Grounding Visualization (5 minutes)
- Guide students through a brief visualization:
  * Imagine roots growing from the inner arches of the feet
  * Feel these roots connecting through the Deep Front Line to the core
  * Extend this connection up through the spine to the skull
  * Take three deep breaths, feeling stable and grounded
- Close the class with a traditional Timorese gesture or phrase of gratitude
