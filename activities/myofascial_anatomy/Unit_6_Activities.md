# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Myofascial Line Tag

- Students move around the room, tagging each other along specific myofascial lines
- When tagged, students must freeze and can only be unfrozen by another student tracing the complete line

## 2. Fascial Stretch Circle

- Form a circle, holding hands
- One person initiates a stretch, which travels through the circle like a wave
- Focus on feeling the fascial connection between participants

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Myofascial Meridian Mapping

- In small groups, students use colored tape to map out all major Anatomy Trains lines on a volunteer
- Groups present their maps, explaining the connections and functions of each line

## 2. Cultural Posture Analysis

- Students analyze photos of traditional Timorese activities and postures
- Identify which myofascial lines are most engaged in each posture
- Discuss how these cultural patterns might influence assessment and treatment

## 3. Compensatory Pattern Detective

- Instructor demonstrates various compensatory patterns
- Students work in pairs to identify the primary restriction and resulting compensations
- Discuss how these patterns might manifest differently in Timorese vs. Western bodies

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Treatment Strategy Role-Play

- In pairs, one student plays a client with a specific myofascial imbalance
- The other student conducts an assessment and develops a treatment plan
- Switch roles and repeat
- Discuss how to adapt the approach for Timorese cultural norms

## 2. Myofascial Movement Sequence Design

- In small groups, create a movement sequence that flows through all major myofascial meridians
- Incorporate elements of traditional Timorese movement practices
- Groups teach their sequences to the class

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Self-Assessment Journaling

- Students perform a self-assessment using the Anatomy Trains framework
- Journal about personal myofascial patterns, potential cultural influences, and ideas for self-treatment

## 2. Palpation Stations

- Set up stations with different textures and densities representing various fascial structures
- Students rotate through stations, practicing palpation skills and noting observations

## 3. Myofascial Line Drawing

- Provide blank body outlines
- Students draw and label all major myofascial meridians from memory
- Add notes on key points, functions, and cultural considerations

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Fascial Unwinding Circle

- Form a circle, with one person in the center
- The center person closes their eyes and allows subtle movements to emerge
- Others support and gently guide the movement, encouraging full-body fascial release

## 2. Integration Visualization

- Guided visualization connecting all myofascial meridians
- Incorporate imagery relevant to Timorese landscape and culture
- End with a moment of reflection on how this integrated view applies to their future practice

## 3. Concept Web

- As a class, create a mind map on the whiteboard
- Central theme: "Anatomy Trains in Timor-Leste"
- Students add concepts, connections, and cultural considerations learned in the lesson
- Discuss how this integrated approach can benefit their community
