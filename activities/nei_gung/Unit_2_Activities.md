# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Breath Wave
- Students stand in a circle
- One person starts by raising their arms while inhaling
- The next person follows, creating a "wave" of breath around the circle
- Repeat 3 times, then reverse direction

## 2. Body Scan Relaxation
- Students lie down on yoga mats
- Guide them through a progressive relaxation, focusing on each body part
- Emphasize releasing tension with each exhale

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Diaphragmatic Breathing Demonstration
- Use a balloon to demonstrate diaphragm movement
- Students place hands on their abdomen and chest to feel the difference
- Practice diaphragmatic breathing in pairs, observing each other's movements

## 2. Qi Visualization
- Students sit comfortably with eyes closed
- Guide them to imagine a warm, golden light in their lower abdomen
- Instruct them to visualize this light expanding and contracting with their breath

## 3. Dantian Locator
- Using diagrams, show the approximate location of the lower Dantian
- Students use their fingers to find the point about 3 finger-widths below their navel
- Practice focusing attention on this area while breathing naturally

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Breath Description Challenge
- In pairs, students take turns describing their partner's breathing pattern
- Encourage use of newly learned vocabulary (e.g., diaphragm, Dantian)
- Switch roles after 2 minutes

## 2. Qi Sensing Exercise
- In groups of 3-4, students take turns being the "sender" and "receivers"
- The sender focuses on directing Qi to their palms
- Receivers place their palms near the sender's and try to sense any warmth or tingling

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Breath Counting Meditation
- Students sit comfortably and count their breaths from 1 to 10
- If they lose count, they start over from 1
- Practice for 5 minutes

## 2. Dantian Breathing
- Students place one hand on their lower Dantian
- Inhale, imagining breath flowing into the Dantian
- Exhale, imagining the Dantian expanding slightly
- Practice for 5 minutes

## 3. Walking Breath Awareness
- Students walk slowly around the room
- Synchronize their steps with their breath (e.g., 2 steps per inhale, 2 per exhale)
- Maintain awareness of the Dantian while walking

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Energy Circle
- Students stand in a circle, holding hands
- Guide them to imagine energy flowing clockwise through the group
- After a minute, reverse the direction
- End by having everyone take a deep breath together

## 2. Reflection Journaling
- Students spend 5 minutes writing about their experience in the lesson
- Prompt them to note any new sensations or insights they had

## 3. Gratitude Breath
- Students stand or sit comfortably
- Guide them to take 3 deep breaths, thinking of something they're grateful for with each inhale
- On the exhale, they silently send out wishes for well-being to others
