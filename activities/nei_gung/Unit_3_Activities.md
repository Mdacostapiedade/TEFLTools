# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Spinal Wave
- Students stand in a circle
- Guide them to gently roll down vertebra by vertebra
- Slowly roll back up, imagining energy flowing up the spine
- Repeat 3 times, encouraging fluid movement

## 2. Energy Ball Visualization
- Students stand with hands held as if holding a ball
- Guide them to feel the energy between their palms
- Instruct them to slowly expand and contract the "ball"
- Encourage awareness of sensations in hands and arms

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Intention Directing Exercise
- Students stand in Wuji posture
- Guide them to focus intention on different body parts
- Instruct them to notice any sensations or warmth
- Progress from hands to feet, then internal organs

## 2. Microcosmic Orbit Walkthrough
- Use a large floor diagram of the orbit
- Students physically walk the pathway
- At each key point, pause and describe its significance
- Encourage students to sense energy at each location

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Orbit Mapping
- In groups of 3-4, students create a human microcosmic orbit
- Each student represents a key point on the orbit
- Groups present their "living orbit" to the class
- Other students guess which point each person represents

## 2. Qi Flow Choreography
- In pairs, students create a simple movement sequence
- Movements should represent Qi flowing through the orbit
- Pairs perform their sequence for another pair
- Observers give feedback on how well it represents the concept

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Personal Orbit Exploration
- Students lie down on yoga mats
- Guide them through a full body scan along the orbit pathway
- Instruct them to note any areas of tension or ease
- Encourage use of intention to direct energy to blocked areas

## 2. Journaling Qi Sensations
- Provide 10 minutes for silent meditation on the orbit
- Students then write or draw their experiences
- Prompt them to describe any physical sensations, emotions, or images

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Qi Ball Pass
- Form a circle and imagine passing a ball of energy
- Each student adds their own intention to the "ball" before passing
- Discuss how the energy felt as it moved around the circle

## 2. Gratitude Pulse
- Students stand in a circle, holding hands
- Guide them to send a pulse of gratitude through their hands
- The pulse travels around the circle, growing stronger
- End with a moment of silence, feeling connected to the group
