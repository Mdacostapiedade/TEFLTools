# Warm-up Activities

## Mind-Body Connection

1. Have students stand up and perform a series of simple physical movements (e.g., touching toes, arm circles).
2. Ask them to pay attention to how their brain is controlling these movements.
3. Discuss how the mind and body are connected through the nervous system.

## Consciousness Continuum

1. Draw a line on the board representing a consciousness continuum from "unconscious" to "fully conscious."
2. Have students place sticky notes with different states (e.g., sleeping, daydreaming, alert) along the continuum.
3. Discuss the varying levels of consciousness and how they relate to brain activity.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Neuron Building

1. Provide students with craft materials (pipe cleaners, pom-poms, etc.).
2. Instruct them to create a model of a neuron, labeling key parts.
3. Have students demonstrate how their neuron would transmit a signal.

## Consciousness Theories Gallery Walk

1. Create posters around the room, each describing a different theory of consciousness.
2. Have students rotate through the gallery, adding comments or questions to each poster.
3. Discuss the various theories as a class, encouraging critical thinking.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Free Will Debate Preparation

1. Divide the class into groups, assigning each group to argue for or against the existence of free will.
2. Provide time for groups to research and prepare their arguments.
3. Conduct a structured debate, with each side presenting their case.

## Cultural Mind Mapping

1. In pairs, have students create a Venn diagram comparing traditional Timorese beliefs about the mind with modern neuroscientific understanding.
2. Encourage them to find areas of overlap and divergence.
3. Share findings with the class, discussing the cultural implications of these differences.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Brain Structure Crossword

1. Create a crossword puzzle using key brain structures and functions as clues.
2. Have students complete the puzzle individually, referring to their notes if needed.
3. Review the answers as a class, clarifying any misunderstandings.

## Neurotransmitter Matching Game

1. Provide a list of neurotransmitters and their effects.
2. Have students match each neurotransmitter to its primary function in the brain.
3. Discuss the importance of balanced neurotransmitter activity for mental health.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Mind-Body Meditation

1. Guide students through a brief mindfulness meditation.
2. Ask them to focus on different parts of their body and observe the sensations.
3. Discuss how this exercise relates to the concepts of consciousness and mind-body connection.

## One-Minute Paper

1. In the last minute of class, have students write down:
   - One thing they learned today
   - One question they still have
2. Collect the papers to inform future lessons and address any lingering questions.
