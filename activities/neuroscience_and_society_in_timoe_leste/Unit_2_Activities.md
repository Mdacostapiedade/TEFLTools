# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Mirror Drawing Challenge
- Students pair up and sit back-to-back
- One student describes a simple object, the other draws it without looking
- Switch roles and repeat
- Discuss how this relates to hemispheric specialization

## 2. Word Association Speed Round
- Students form a circle
- Teacher provides a starting word
- Students quickly say the first word that comes to mind
- After a few rounds, discuss which words might be more "left-brain" or "right-brain" oriented

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Hemispheric Function Sorting Game
- Provide cards with various cognitive functions or skills
- Students work in small groups to sort these into "left hemisphere," "right hemisphere," or "both" categories
- Discuss results as a class, correcting misconceptions

## 2. Language Lateralization Experiment
- Conduct a simple dichotic listening test using headphones and pre-recorded stimuli
- Students record which ear (left or right) they hear certain words more clearly
- Discuss results and implications for language lateralization

## 3. Spatial Reasoning Puzzle Challenge
- Provide students with tangram puzzles or 3D manipulation tasks
- Time students as they complete the puzzles
- Discuss how spatial reasoning relates to right hemisphere function

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Timorese Art Analysis
- In pairs, students examine examples of Timorese art (paintings, textiles, sculptures)
- They discuss and note potential connections to hemispheric specialization
- Groups share their findings with the class

## 2. Brain Lateralization Debate
- Divide the class into two groups
- One group argues for the benefits of strong lateralization, the other for more balanced hemispheric function
- Hold a structured debate, encouraging students to use evidence from the lesson

## 3. Cultural Expression Mind Mapping
- In small groups, create a large mind map on poster paper
- Center the map on "Brain Lateralization and Timorese Culture"
- Branch out to explore potential influences on art, music, storytelling, and social norms

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Hemispheric Self-Assessment
- Students complete a questionnaire about their own cognitive tendencies and preferences
- They plot their results on a left-right brain continuum
- Reflect on how this might influence their learning styles and daily life

## 2. Creative Writing: A Tale of Two Hemispheres
- Students write a short story or poem from the perspective of either the left or right hemisphere
- Encourage them to incorporate functions and characteristics of their chosen hemisphere

## 3. Lateralization Diagram
- Students create a detailed diagram of the brain, labeling key areas related to lateralization
- Include brief descriptions of each area's function

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the prompt: "How might understanding brain lateralization change the way you approach learning or problem-solving?"

## 2. Hemispheric Charades
- Students act out various skills or activities without speaking
- Class guesses the activity and which hemisphere might be more dominant in that task

## 3. Reflection Circle
- Form a circle and pass around a "talking object"
- Each student shares one surprising thing they learned about brain lateralization
- Encourage connections to Timorese culture or personal experiences
