# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Rapid-Fire Decision Making

- Present students with a series of "Would you rather?" questions, asking them to make quick decisions and raise their hands for their choices.
- Examples:
  * Would you rather have the ability to fly or read minds?
  * Would you rather speak all languages or play all musical instruments?
  * Would you rather live in the ocean or on the moon?
- After the game, briefly discuss how they made these decisions and what factors influenced them.

## 2. Emotion vs. Logic Scenarios

- Present short scenarios where emotions might conflict with logical decision-making.
- Ask students to quickly decide what they would do and explain their reasoning.
- Examples:
  * You find a wallet with a large sum of money. Do you keep it or try to return it?
  * You're offered your dream job, but it requires moving far from your family. Do you take it?

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Neural Pathway Mapping

- Provide students with large sheets of paper and colored markers.
- Ask them to create a visual representation of the decision-making process in the brain, including the reward pathway, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala.
- Students should use arrows to show how information flows between different brain regions.

## 2. Cultural Neuroscience Case Studies

- Present brief case studies of decision-making scenarios from different cultures.
- Ask students to analyze how cultural factors might influence the neural processes involved.
- Examples could include:
  * Gift-giving customs in Japan
  * Collective decision-making in indigenous communities
  * Risk-taking behaviors in different societies

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Decision-Making Role Play

- Divide students into small groups and provide each with a decision-making scenario card.
- Groups should act out the scenario, emphasizing the emotional, cultural, and logical factors influencing the decision.
- After each performance, the class discusses the neuroscience concepts observed.

## 2. Cultural Influence Debate

- Assign pairs of students opposing viewpoints on the question: "Do cultural influences or biological factors have a greater impact on decision-making?"
- Give time for research and preparation, then conduct a structured debate.
- The class votes on the most convincing arguments.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Neural Mechanism Identification

- Provide students with a worksheet containing various real-life decisions.
- Ask them to identify and explain the potential neural mechanisms involved in each decision.
- Examples:
  * Choosing a university major
  * Deciding to try a new food
  * Selecting a life partner

## 2. Personal Decision Journal

- Students keep a journal for a day, noting significant decisions they make.
- For each decision, they should reflect on:
  * The emotions involved
  * Cultural factors that might have influenced them
  * The potential neural pathways activated

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Neuroscience Concept Map

- As a class, create a large concept map on the whiteboard, connecting all the key terms and ideas discussed in the lesson.
- Students take turns adding to the map and explaining connections.

## 2. Decision-Making in Timor-Leste Reflection

- Students write a brief reflection on how understanding the neuroscience of decision-making could be applied to improve decision-making processes in Timorese society.
- Volunteers share their ideas with the class.

## 3. Neuroscience Quiz Game

- Divide the class into teams.
- Ask rapid-fire questions about the neuroscience concepts covered in the lesson.
- The team with the most correct answers wins.
