# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Memory Challenge

- Display 10 traditional Timorese objects or images for 30 seconds
- Remove objects/images and have students write down as many as they can remember
- Discuss strategies used to remember items

## 2. Brain Teaser

- Present a short riddle or puzzle related to memory or learning
- Have students work in pairs to solve it
- Discuss how their brains processed the information to find the solution

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Types of Memory Stations

- Set up three stations representing short-term, long-term, and procedural memory
- At each station, provide examples and brief activities demonstrating that type of memory
- Students rotate through stations, taking notes on each memory type

## 2. Neuroplasticity Demonstration

- Use a simple task (e.g., writing with non-dominant hand) to demonstrate neuroplasticity
- Students practice the task for a few minutes each day over a week
- Track improvement and discuss how the brain changes with practice

## 3. Cultural Transmission Role-Play

- Assign roles: elder, apprentice, and observer
- Elder "teaches" a traditional Timorese skill or story
- Apprentice learns and demonstrates understanding
- Observer notes teaching methods and learning strategies used

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Memory Technique Comparison

- In pairs, research and compare a Western memory technique (e.g., method of loci) with a traditional Timorese memory practice
- Create a poster highlighting similarities, differences, and effectiveness

## 2. Design a Cultural Learning Activity

- In small groups, design a learning activity that incorporates:
  * A specific type of memory
  * Principles of neuroplasticity
  * Elements of Timorese culture
- Present the activity to the class

## 3. Debate: Traditional vs. Modern Learning

- Divide class into two groups: one supporting traditional Timorese learning methods, the other modern educational practices
- Debate the merits of each approach, using neuroscience concepts to support arguments

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Memory Journal

- Students keep a daily journal for a week, noting instances of using different types of memory
- Reflect on how understanding memory types could improve learning strategies

## 2. Neuroplasticity Challenge

- Choose a new skill to learn (e.g., juggling, origami)
- Practice for 15 minutes daily for two weeks
- Document progress and reflect on the experience of brain plasticity

## 3. Cultural Memory Map

- Create a mind map of important cultural memories in Timorese society
- Categorize each memory by type (short-term, long-term, procedural)
- Explain how these memories contribute to cultural identity

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Neuroscience News

- Share a recent neuroscience discovery related to memory or learning
- Discuss potential implications for education in Timor-Leste

## 2. Reflection Circle

- Form a circle and pass around a traditional Timorese object
- Each student shares one key concept they learned and how it relates to their life or Timorese culture

## 3. Memory Consolidation Quiz

- Quick, low-stakes quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Students grade their own quizzes and identify areas for review
