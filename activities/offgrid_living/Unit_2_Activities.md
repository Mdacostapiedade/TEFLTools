# Warm-up Activities

## Energy Use Charades
- Students act out different ways they use energy in daily life
- Others guess the activity and discuss if it could be powered by renewable sources

## Renewable Energy Pictionary
- Students draw renewable energy sources or components
- Class guesses while learning key vocabulary

# Main Lesson Activities

## Solar System Assembly Race
- Divide class into teams
- Each team receives a disassembled solar power kit
- Race to correctly assemble the system using provided diagrams

## Renewable Energy Jeopardy
- Create a Jeopardy-style game with categories like "Solar Power," "Micro-hydro," "Biomass," and "Energy Conservation"
- Students answer questions to earn points and reinforce knowledge

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Micro-hydro Site Assessment
- In pairs, students use topographic maps of Timor-Leste
- Identify potential micro-hydro sites based on terrain and water sources
- Present findings to the class

## Solar Panel Angle Optimization
- Groups use a solar panel, light source, and multimeter
- Experiment with different angles to find optimal positioning
- Record and graph results, then present to class

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Home Energy Audit Simulation
- Provide students with a fictional home layout and appliance list
- Students conduct a virtual energy audit, identifying energy-saving opportunities
- Calculate potential energy savings

## Solar System Sizing Challenge
- Give students different scenarios (e.g., powering a small home, a school)
- Students calculate required system size based on energy needs
- Design a basic solar power system on paper

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Renewable Energy Myth Busters
- Present common myths about renewable energy
- Students discuss in small groups and debunk myths using learned information
- Share findings with the class

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
- Collect papers to assess understanding and address remaining questions in the next lesson
