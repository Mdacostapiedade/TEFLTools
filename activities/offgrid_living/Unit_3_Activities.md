- First to complete a line wins

## Seasonal Water Availability Timeline
- In pairs, create a visual timeline showing water availability throughout the year
- Mark dry and wet seasons, festivals, and agricultural activities
- Share and discuss differences between regions

# Main Lesson Activities

## Rainwater Harvesting Model
- In small groups, build a miniature rainwater harvesting system using cardboard, straws, and cups
- Simulate rain and observe water collection
- Discuss potential improvements and real-world applications

## Water Filtration Race
- Set up different natural filtration materials (sand, gravel, charcoal) in clear containers
- Pour muddy water through each and time how long it takes to filter
- Compare water clarity and discuss the effectiveness of each material

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Community Water Audit

- Create a poster explaining the design and its benefits
- Present to the class in a "science fair" style setup

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Rainwater Harvesting Calculation Worksheet

- Calculate potential water collection for different buildings and seasons
- Compare results and discuss implications for water security

## Water Conservation Checklist
- Create a personal water conservation checklist for daily activities
- Identify current habits and areas for improvement
- Set realistic goals for reducing water consumption

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Water Wisdom Gallery Walk
- Students create quick posters with key takeaways from the lesson
- Hang posters around the room and conduct a silent gallery walk
- Use sticky notes to add comments or questions to peers' posters

## One Drop at a Time
- In a circle, pass around a small container of water
