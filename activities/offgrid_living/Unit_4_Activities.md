# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Crop and Tool Matching Game
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a set of cards featuring local crops and traditional farming tools
- Have groups race to match crops with the tools used to cultivate them
- Discuss the matches as a class, highlighting traditional farming practices

## 2. Permaculture Principles Charades
- Write permaculture principles on slips of paper
- Have students take turns acting out a principle without speaking
- Other students guess the principle being demonstrated
- Briefly discuss how each principle applies to Timorese agriculture

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Permaculture Design Challenge
- Divide the class into teams
- Provide each team with a scenario (e.g., sloped land, limited water access)
- Teams design a permaculture plot addressing the scenario's challenges
- Present designs to the class, explaining their choices

## 2. Soil Fertility Investigation
- Set up stations with different soil samples and testing materials
- Students rotate through stations, testing soil pH, texture, and organic matter content
- Groups discuss how to improve soil fertility based on their findings
- Share results and improvement strategies with the class

## 3. Traditional vs. Permaculture Farming Debate
- Divide the class into two groups: traditional farming advocates and permaculture supporters
- Each group prepares arguments for their assigned approach
- Conduct a structured debate on the merits of each system
- Conclude by discussing how to integrate the best aspects of both approaches

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Companion Planting Puzzle
- Provide pairs with a list of local crops and their companion planting relationships
- Have pairs create a planting layout that maximizes beneficial relationships
- Groups share their layouts and explain their reasoning

## 2. Natural Pest Control Recipe Development
- Assign each group a common local pest
- Groups research and develop a natural pest control solution using local ingredients
- Create a recipe card for their solution to share with the class

## 3. Agroforestry Design Workshop
- In small groups, design an agroforestry system for a given plot size
- Include a mix of timber trees, fruit trees, and annual crops
- Present designs to the class, explaining the benefits of their chosen combinations

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Seed Saving Journal
- Provide students with a template for a seed saving journal
- Students research and document saving methods for 5 local crop varieties
- Include information on storage, viability, and planting schedules

## 2. Personal Permaculture Plot Design
- Students design a small permaculture plot for their home or a community space
- Incorporate at least 3 permaculture principles in the design
- Write a brief explanation of how the design promotes sustainability

## 3. Composting Action Plan
- Students create a step-by-step plan for starting and maintaining a compost system
- Include lists of suitable local materials, maintenance schedule, and troubleshooting tips
- Develop a one-page guide that could be shared with community members

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Permaculture Principles Gallery Walk
- Students create posters illustrating permaculture principles applied in Timor-Leste
- Hang posters around the room
- Conduct a silent gallery walk where students view and reflect on each poster
- Conclude with a brief discussion of the most impactful or interesting applications

## 2. Sustainable Agriculture Commitment Circle
- Form a circle with the entire class
- Each student shares one sustainable agriculture practice they commit to trying
- Discuss how individual actions can contribute to community-wide sustainability

## 3. Reflection Mind Map
- Provide students with large sheets of paper and colored markers
- Students create mind maps connecting the concepts learned in the lesson
- Add branches for how these concepts relate to their lives and communities
- Share and discuss mind maps in small groups
