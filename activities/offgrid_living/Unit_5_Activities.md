# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Sustainable Building Bingo

- Create bingo cards with various sustainable building features and materials
- Show images of different buildings, and students mark off features they spot
- First to get a line or full house wins

## 2. Material Mystery Box

- Pass around boxes with hidden sustainable building materials inside
- Students feel the materials and guess what they are
- Discuss potential uses for each material in construction

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Sustainable Design Challenge

- Divide class into teams
- Each team receives a "plot of land" with specific environmental challenges
- Teams design a sustainable home addressing these challenges using learned principles
- Present designs to the class, explaining choices

## 2. Passive Solar Simulation

- Use a simple model house and lamp to demonstrate passive solar principles
- Students experiment with different orientations, shading, and ventilation techniques
- Measure and record temperature changes inside the model

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Traditional Technique Research

- Assign pairs different traditional Timorese building techniques
- Pairs research and create a short presentation on their technique
- Present findings to the class, discussing sustainability aspects

## 2. Bamboo Joint Workshop

- In small groups, practice creating different bamboo joints
- Each group masters one type of joint and teaches it to others
- Combine joints to create a simple bamboo structure

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Sustainable Material Fact Sheets

- Students choose a sustainable building material (e.g., adobe, bamboo, reclaimed wood)
- Create an informative fact sheet about the material's properties, uses, and benefits
- Include sketches or diagrams to illustrate key points

## 2. Passive Cooling Design Sketch

- Students sketch a home design incorporating passive cooling techniques
- Label key features and explain how they contribute to cooling
- Calculate potential energy savings compared to mechanical cooling

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Sustainable Building Pictionary

- Create cards with sustainable building terms and concepts
- Students take turns drawing while others guess the term
- Discuss and reinforce correct concepts after each round

## 2. Reflection Journaling

- Students write a short reflection on what they learned
- Prompt: "How could you apply today's lessons to make your own home more sustainable?"
- Share key insights with a partner or small group

## 3. Sustainable Building Quiz Game

- Create a Kahoot or similar quiz game covering key concepts from the lesson
- Play as a class, discussing correct answers and clarifying any misunderstandings
