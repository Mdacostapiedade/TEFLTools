# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Water Scarcity Scenario Cards

- Distribute cards with different water scarcity scenarios in Timor-Leste.
- Students discuss in pairs how desalination might address each situation.
- Share ideas with the class, creating a mind map on the board.

## 2. Desalination Myth Busters

- Present common myths about desalination.
- Students vote on whether each statement is true or false.
- Reveal correct answers and briefly discuss misconceptions.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Site Selection Criteria Jigsaw

- Divide class into expert groups, each focusing on one site selection criterion.
- Groups research their criterion and create a poster.
- Regroup into mixed teams to share knowledge and complete a comprehensive site evaluation worksheet.

## 2. EIA Process Flowchart

- Provide students with scrambled steps of the Environmental Impact Assessment process.
- In small groups, students arrange steps in the correct order and create a flowchart.
- Groups present their flowcharts, discussing the importance of each step.

## 3. Economic Feasibility Analysis Simulation

- Use a simple online simulation tool to model the costs and benefits of a small-scale desalination plant.
- Students adjust variables like plant capacity, energy source, and water pricing to see how it affects economic viability.
- Discuss findings and implications for real-world projects in Timor-Leste.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Desalination Site Selection Challenge

- In groups of 3-4, students use provided maps and data to select the best location for a desalination plant in Timor-Leste.
- Groups create a brief presentation justifying their choice based on the criteria learned.
- Class votes on the most convincing proposal.

## 2. Environmental Impact Mitigation Strategies

- Pairs are assigned a specific environmental impact of desalination (e.g., brine disposal, energy use).
- They research and propose three mitigation strategies suitable for Timor-Leste.
- Pairs share their ideas in a gallery walk format.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Rapid Feasibility Assessment

- Provide students with a hypothetical desalination project proposal for a Timorese coastal village.
- Individually, students complete a worksheet assessing the project's feasibility across key dimensions (technical, environmental, economic, social).
- They write a brief recommendation based on their assessment.

## 2. Stakeholder Perspective Analysis

- Each student is assigned a stakeholder role (e.g., fisherman, tourist resort owner, local government official).
- They write a one-page perspective piece on a proposed desalination project from their stakeholder's point of view.
- Volunteer students share their perspectives, fostering class discussion on diverse viewpoints.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Project Planning Bingo

- Create bingo cards with key terms and concepts from the lesson.
- Read out definitions or examples, and students mark off the corresponding terms on their cards.
- First student to complete a line wins and explains the concepts in that line.

## 2. Reflection Journaling

- Students spend 5 minutes writing in their journals, reflecting on:
  * One new thing they learned about desalination project planning
  * One aspect they found challenging
  * One way they could apply this knowledge in Timor-Leste

## 3. Exit Ticket: 3-2-1

- Before leaving, students write down:
  * 3 key points they remember from the lesson
  * 2 questions they still have
  * 1 way this lesson changed their thinking about water solutions in Timor-Leste
