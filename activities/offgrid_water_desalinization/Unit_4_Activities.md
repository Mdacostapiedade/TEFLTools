# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Desalination Component Matching Game

- Prepare cards with names of RO system components and their functions
- Students work in pairs to match components to functions as quickly as possible
- Discuss correct answers as a class

## 2. Water Challenge Brainstorm

- In small groups, students list water challenges faced by coastal communities in Timor-Leste
- Groups share their ideas, creating a collective mind map on the whiteboard

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Interactive RO System Diagram

- Project a blank RO system diagram on the screen
- Students take turns coming to the front to label components and explain their functions
- Class provides feedback and corrections

## 2. Solar Power Sizing Demonstration

- Use an online calculator to demonstrate how to size solar panels and batteries for an RO system
- Show how changing variables (e.g., water production, sunlight hours) affects the system requirements

## 3. Local Materials Scavenger Hunt

- Provide a list of RO system components
- Students use their devices to research and find local alternatives or suppliers in Timor-Leste
- Share findings with the class

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. RO System Design Challenge

- Divide class into groups of 3-4 students
- Provide each group with a scenario for a coastal village in Timor-Leste
- Groups design a basic RO system, considering local constraints and resources
- Create a poster or digital presentation of their design

## 2. Solar Integration Puzzle

- Give each group a set of puzzle pieces representing solar system components (panels, batteries, inverters, etc.)
- Groups must arrange the pieces to create an integrated solar-powered RO system
- Discuss the rationale behind their arrangements

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Component Function Flashcards

- Students create digital flashcards for each RO system component and its function
- Use a platform like Quizlet for easy review and self-testing

## 2. Solar Sizing Calculations

- Provide students with different scenarios (water demand, location, etc.)
- Students individually calculate the required solar panel and battery capacity
- Check answers with an online calculator or spreadsheet

## 3. Design Sketch

- Each student sketches a basic RO system design for a hypothetical remote village
- Include labels and a brief explanation of design choices

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Design Gallery Walk

- Display group design posters or presentations around the room
- Students walk around, leaving constructive feedback on sticky notes
- Discuss common strengths and areas for improvement as a class

## 2. Rapid Fire Review

- Teacher calls out key terms or concepts
- Students write down definitions or explanations in 30 seconds or less
- Share and discuss answers

## 3. Reflection Journaling

- Students spend 5 minutes writing about:
  * One new thing they learned
  * One question they still have
  * How they might apply this knowledge in Timor-Leste
- Volunteers share their reflections with the class
