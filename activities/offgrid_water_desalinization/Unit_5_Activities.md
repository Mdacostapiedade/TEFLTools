# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Before and After Gallery Walk

- Display images of marine environments before and after brine disposal around the room.
- Students walk around, observing the images and jotting down their observations.
- In pairs, students discuss the potential impacts they've identified.

## 2. Word Cloud Creation

- Using an online tool, create a live word cloud with students' responses to the prompt: "What comes to mind when you think of desalination's impact on the environment?"
- Briefly discuss the most prominent words and their significance.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Brine Disposal Methods Jigsaw

- Divide students into expert groups, each assigned a different brine disposal method.
- Groups research their method and its environmental impacts.
- Regroup students into mixed teams to share their expertise.

## 2. Energy Efficiency Puzzle

- Provide students with puzzle pieces representing different energy efficiency measures in desalination plants.
- Students work to assemble the puzzle, discussing how each piece contributes to overall efficiency.

## 3. Stakeholder Role Play

- Assign students different stakeholder roles (e.g., environmentalist, plant operator, local resident).
- Conduct a mock town hall meeting about a proposed desalination project.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Brine Management Solutions for Timor-Leste

- In groups, students brainstorm and research potential brine management solutions specific to Timor-Leste's coastal environment.
- Groups create a poster presenting their top three solutions with pros and cons.

## 2. Energy Consumption Analysis

- Provide pairs with energy consumption charts from a desalination plant.
- Students analyze the data and suggest three improvements to reduce energy use.
- Pairs present their findings to another pair for peer feedback.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Environmental Impact Report Outline

- Students individually create an outline for an environmental impact report for a small-scale desalination project.
- Provide a template with key sections to guide their work.

## 2. Carbon Footprint Calculation

- Give students data on a desalination plant's operations.
- They calculate the plant's carbon footprint using an online calculator.
- Students write a short reflection on ways to reduce the footprint.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Concept Map Creation

- Students create a concept map linking the main topics covered in the lesson (environmental impacts, energy efficiency, community engagement).
- Share and discuss a few examples as a class.

## 2. Exit Ticket Quiz

- Administer a quick 5-question quiz on key concepts using a digital tool like Kahoot or Quizlet.
- Review answers as a class, addressing any misconceptions.

## 3. Reflection Journaling

- Students spend the last few minutes writing in a journal, reflecting on what they learned and how it might apply to Timor-Leste's water challenges.
- Invite a few volunteers to share their reflections.
