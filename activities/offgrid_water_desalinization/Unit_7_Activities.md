# Warm-up Activities

## Desalination Technology Bingo
- Create bingo cards with various desalination technologies and concepts
- Teacher calls out definitions, students mark off corresponding terms
- First to complete a line wins

## Climate Change Impact Brainstorm
- In pairs, students list potential impacts of climate change on water resources in Timor-Leste
- Share ideas with class and create a mind map on the whiteboard

# Main Lesson Activities

## Case Study Jigsaw
- Divide class into "expert groups," each assigned a different case study
- Students become experts on their case study, then form new groups to share knowledge
- Each new group completes a comparison chart of all case studies

## Technology Timeline
- Create a large timeline on classroom wall
- Students research and add emerging desalination technologies to the timeline
- Discuss potential future developments and their implications for Timor-Leste

# Group Work Tasks

## Desalination Plant Design Challenge
- In groups, design a small-scale desalination plant for a specific location in Timor-Leste
- Consider local conditions, energy sources, and environmental impacts
- Present designs to class using visual aids

## Climate Adaptation Strategy Roleplay
- Assign roles: government officials, environmental scientists, community leaders, etc.
- Groups develop a climate change adaptation strategy incorporating desalination
- Hold a mock town hall meeting to present and debate strategies

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Technology Assessment Matrix
- Create a matrix to evaluate emerging desalination technologies
- Criteria: efficiency, cost, environmental impact, scalability, etc.
- Students research and complete the matrix, then write a summary of findings

## Virtual Lab: Forward Osmosis Simulation
- Use online simulation tools to explore forward osmosis process
- Students manipulate variables and observe outcomes
- Write a brief report on potential applications in Timor-Leste

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 3-2-1 Reflection
- Students write:
  * 3 things they learned
  * 2 questions they still have
  * 1 way they can apply this knowledge to help Timor-Leste

## Future Headlines
- In pairs, students create newspaper headlines about desalination in Timor-Leste 10 years from now
- Share headlines and discuss potential pathways to achieve positive outcomes

## Concept Map Challenge
- In small groups, create a concept map linking key terms from the lesson
- Groups exchange maps and add connections or missing concepts
