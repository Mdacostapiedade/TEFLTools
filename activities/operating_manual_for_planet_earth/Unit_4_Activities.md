# Warm-up Activities

## Earth from Space
- Show a short video clip of Earth from space
- Students write down three things that make Earth unique as a "spaceship"
- Discuss responses as a class

## Environmental Cycle Charades
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group acts out a part of the carbon, water, or nutrient cycle
- Other groups guess which part of which cycle is being portrayed

# Main Lesson Activities

## Global Cycles Jigsaw
- Divide class into three groups: carbon cycle, water cycle, nutrient cycle
- Each group becomes "experts" on their assigned cycle
- Regroup students to share knowledge with members from other cycles

## Ecosystem Services Scavenger Hunt
- Create stations around the classroom with information about different ecosystem services
- Students rotate through stations, collecting information on a worksheet
- Discuss findings as a class, focusing on Timor-Leste's ecosystems

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Ecosystem Detectives
- In pairs, students research one of Timor-Leste's critical ecosystems
- Create a poster highlighting biodiversity, ecosystem services, and threats
- Present findings to the class

## Cycle Connection Challenge
- In small groups, students create a diagram showing how the carbon, water, and nutrient cycles interconnect
- Groups present their diagrams, explaining the connections they've identified

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Ecosystem Services Matching Game
- Provide a list of ecosystem services and ecosystem types
- Students match services to the appropriate ecosystems
- Include examples specific to Timor-Leste

## Cycle Diagram Completion
- Give students partially completed diagrams of environmental cycles
- Students fill in missing components and label processes

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Biomimicry Brainstorm
- Introduce the concept of biomimicry with a brief explanation and examples
- Students brainstorm how nature's designs could inspire solutions to local environmental challenges
- Share ideas with the class

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the question: "How are you part of Spaceship Earth's life support system?"
- Volunteers share their responses
- Discuss how individual actions connect to global systems
