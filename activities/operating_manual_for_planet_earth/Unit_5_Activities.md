# Warm-up Activities

## System Scavenger Hunt
- Divide students into pairs
- Give each pair 5 minutes to find and photograph as many examples of systems as they can around the classroom or school grounds
- Share findings with the class, explaining why each example is a system

## Mind Map Madness
- Students create a mind map on the board, starting with "Systems in Timor-Leste"
- Each student adds one branch to the mind map, connecting different systems they observe in their daily lives

# Main Lesson Activities

## Systems Theory Timeline
- Create a large timeline on the wall
- Students research key figures and events in the development of General Systems Theory
- Add cards with information to the timeline and discuss the evolution of systems thinking

## System Component Sorting
- Provide cards with various elements, interconnections, and purposes
- Students work in groups to sort these into coherent systems
- Groups present their systems to the class, explaining their choices

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Feedback Loop Role Play
- Assign roles to students (e.g., farmer, soil, crops, market)
- Students act out positive and negative feedback loops in a Timorese agricultural system
- Discuss how changes in one part of the system affect the others

## Timor-Leste Systems Jigsaw
- Divide class into expert groups (e.g., education, healthcare, agriculture, energy)
- Each group researches their system in Timor-Leste
- Regroup with members from each expert group to share findings and create a comprehensive systems map

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Ecosystem Mapping
- Students create a map of their personal "ecosystem" (family, school, hobbies, etc.)
- Identify elements, interconnections, and feedback loops in their lives
- Reflect on how changes in one area might affect others

## Systems Thinking Journal
- Provide prompts for daily reflection on systems observed
- Students write short entries identifying systems, their components, and potential interventions
- Share insights periodically in class discussions

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Systems Thinking Elevator Pitch
- Students have 60 seconds to explain a key concept from systems thinking to a partner
- Partners provide feedback and switch roles
- Volunteer to share the most compelling explanations with the class

## Future Systems Visioning
- Students close their eyes and imagine Timor-Leste 50 years in the future
- Write or draw their vision of how various systems have evolved
- Share visions and discuss how systems thinking could help achieve positive futures
