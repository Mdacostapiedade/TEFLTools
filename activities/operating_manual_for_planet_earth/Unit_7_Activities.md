# Warm-up Activities

## Landscape Comparison
1. Display contrasting images of degraded and thriving landscapes in Timor-Leste.
2. Students discuss in pairs:
   - What differences do you notice between these landscapes?
   - What factors might have caused these differences?
3. Share observations as a class.

## Word Association Web
1. Write "Regenerative Design" in the center of the whiteboard.
2. Students take turns adding related words or concepts, connecting them with lines.
3. Discuss the connections and introduce key vocabulary.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Regenerative Design Principles Jigsaw
1. Divide class into expert groups, each assigned a principle of regenerative design.
2. Expert groups research their principle and create a short presentation.
3. Regroup students into mixed groups to share their expertise.
4. Each mixed group creates a mind map summarizing all principles.

## Timor-Leste Land Use Challenge Analysis
1. Present a series of land use challenges in Timor-Leste (e.g., deforestation, soil erosion).
2. For each challenge, students:
   - Identify potential causes
   - Suggest regenerative solutions
   - Predict long-term impacts of implementing these solutions
3. Discuss findings as a class.

# Group Work Tasks

## Regenerative Solution Pitch
1. Divide class into small groups.
2. Assign each group a specific land use challenge in Timor-Leste.
3. Groups research and brainstorm regenerative solutions.
4. Create a poster or digital presentation summarizing their findings.
5. Present a 2-minute pitch to the class.

## Sustainable Community Design
1. In groups, students design a small-scale regenerative community for a specific region in Timor-Leste.
2. Include elements such as:
   - Housing
   - Food production
   - Water management
   - Energy systems
   - Waste management
3. Create a visual representation of the community design.
4. Present designs to the class for feedback.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Regenerative Practice Identification
1. Provide students with a list of various agricultural and land use practices.
2. Students categorize each practice as regenerative or non-regenerative.
3. For non-regenerative practices, suggest a regenerative alternative.

## Personal Eco-Audit
1. Students conduct a personal eco-audit of their daily activities.
2. Identify areas where they can apply regenerative principles.
3. Create a one-week action plan to implement regenerative practices in their lives.

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## Regenerative Design Gallery Walk
1. Display group projects and individual work around the classroom.
2. Students circulate, viewing others' work and leaving constructive feedback on sticky notes.
3. Discuss common themes and innovative ideas as a class.

## Vision Board Sharing
1. In pairs, students share their homework vision boards for a sustainable Timor-Leste in 2050.
2. Partners provide feedback and suggestions.
3. Volunteer pairs present their combined vision to the class.

## Regenerative Practices Commitment
1. Each student writes down one regenerative practice they commit to implementing in their daily life.
2. Share commitments with the class.
3. Create a class "Regenerative Practices Pledge" poster to display in the classroom.
