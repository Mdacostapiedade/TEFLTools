# Warm-up Activities

## Climate Experience Sharing
- Students form small groups and share their personal experiences with staying cool in Timor Leste.
- Each group creates a mind map of cooling strategies on large paper.
- Groups present their mind maps, discussing which strategies are passive cooling techniques.

## Temperature Guessing Game
- Display photos of different Timorese locations (coastal, mountainous, urban, rural).
- Students guess the average temperature for each location.
- Reveal actual temperatures and discuss factors influencing local climates.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Interactive Heat Transfer Demonstration
- Use simple props (e.g., ice cubes, metal spoons, fabric) to demonstrate conduction, convection, and radiation.
- Students predict and observe how heat moves in each scenario.

## Climate Data Interpretation
- Provide climate data sets for different regions of Timor Leste.
- Students create graphs of temperature and humidity patterns.
- Discuss how these patterns might influence building design in each region.

## Virtual Tour of Traditional Timorese Architecture
- Show a video or photo slideshow of traditional Timorese buildings.
- Students identify and list passive cooling features they observe.
- Discuss how these features respond to local climate conditions.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Passive Cooling Strategy Matching
- Create cards with passive cooling strategies and climate challenges.
- In pairs, students match strategies to appropriate climate challenges.
- Groups compare and justify their matches.

## Microclimate Analysis Project
- Assign each group a different microclimate in Timor Leste (coastal, mountain, urban, etc.).
- Groups research and present key climate characteristics and suitable passive cooling strategies for their assigned microclimate.

## Traditional vs. Modern Building Comparison
- Provide images of traditional and modern Timorese buildings.
- Groups compare and contrast the passive cooling features in each.
- Present findings and discuss the effectiveness of each approach.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Passive Cooling Feature Sketch
- Students individually sketch and label a building incorporating at least three passive cooling features suitable for Timor Leste's climate.

## Climate Data Analysis Worksheet
- Provide a worksheet with climate data and questions about implications for building design.
- Students complete the worksheet, interpreting data and suggesting appropriate cooling strategies.

## Vocabulary Application
- Give students a list of key vocabulary terms from the lesson.
- Students write a short paragraph using at least five of the terms correctly in context.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Passive Cooling Quiz Show
- Divide the class into teams.
- Host a quick quiz game with questions covering the main concepts from the lesson.

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the prompt: "What is the most important thing you learned about passive cooling in Timor Leste today?"
- Share responses and address any misconceptions.

## Cooling Strategy Charades
- Students take turns acting out different passive cooling strategies.
- Class guesses the strategy and briefly explains how it works.
