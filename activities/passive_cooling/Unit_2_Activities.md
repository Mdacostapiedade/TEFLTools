# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Ventilation Scavenger Hunt (10 minutes)
- Students explore the classroom or nearby buildings to identify and photograph examples of natural ventilation features (e.g., windows, vents, chimneys).
- In pairs, they share their findings and discuss how each feature might contribute to air movement.

## 2. Personal Cooling Strategies (5 minutes)
- Students write down three ways they personally stay cool without air conditioning.
- Share responses with the class and create a word cloud of the most common strategies.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 3. Pressure Differential Demonstration (10 minutes)
- Use a simple box with two openings and a small fan to demonstrate how pressure differentials create airflow.
- Students predict and then observe how changing the size and location of openings affects the airflow.

## 4. Stack Effect Visualization (15 minutes)
- In small groups, students use a tall, clear plastic tube with openings at different heights.
- They place a smoke source at the bottom and observe how the smoke rises and exits through upper openings.
- Groups experiment with different opening configurations and discuss their observations.

# Group Work Tasks

## 5. Cross-Ventilation Design Challenge (30 minutes)
- In groups of 3-4, students design a small Timorese home optimized for cross-ventilation.
- Provide each group with a basic floor plan template, cut-out furniture pieces, and arrow stickers to indicate airflow.
- Groups present their designs, explaining their ventilation strategies.

## 6. Buoyancy-Driven Ventilation Model (25 minutes)
- Groups construct simple cardboard models to demonstrate stack ventilation.
- They use heat sources (e.g., small light bulbs) to create temperature differentials and visualize airflow with smoke pencils.
- Groups compare different chimney heights and opening sizes to optimize the stack effect.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 7. Ventilation Calculation Worksheet (15 minutes)
- Students complete a worksheet with problems on calculating air changes per hour (ACH) for different room sizes and opening configurations.
- They practice using formulas to determine required opening sizes for target ventilation rates.

## 8. Sketch and Annotate (20 minutes)
- Provide students with images of different building types (traditional and modern).
- They sketch over the images to indicate potential airflow patterns and annotate with suggestions for improving natural ventilation.

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 9. Ventilation Strategy Sorting Game (10 minutes)
- Create cards with various ventilation strategies and building features.
- Students work in pairs to sort the cards into categories: wind-driven ventilation, buoyancy-driven ventilation, or both.

## 10. One-Minute Paper (5 minutes)
- Students write a brief response to: "What's the most important thing you learned about natural ventilation today, and how might you apply it in Timor Leste?"
- Collect responses to inform future lessons and address any misconceptions.
