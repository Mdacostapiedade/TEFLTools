# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Temperature Guessing Game

- Students feel two containers of water (one room temperature, one cooler)
- They guess the temperature difference and explain their reasoning
- Introduce the concept of evaporative cooling as the reason for the temperature difference

## 2. Traditional Cooling Methods Brainstorm

- In small groups, students list traditional cooling methods used in Timor Leste
- Groups share their lists with the class
- Discuss how these methods might relate to evaporative cooling principles

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Evaporative Cooling Demonstration

- Instructor demonstrates a simple evaporative cooling setup (fan blowing over a wet cloth)
- Students observe and measure temperature changes
- Class discusses the principles behind the observed cooling effect

## 2. Interactive Presentation on Evaporative Cooling Technologies

- Instructor presents main content using slides and videos
- Students participate by answering questions and sharing observations throughout the presentation

## 3. Virtual Tour of Evaporative Cooling Systems

- Students take a virtual tour of various evaporative cooling systems using online resources
- They identify key components and principles in action

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Evaporative Cooler Construction Challenge

- In groups, students design and build simple evaporative coolers using provided materials
- They test their coolers and measure temperature reduction
- Groups present their designs and results to the class

## 2. Case Study Analysis

- Each group is assigned a case study of evaporative cooling in a climate similar to Timor Leste
- They analyze the system's effectiveness, challenges, and potential adaptations for local use
- Groups create posters to present their findings

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Wet-Bulb Temperature Calculations

- Students use psychrometric charts and local climate data to calculate wet-bulb temperatures for different regions in Timor Leste
- They interpret the results to assess evaporative cooling potential

## 2. Water Resource Assessment

- Each student selects a specific region in Timor Leste
- They research and analyze water availability data for that region
- Students write a brief report on the feasibility of implementing evaporative cooling systems in their chosen area

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Evaporative Cooling Quiz Game

- Students form teams to compete in a quiz game covering key concepts from the lesson
- Questions include multiple-choice, true/false, and short answer formats

## 2. Reflection and Application

- Students write a brief reflection on how they could apply evaporative cooling principles in their own homes or communities
- Volunteers share their ideas with the class

## 3. Concept Map Creation

- Individually or in pairs, students create concept maps linking the main ideas from the lesson
- They identify connections between evaporative cooling principles, technologies, and applications in Timor Leste
