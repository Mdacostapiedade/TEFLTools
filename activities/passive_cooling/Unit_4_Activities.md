# Warm-up Activities

## Solar Path Charades
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group acts out the sun's path across the sky for different seasons
- Other groups guess which season is being portrayed

## Material Mystery Box
- Pass around boxes with different building materials inside
- Students feel the materials without looking and guess their thermal properties
- Discuss how these properties might affect building cooling

# Main Lesson Activities

## Solar Geometry Visualization
- Use a physical model of the Earth and a bright lamp to demonstrate solar angles
- Students mark solar paths on a clear plastic hemisphere for different times of year

## Thermal Imaging Demonstration
- Use a thermal imaging camera to show heat patterns on different building materials
- Students predict and then observe which materials absorb or reflect more heat

## Cool Roof Experiment
- Set up small model roofs with different colors and materials under bright lamps
- Students measure and compare temperatures of each roof over time

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Shading Device Design Challenge
- In pairs, design and build a scale model of an effective shading device for a given building orientation
- Present and explain designs to the class

## Material Selection Debate
- Divide class into groups, each assigned a different building material
- Groups research and debate the pros and cons of their material for passive cooling

## Local Case Study Analysis
- In small groups, analyze photos of local buildings for passive cooling features
- Present findings and suggest improvements

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Solar Path Diagram Interpretation
- Provide students with solar path diagrams for Timor Leste
- Students answer questions about optimal building orientation and shading strategies

## Thermal Mass Calculation
- Give students data on different materials' thermal properties
- Have them calculate and compare the heat storage capacity of various wall assemblies

## Cool Roof Design
- Students sketch and annotate a cool roof design for a typical Timorese building
- Include material choices and explain their cooling effects

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Passive Cooling Bingo
- Create bingo cards with passive cooling strategies and concepts
- Call out definitions or examples, students mark off corresponding terms

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have

## Building Envelope Pictionary
- Quick-fire rounds where students draw passive cooling concepts
- Others guess the strategy or principle being illustrated

## Cooling Strategy Matching Game
- Provide cards with cooling problems and solution strategies
- Students race to match problems with appropriate passive cooling solutions
