# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Underground Temperature Guessing Game

- Students form pairs and guess the temperature at different depths underground (1m, 5m, 10m).
- Share and discuss guesses, then reveal actual average temperatures for Timor Leste.
- Discuss why temperatures stabilize at deeper levels.

## 2. Cool Spaces Memory Share

- Students share experiences of naturally cool spaces they've encountered (caves, cellars, etc.).
- Create a mind map on the board, categorizing common features of these cool spaces.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Soil Temperature Measurement

- In small groups, students use soil temperature probes to measure temperatures at various depths around the school grounds.
- Plot results on a graph and compare to the theoretical geothermal gradient.

## 2. Earth Cooling Techniques Jigsaw

- Divide class into expert groups, each researching one earth cooling technique (earth berming, earth-air heat exchangers, underground buildings).
- Regroup into mixed teams to share knowledge and create posters explaining each technique.

## 3. Virtual Earth-Cooled Building Tour

- Using online resources or virtual reality, take a guided tour of earth-cooled buildings around the world.
- Students note design features and how they might apply to Timor Leste's climate.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Earth Cooling Potential Mapping

- In small groups, analyze local soil maps, geological data, and climate information for Timor Leste.
- Create a map highlighting areas with high potential for earth cooling techniques.
- Present findings to the class, justifying choices.

## 2. Earth-Air Heat Exchanger Design Challenge

- In pairs, design a basic earth-air heat exchanger system for a small building in Timor Leste.
- Consider tube material, length, depth, and air flow rate.
- Create a simple diagram and present to another pair for feedback.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Soil Thermal Properties Worksheet

- Complete a worksheet matching soil types to their thermal properties (conductivity, heat capacity).
- Calculate potential temperature reductions for different soil scenarios.

## 2. Earth Berming Sketch

- Individually sketch a cross-section of an earth-bermed building suitable for Timor Leste's climate.
- Label key features and explain how they contribute to cooling.

## 3. Case Study Analysis

- Read a case study of an earth-cooled building in a similar climate to Timor Leste.
- Answer questions about design choices, challenges, and performance.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Earth Cooling Techniques Pros and Cons

- As a class, create a table listing pros and cons of different earth cooling techniques for Timor Leste.
- Discuss which might be most appropriate and why.

## 2. Concept Application Quiz

- Quick quiz using student response systems or hand signals to check understanding of key concepts.
- Discuss any misconceptions as a group.

## 3. Reflection Journal

- Students spend 5 minutes writing in a reflection journal, considering:
  - One new thing they learned about earth cooling
  - How they might apply this knowledge in their future work
  - Any questions they still have about the topic
