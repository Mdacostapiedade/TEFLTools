# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Climate Comparison Carousel

- Students form two concentric circles facing each other.
- Inner circle discusses passive cooling strategies, outer circle discusses mechanical cooling.
- Students rotate and share ideas, comparing advantages and disadvantages.
- After 3 rotations, class reconvenes to summarize findings.

## 2. Comfort Zone Mapping

- Students receive sticky notes and a large wall map of Timor Leste.
- They write comfort challenges for different regions and place them on the map.
- Class discusses how hybrid systems might address these challenges.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Hybrid System Component Jigsaw

- Students are divided into expert groups, each focusing on a component of hybrid cooling systems.
- Groups research their component and create a visual representation.
- Students regroup to teach others about their component.
- Class assembles a large diagram of a complete hybrid system.

## 2. Control Strategy Flowchart

- In pairs, students create a flowchart for a hybrid cooling system's control logic.
- They consider factors like outdoor temperature, occupancy, and time of day.
- Pairs exchange flowcharts and provide feedback.
- Class discusses optimal control strategies for Timor Leste's climate.

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Case Study Analysis Challenge

- Groups receive case studies of mixed-mode cooled buildings in tropical climates.
- They identify passive and mechanical strategies used and how they're integrated.
- Groups create a poster presentation highlighting key features and lessons learned.
- Class conducts a gallery walk to view and discuss all case studies.

## 2. Hybrid Cooling System Design Charrette

- Teams of 4-5 students design a mixed-mode cooling system for a public library in Dili.
- They use provided materials (sketch paper, climate data, component cards) to develop their design.
- Teams present their designs to the class, explaining their rationale and expected performance.
- Class votes on the most innovative and context-appropriate design.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Performance Optimization Simulation

- Students use energy modeling software to experiment with different control strategies for a hybrid cooling system.
- They adjust parameters like switchover temperature and ventilation rates.
- Students record energy use and comfort metrics for each scenario.
- They write a brief report on their findings and optimal strategy.

## 2. Adaptive Comfort Calculator

- Students develop a spreadsheet-based tool to calculate adaptive comfort ranges for Timor Leste.
- They input local climate data and use adaptive comfort equations.
- Students create graphs showing comfort zones throughout the year.
- They reflect on implications for hybrid cooling system design.

# Cool-down Activities

## 1. Hybrid Cooling Myth Busters

- Instructor presents common misconceptions about hybrid cooling systems.
- Students work in pairs to "bust" these myths using knowledge from the lesson.
- Pairs share their myth-busting explanations with the class.
- Class discusses any lingering questions or uncertainties.

## 2. Future Scenarios Brainstorm

- Students individually brainstorm how climate change might affect hybrid cooling in Timor Leste.
- They share ideas in small groups and categorize them (e.g., challenges, opportunities).
- Groups report top ideas to the class.
- Class discusses how to future-proof hybrid cooling designs.
