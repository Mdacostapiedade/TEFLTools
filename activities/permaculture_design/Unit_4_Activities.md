Here's a set of engaging activities for the Soil Preparation and Improvement lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Soil Preparation and Improvement Lesson

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Soil Texture Relay Race (15 minutes)
- Divide participants into teams.
- Set up stations with different soil types (sandy, clay, loamy).
- Teams race to feel and identify each soil type, writing their answers on a board.
- Discuss the characteristics of each soil type and their impact on gardening.

### 2. Compost Ingredient Scavenger Hunt (10 minutes)
- Give participants a list of compostable items found locally.
- Have them search the immediate area to find as many items as possible in 5 minutes.
- Discuss which items are "green" (nitrogen-rich) and which are "brown" (carbon-rich).

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Double-Digging Demonstration and Practice (30 minutes)
- Demonstrate the double-digging technique step-by-step.
- Have participants practice in small groups, taking turns with each step.
- Provide feedback and guidance as they work.

### 2. Compost Layer Cake (20 minutes)
- Using a clear container, demonstrate layering of compost materials.
- Explain the importance of each layer (green, brown, soil, water).
- Have participants create their own "mini compost" in clear cups to take home.

### 3. Soil Amendment Station Rotation (30 minutes)
- Set up stations for different soil amendments (biochar, wood ash, manure).
- Groups rotate through stations, learning about each amendment's benefits and application.
- At each station, participants mix the amendment with soil and observe changes.

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Compost Recipe Challenge (20 minutes)
- In pairs, create a "recipe" for the perfect compost pile using locally available materials.
- Present recipes to the group, explaining choices and rationale.

### 2. Soil Improvement Debate (15 minutes)
- Divide into groups representing different soil improvement methods.
- Each group argues why their method is most effective for Timor-Leste.
- Conclude with a discussion on integrating multiple methods.

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Soil Assessment Worksheet (10 minutes)
- Provide participants with soil samples and a worksheet.
- Individuals assess soil texture, color, and smell, recording observations.
- Use findings to recommend appropriate soil improvement techniques.

### 2. Double-Digging Diagram (15 minutes)
- Participants create a step-by-step diagram of the double-digging process.
- Include labels and brief explanations for each step.

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. Soil Improvement Pictionary (10 minutes)
- Create cards with soil improvement terms and techniques.
- Participants take turns drawing while others guess the term.

### 2. One-Minute Paper (5 minutes)
- Participants write for one minute on:
  * One new thing they learned
  * One question they still have
- Share responses with a partner or the group.

### 3. Commitment Circle (10 minutes)
- Form a circle and pass around a handful of soil.
- Each participant shares one soil improvement technique they commit to trying at home.

These activities are designed to reinforce key concepts from the Soil Preparation and Improvement lesson while keeping participants engaged through hands-on, interactive experiences.
