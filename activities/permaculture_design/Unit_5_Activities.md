# Engaging Activities for Planting Techniques and Crop Selection

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Crop Charades (10 minutes)
- Divide the class into small groups
- Each group receives cards with names of local crops
- One member acts out the crop without speaking while others guess

- Discuss the sketches as a class, clarifying any misconceptions

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Triangular Spacing Demonstration (15 minutes)
- Use a large open space (indoor or outdoor)
- Have students stand in a grid pattern, then rearrange into triangular spacing
- Discuss the differences in space utilization and plant interaction

### 2. Companion Planting Match Game (20 minutes)
- Create cards with crop names and their companion plants
- Students work in small groups to match crops with their ideal companions
- Discuss the reasons behind successful companion planting pairs

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Design a Permagarden Plot (30 minutes)

- Provide a template with dimensions and local crop options
- Groups must incorporate triangular spacing, companion planting, and crop rotation
- Present designs to the class and explain choices

### 2. Seasonal Planting Calendar Creation (25 minutes)
- In pairs, create a seasonal planting calendar for Timor-Leste
- Provide a template with months and common local crops

- Share calendars and discuss variations based on local microclimates

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Crop Rotation Planning (15 minutes)
- Give each student a worksheet with a 4-year garden plan template
- Provide a list of crop families and their nutritional needs
- Students create a 4-year crop rotation plan for a small garden plot
- Review plans individually or in small groups

### 2. Bio-intensive Planting Quiz (10 minutes)
- Provide a short quiz on bio-intensive planting methods
- Include multiple-choice and short answer questions
- Cover key concepts like triangular spacing, companion planting, and crop selection
- Review answers as a class

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. One-Minute Paper (5 minutes)
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
- Collect papers and address common questions or misconceptions

### 2. Planting Technique Pictionary (10 minutes)
- Divide the class into two teams
- One member from each team comes to the board
- They draw a planting technique or crop management strategy
- Teams compete to guess correctly
- Use this to reinforce key concepts from the lesson

These activities are designed to be interactive, engaging, and reinforce the key concepts of the lesson on planting techniques and crop selection. They incorporate various learning styles and encourage both individual and group participation.
