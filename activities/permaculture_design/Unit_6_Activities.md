- Prepare cards with various garden maintenance tasks
- Students take turns acting out the tasks without speaking
- Other students guess the task being performed
- Discuss the importance of each task after it's guessed correctly

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Pest Control Potion Brewing (30 minutes)

### Seed Saving Stations (30 minutes)
- Set up different stations for various seed saving techniques (dry processing, wet processing, fermentation)
- Rotate students through each station, allowing them to practice each technique
- Provide a variety of local seeds for students to work with
- Encourage students to take notes on each method for future reference

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Pest Identification and Management Plan (15 minutes)

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### Garden Maintenance Jeopardy (15 minutes)
- Create a Jeopardy-style game board with categories like "Pest Control," "Seed Saving," "Garden Tools," and "Maintenance Tasks"
- Divide the class into teams and play a quick round to review key concepts

### Reflection Circle (10 minutes)
- Form a circle with the entire class
- Pass around a "talking stick" or other object

- Encourage brief discussion on how these techniques can benefit their communities

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of the lesson while keeping students engaged through a variety of interactive and hands-on tasks. They also encourage both individual reflection and collaborative learning, which can help deepen understanding of the material.
