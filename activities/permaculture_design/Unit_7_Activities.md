- Groups share their top challenges with the class
- Instructor facilitates a brief discussion on common themes, setting the stage for the importance of effective community engagement

### Cultural Sensitivity Icebreaker (10 minutes)
- Students pair up with someone they don't know well
- Each pair has 2 minutes to learn about a unique cultural practice or tradition from their partner's community
- Pairs then introduce their partner's cultural practice to the class
- Discuss how understanding local customs can improve community engagement

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Stakeholder Mapping Exercise (20 minutes)
- In small groups, students create a stakeholder map for a hypothetical permagarden project in a Timorese village
- Groups identify key stakeholders, their interests, and potential roles in the project
- Each group presents their map, explaining their reasoning
- Class discusses the importance of involving various stakeholders in community projects

### Participatory Learning Technique Carousel (30 minutes)
- Set up stations around the room, each featuring a different participatory learning technique (e.g., focus groups, community mapping, photovoice)
- Groups rotate through stations, spending 5 minutes at each to learn about and discuss the technique
- After rotating, groups choose one technique and plan a brief demonstration of how they would use it in a permagarden project

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Role-play Scenarios (30 minutes)
- Divide class into pairs
- Distribute role-play scenario cards (e.g., convincing a skeptical farmer, addressing concerns about new techniques, negotiating land use for a community garden)
- Pairs practice role-playing community engagement scenarios
- Debrief and discuss effective strategies observed

### Community Outreach Campaign Design (45 minutes)
- In groups of 4-5, students design a community outreach campaign for promoting permagardens
- Each group develops:

  * A basic timeline for implementation
- Groups present their campaigns to the class for feedback

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Adapting Techniques to Local Context (20 minutes)
- Each student chooses a specific permagarden technique (e.g., composting, water management)
- They write a short plan on how to adapt this technique to their local community's customs and preferences
- Students share their ideas in small groups, offering constructive feedback to each other

### Reflection Journal Entry (15 minutes)
- Students individually write a reflection on:
  * One key insight they gained about community engagement
  * How they plan to apply this insight in their work
  * Potential challenges they anticipate and how they might address them

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### Community Engagement Commitment (10 minutes)
- Each student writes down one specific action they commit to taking to improve their community engagement skills
- Students share their commitments with a partner
- Volunteers share their commitments with the whole class

### Permagarden Outreach Gallery Walk (20 minutes)

- Conclude with a brief discussion on common themes and innovative ideas observed

These activities are designed to be interactive, practical, and relevant to the lesson content on community engagement and outreach for permagardens in Timor-Leste. They encourage active participation, critical thinking, and application of key concepts to real-world scenarios.
