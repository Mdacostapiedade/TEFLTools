# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Measurement Scavenger Hunt
- Divide students into small groups
- Give each group a list of items to measure (e.g., length of a pencil, width of a desk, height of a door)
- Have groups estimate measurements first, then use rulers or meter sticks to check accuracy
- Discuss the importance of standardized units

## 2. Unit Conversion Race
- Write several unit conversion problems on the board (e.g., 5 km to m, 2000 g to kg)
- Have students race to solve them, either individually or in pairs
- Review answers as a class, discussing common conversion factors

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. SI Unit Exploration Stations
- Set up stations around the classroom, each focusing on a different SI base unit
- At each station, provide information about the unit, its symbol, and common prefixes
- Include hands-on materials for students to practice measurements (e.g., scales for mass, stopwatches for time)
- Have students rotate through stations, recording observations and measurements

## 2. Physics Branches Mind Map
- Introduce the main branches of physics on the board
- Have students create a mind map showing these branches and their interconnections
- Ask students to add examples of how each branch applies to life in Timor-Leste

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. SI vs. Traditional Units Comparison Project
- Assign each group a different physical quantity (length, mass, time, etc.)
- Have groups research traditional Timorese units for their assigned quantity
- Groups should create a poster comparing traditional units to SI units, including conversion factors
- Present findings to the class

## 2. Physics in Timor-Leste Gallery Walk
- Divide class into groups, each assigned a different area of physics (mechanics, thermodynamics, etc.)
- Groups create a poster showing:
  1. Brief description of their physics area
  2. Two examples of how it's applied in Timor-Leste
  3. One relevant measurement using SI units
- Display posters and have students do a gallery walk, leaving feedback on sticky notes

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Unit Conversion Worksheet
- Provide a worksheet with various unit conversion problems
- Include conversions between SI units and between SI and traditional Timorese units
- Encourage students to show their work using dimensional analysis

## 2. Physics Vocabulary Crossword
- Create a crossword puzzle using key terms from the lesson (physics, SI units, meter, kilogram, etc.)
- Provide definitions as clues
- Have students complete the puzzle independently

# Cool-down Activities

## 1. Three-Two-One Reflection
- Have students write down:
  - Three things they learned
  - Two things they found interesting
  - One question they still have

## 2. Physics Pictionary
- Divide class into teams
- Have students take turns drawing physics concepts or SI units for their team to guess
- Award points for correct guesses within a time limit

## 3. Exit Ticket
- Ask students to write a brief response to:
  "How might standardized measurements help in the development of Timor-Leste?"
- Collect responses as students leave the classroom
