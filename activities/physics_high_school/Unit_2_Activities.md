# Warm-up Activities

## Motion Scavenger Hunt
- In pairs, students list as many examples of motion they can observe from the classroom window in 2 minutes
- Share findings with the class, categorizing motions as one-dimensional or two-dimensional

## Concept Mapping
- Students create a quick mind map connecting terms like "distance," "displacement," "speed," "velocity," and "acceleration"
- Discuss as a class, addressing any misconceptions

# Main Lesson Activities

## Interactive Lecture
- Use animations and simulations to illustrate concepts of displacement, velocity, and acceleration
- Demonstrate the difference between average and instantaneous velocity using a toy car on a curved track

## Kinematic Equation Derivation
- Guide students through the derivation of kinematic equations, emphasizing their physical meaning
- Use visual aids to represent the relationships between displacement, velocity, time, and acceleration

## Projectile Motion Demonstration
- Launch a foam ball at different angles, having students predict landing spots
- Use slow-motion video to analyze the motion and introduce vector components

# Group Work Tasks

## Graph Interpretation Challenge
- In groups of 3-4, students analyze a set of position-time and velocity-time graphs
- Groups compete to correctly answer questions about displacement, velocity, and acceleration

## Kinematic Equation Problem-Solving Relay
- Teams line up and take turns solving parts of a multi-step kinematics problem
- Each student completes one step before passing to the next team member

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Conceptual Questions Worksheet
- Students complete a worksheet with multiple-choice and short-answer questions testing their understanding of key concepts

## Calculation Practice
- Provide a set of problems involving one-dimensional and two-dimensional motion for students to solve independently

# Cool-down Activities

## Motion Analysis App Exploration
- Demonstrate how to use a motion analysis app on smartphones
- Students practice tracking simple motions and interpreting the resulting graphs

## Exit Ticket
- Students write down:
  1. One new thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
  3. One real-world application of today's lesson

## Homework Preview
- Introduce the gravity measurement experiment homework
- Discuss potential approaches and safety considerations
