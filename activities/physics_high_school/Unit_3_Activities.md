# Warm-up Activities

## Force Tug-of-War
- Divide the class into two teams
- Have teams engage in a tug-of-war contest
- After the activity, discuss the forces involved and how they relate to Newton's laws

## Inertia Coin Trick
- Place a card on top of a glass with a coin on the card
- Quickly flick the card horizontally
- Observe the coin falling into the glass
- Discuss why this happens, introducing the concept of inertia

# Main Lesson Activities

## Newton's Laws Stations
Set up three stations, one for each of Newton's laws:

1. First Law Station: 
   - Stack cups and quickly pull a card from underneath
   - Observe how the cups remain in place

2. Second Law Station:
   - Use spring scales to measure force needed to accelerate objects of different masses
   - Record and compare results

3. Third Law Station:
   - Set up two skateboards with students sitting on them
   - Have students push off each other and observe the resulting motion

## Force Diagram Challenge
- Project images of various scenarios (e.g., book on a table, car on a hill)
- Students take turns drawing force diagrams on the whiteboard
- Class discusses and corrects diagrams as needed

# Group Work Tasks

## Real-World Forces Scavenger Hunt
- In small groups, students explore the school grounds
- Identify and document examples of different types of forces in action
- Create a presentation of their findings with explanations

## Simple Machine Design Challenge
- Groups design and build a simple machine using local materials
- Machine should demonstrate at least one of Newton's laws
- Present designs to the class, explaining the physics principles involved

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Force Calculation Worksheets
- Provide worksheets with various scenarios
- Students calculate net force, acceleration, or mass using F = ma
- Include problems relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., calculating forces on fishing boats)

## Free-Body Diagram Practice
- Give students a set of everyday objects and situations
- Have them draw accurate free-body diagrams for each
- Include peer review for feedback and discussion

# Cool-down Activities

## Newton's Laws Charades
- Students act out scenarios demonstrating Newton's laws
- Class guesses which law is being demonstrated and explains why

## Forces and Motion Quiz Game
- Create a Kahoot! or similar quiz game
- Include questions on key concepts from the lesson
- Play as a class, discussing answers after each question

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write a brief summary of the most important thing they learned
- Share a few responses with the class
- Use this to gauge understanding and inform future lessons
