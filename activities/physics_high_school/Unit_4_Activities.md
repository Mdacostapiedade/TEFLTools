# Warm-up Activities

## Energy Scavenger Hunt
- In pairs, students walk around the classroom or school grounds for 5 minutes
- Identify and list as many examples of energy transformations as possible
- Share findings with the class, discussing the types of energy involved in each example

## Quick Quiz
- Display images of various scenarios (e.g., person climbing stairs, car braking, wind turbine)
- Students hold up cards labeled with energy types (kinetic, potential, thermal, etc.)
- Briefly discuss correct answers and energy transformations involved

# Main Lesson Activities

## Work-Energy Theorem Demonstration
- Use a simple pulley system to lift a small weight
- Measure the force applied and distance moved
- Calculate work done and compare to change in potential energy
- Discuss the relationship between work and energy change

## Energy Conservation Experiment
- Set up a pendulum with a heavy bob
- Mark the starting height and release point
- Students predict and then measure the maximum height reached on the opposite side
- Discuss energy transformations and factors affecting the pendulum's motion

# Group Work Tasks

## Farming Tool Energy Analysis
- Divide class into groups, assign each a traditional Timorese farming tool (e.g., hoe, machete)
- Groups identify energy transformations involved in using the tool
- Calculate work done and power output for typical use of the tool
- Create a poster or digital presentation to share findings with the class

## Energy-Efficient Cooking Challenge
- In groups, students brainstorm energy-efficient cooking methods for rural Timor-Leste
- Consider available resources, cultural factors, and physics principles
- Design a simple prototype or detailed plan for their cooking method
- Present ideas to the class, explaining the energy efficiency improvements

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Work and Energy Calculations
1. A 50 kg sack of rice is lifted 2 meters. Calculate the work done and change in potential energy.
2. A 1000 W motor lifts an elevator. How long does it take to lift 4 passengers (75 kg each) up 3 floors (10 m)?
3. A 0.5 kg ball is thrown straight up with an initial velocity of 15 m/s. Calculate its maximum height and total energy.

## Energy Transformation Diagrams
- Provide scenarios (e.g., hydroelectric dam, solar panel, burning wood)
- Students draw energy flow diagrams showing transformations from one form to another
- Label each step with the type of energy and any energy losses

# Cool-down Activities

## Energy Conservation Game
- Students stand in a circle, each representing a form of energy
- Toss a ball around the circle, each student stating an energy transformation to the next form
- Challenge the class to keep the "energy" flowing without repeats or long pauses

## Exit Ticket: 3-2-1 Reflection
Students write down:
- 3 things they learned about work, energy, or power
- 2 questions they still have about the topic
- 1 way they could apply today's lesson to improve energy efficiency in their daily life
