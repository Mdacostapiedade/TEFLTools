# Warm-up Activities

## Spinning Top Challenge
- Divide students into groups of 3-4
- Provide each group with a traditional Timorese spinning top
- Challenge groups to spin their top for the longest time
- Have students record and compare spin times

## Angular Velocity Estimation
- Show videos of various rotating objects (ceiling fan, bicycle wheel, merry-go-round)
- Ask students to estimate which object has the highest angular velocity
- Discuss their reasoning and introduce the concept of angular velocity

# Main Lesson Activities

## Rotational Kinematics Demonstration
- Use a large rotating platform or lazy Susan
- Place markers at different radii
- Rotate the platform and have students observe the motion of markers
- Discuss how linear velocity changes with radius while angular velocity remains constant

## Torque Experiment
- Provide groups with a meter stick, string, and various weights
- Have students create a simple balance by suspending the meter stick from its center
- Ask them to investigate how the position and magnitude of weights affect the balance
- Introduce the concept of torque and its calculation

# Group Work Tasks

## Satellite Orbit Design Challenge
- Divide class into groups of 4-5
- Provide each group with orbital parameters for different satellite applications (communication, weather monitoring, GPS)
- Challenge groups to design a satellite orbit for a specific purpose over Timor-Leste
- Groups present their designs, explaining their choices based on Kepler's laws

## Rotational Inertia Investigation
- Provide groups with various objects (solid cylinder, hollow cylinder, sphere)
- Have them roll the objects down an inclined plane
- Ask groups to rank the objects based on their rotational inertia
- Discuss how shape and mass distribution affect rotational motion

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Angular Kinematics Calculations
- Provide students with data from the spinning top activity
- Have them calculate angular velocity and acceleration for different time intervals
- Ask students to graph angular velocity vs. time and interpret the results

## Orbital Motion Problem Set
- Give students a worksheet with problems related to satellite orbits
- Include calculations for orbital period, velocity, and altitude
- Provide real-world context by using data from satellites over Timor-Leste

# Cool-down Activities

## Physics Concept Map
- Have students create a concept map linking the key terms and ideas from the lesson
- Encourage them to show relationships between rotational motion and orbital dynamics

## Real-World Applications Discussion
- Facilitate a class discussion on how the concepts learned apply to daily life in Timor-Leste
- Prompt students to think about applications in agriculture, transportation, and communication

## One-Minute Paper
- Ask students to write a brief summary of the most important thing they learned and one question they still have
- Collect papers to assess understanding and address common questions in the next lesson
