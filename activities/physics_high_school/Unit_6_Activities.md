# Warm-up Activities

## Wave Properties Guessing Game
1. Display images of different types of waves (water waves, sound waves, light waves)
2. Students guess the type of wave and its properties (wavelength, frequency, amplitude)
3. Discuss similarities and differences between wave types

## Musical Instrument Show and Tell
1. Play recordings of different Timorese musical instruments
2. Students describe what they hear and how they think the sounds are produced
3. Introduce the concept of sound waves and vibrations

# Main Lesson Activities

## Slinky Wave Demonstration
1. Use a slinky to demonstrate transverse and longitudinal waves
2. Students observe and describe the differences between the two types of waves
3. Discuss real-world examples of each wave type

## Ripple Tank Experiment
1. Set up a ripple tank or large shallow pan with water
2. Demonstrate wave behaviors (reflection, refraction, diffraction)
3. Students sketch and label their observations

## Laser and Prism Demonstration
1. Use a laser pointer and prism to demonstrate reflection and refraction
2. Students draw ray diagrams to explain the observed phenomena
3. Discuss applications of reflection and refraction in everyday life

# Group Work Tasks

## Timorese Instrument Frequency Analysis
1. Divide students into small groups
2. Assign each group a different Timorese musical instrument
3. Groups use a smartphone app to measure and analyze the frequency of their instrument
4. Groups present their findings and explain how the instrument produces sound waves

## Simple Telescope Construction
1. Provide groups with materials to build simple telescopes (cardboard tubes, lenses)
2. Groups follow instructions to construct their telescopes
3. Test telescopes by observing distant objects
4. Groups explain how their telescopes work using principles of reflection and refraction

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Wave Properties Calculations
1. Provide students with a worksheet containing problems on wave calculations
2. Include questions on wavelength, frequency, and wave speed
3. Students work individually to solve the problems

## Ray Diagram Drawing
1. Give students scenarios involving reflection and refraction
2. Students draw accurate ray diagrams to illustrate each scenario
3. Include real-world applications like mirrors, lenses, and optical fibers

# Cool-down Activities

## Wave and Optics in Timor-Leste Discussion
1. Facilitate a class discussion on how waves and optics relate to everyday life in Timor-Leste
2. Encourage students to share personal experiences or observations
3. Discuss potential applications of wave and optics principles to solve local challenges

## Quick Quiz
1. Conduct a brief quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
2. Use a mix of multiple-choice and short-answer questions
3. Review answers as a class to reinforce understanding

## Concept Map Creation
1. Students create individual concept maps linking key terms and ideas from the lesson
2. Encourage students to include examples and applications
3. Share and compare concept maps in pairs or small groups
