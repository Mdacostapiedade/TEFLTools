# Warm-up Activities

## Environmental Changes Bingo

1. Create a bingo card with various environmental changes (e.g., less rainfall, warmer temperatures, coastal erosion).
2. Students mingle and ask each other about observed changes in their local area.
3. When they find someone who has observed a change on their card, they mark it off.
4. First to complete a line or full card wins.

## Earth System Components Charades

2. Students take turns acting out components without speaking.
3. Other students guess the component and discuss its role in the Earth system.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Earth System Jigsaw

1. Divide class into groups, each assigned an Earth system component.
2. Groups research their component and become "experts."
3. Regroup with one expert from each component to teach others.
4. New groups create a diagram showing interactions between components.

## Anthropocene Timeline

1. Create a large timeline on the classroom wall.
2. Provide cards with key events in human history and their environmental impacts.
3. Students place events on the timeline and discuss their significance.
4. Highlight the acceleration of impacts in recent decades.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Planetary Boundaries Debate

1. Assign pairs or small groups one of the nine planetary boundaries.
2. Groups research their boundary and prepare arguments for its importance.
3. Conduct a mock UN debate on which boundaries should be prioritized.
4. Class votes on the most convincing arguments.

## Local to Global Connections Map

1. In pairs, students choose a local environmental issue in Timor-Leste.
2. Using large paper, they create a map showing how the local issue connects to global Earth systems.
3. Pairs present their maps, explaining the connections they've identified.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Planetary Boundaries Infographic

1. Students choose one planetary boundary to research in depth.
2. They create an infographic explaining the boundary, its current status, and relevance to Timor-Leste.
3. Infographics are displayed in the classroom for a gallery walk.

## Earth System Science Crossword

1. Provide a crossword puzzle with clues related to Earth system science and planetary boundaries.
2. Students complete the puzzle individually, using their notes and handouts as needed.
3. Review answers as a class, clarifying any misunderstandings.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## One-Minute Paper

1. At the end of the lesson, give students one minute to write down:
   - The most important thing they learned
   - One question they still have
2. Collect papers and address common questions in the next lesson.

## Earth System Pictionary

1. Divide the class into teams.
2. One member from each team draws a concept from the lesson (e.g., tipping point, resilience).
3. Their team tries to guess the concept within a time limit.
4. Discuss the concepts as they are guessed, reinforcing key ideas.
