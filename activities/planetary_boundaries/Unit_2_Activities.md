# Engaging Activities for Climate Change and Ocean Acidification Lesson

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Climate Change Image Gallery Walk
- Set up stations around the classroom with before-and-after images of climate change impacts
- Students move from station to station, writing observations and questions on sticky notes
- Discuss findings as a class, focusing on observed changes and potential causes

### 2. "Two Truths and a Lie" Climate Edition
- In small groups, students write three statements about climate change, two true and one false
- Groups take turns presenting their statements to the class, who vote on which is the lie
- Use this to gauge existing knowledge and address common misconceptions

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Greenhouse Effect Demonstration
- Use a clear container, thermometer, and lamp to demonstrate the greenhouse effect
- Compare temperature changes with and without a plastic wrap "atmosphere"
- Students record observations and draw conclusions about greenhouse gases

### 2. Ocean Acidification Experiment
- Conduct a simple experiment using water, straws, and pH indicator
- Students blow through straws into water samples, observing color changes
- Relate this to CO2 absorption by oceans and discuss implications for marine life

### 3. Climate Change Impact Mapping
- Provide a large map of Timor-Leste
- Students use colored pins or stickers to mark areas vulnerable to different climate impacts
- Discuss patterns and potential consequences for communities and ecosystems

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Climate Change Sector Analysis
- Divide class into groups, each assigned a sector (e.g., agriculture, fisheries, water resources)
- Groups research and create a poster on climate change impacts for their sector
- Present findings to the class in a gallery walk format

### 2. Coral Reef Ecosystem Role Play
- Assign roles (e.g., coral, fish, algae, humans) to small groups
- Groups act out interactions in a healthy reef, then with increasing ocean acidification
- Debrief on observed changes and implications for reef ecosystems and coastal communities

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Personal Carbon Footprint Calculation
- Students use online calculators to determine their individual carbon footprints
- Reflect on results and write a short plan to reduce personal emissions

### 2. Climate Change News Analysis
- Provide recent news articles on climate change impacts in Timor-Leste
- Students summarize key points and evaluate the article's scientific accuracy

### 3. Sea Level Rise Prediction
- Using topographic maps and sea level rise projections, students identify areas at risk
- Calculate potential land loss and impacts on specific coastal communities

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. Climate Action Pledge
- Students write personal pledges for climate action on leaf-shaped papers
- Create a "Climate Action Tree" display with all pledges

### 2. One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute answering: "What's the most important thing you learned today, and what question do you still have?"
- Collect papers to assess understanding and address remaining questions in the next lesson

### 3. Climate Change Pictionary
- Quick game using key terms from the lesson
- Reinforces vocabulary and concepts in a fun, engaging way
