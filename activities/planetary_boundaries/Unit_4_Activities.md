# Warm-up Activities

## Nutrient Cycle Charades
1. Divide students into small groups
2. Each group receives a card with a process from the nitrogen or phosphorus cycle
3. Groups act out their process without speaking
4. Other students guess the process being portrayed

## Eutrophication in a Jar
1. Prepare jars with water and aquatic plants
2. Add different amounts of liquid fertilizer to each jar
3. Students observe and predict changes over the course of the lesson

# Main Lesson Activities

## Nutrient Cycle Mapping
1. Students create large-scale diagrams of nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on poster paper
2. Include natural processes and human impacts
3. Use different colors for natural vs. anthropogenic flows

## Virtual Field Trip
1. Use Google Earth to explore areas affected by nutrient pollution
2. Visit agricultural regions, water bodies with algal blooms, and wastewater treatment plants
3. Discuss observations and potential solutions for each location

# Group Work Tasks

## Fertilizer Detective
1. Groups receive samples of different fertilizers used in Timor-Leste
2. Analyze nutrient content, potential environmental impacts, and cost-effectiveness
3. Present findings and recommendations to the class

## Sustainable Farm Design
1. Groups design a small-scale sustainable farm for Timor-Leste
2. Include nutrient management strategies, crop rotation, and water conservation
3. Create a visual representation and present to the class

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Nutrient Flow Calculation
1. Students receive data on fertilizer use, crop yields, and runoff in a hypothetical farm
2. Calculate nutrient balances and efficiency
3. Suggest improvements to reduce nutrient loss

## Case Study Analysis
1. Provide a case study of a water body affected by eutrophication in Timor-Leste
2. Students identify causes, impacts, and potential solutions
3. Write a brief report with recommendations

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## Nutrient Cycle Jeopardy
1. Create a Jeopardy-style game with categories related to nitrogen and phosphorus cycles
2. Divide class into teams and play a quick round to review key concepts

## One-Minute Paper
1. Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned
2. Share responses with a partner
3. Discuss any remaining questions or unclear concepts as a class

## Sustainable Agriculture Pledge
1. Students write personal pledges for promoting sustainable nutrient management
2. Share pledges with the class
3. Display pledges in the classroom as a reminder of lesson objectives
