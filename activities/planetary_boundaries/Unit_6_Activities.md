# Warm-up Activities

## Air Quality Guessing Game
- Display images of cities with varying levels of air pollution
- Students guess the Air Quality Index (AQI) for each city
- Discuss factors that might contribute to different AQI levels

## Personal Experience Sharing
- Students share experiences of encountering air pollution (e.g., smog, smoke from fires)
- Discuss how these experiences affected their daily lives or health

# Main Lesson Activities

## Aerosol Demonstration
- Use a spray bottle with water to demonstrate how aerosols disperse in the air
- Discuss how different particles might behave similarly in the atmosphere

## Ozone Layer Protection Game
- Students form a human "ozone layer" by linking arms
- Designate some students as UV rays trying to break through
- Introduce "CFC" students who can break the ozone layer's links
- Discuss the real-world implications of this simulation

## Virtual Air Quality Monitor
- Use an online air quality monitoring platform to check real-time data for cities worldwide
- Compare air quality in Timor-Leste with other locations

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Aerosol Source Investigation
- In pairs, research different sources of aerosols (natural and anthropogenic)
- Create a poster or digital presentation on their findings

## Ozone Depletion Timeline
- Groups create a timeline of major events related to ozone depletion and recovery
- Include scientific discoveries, policy decisions, and environmental milestones

## Local Air Quality Assessment
- Groups survey their local area, identifying potential sources of air pollution
- Develop a map highlighting these sources and suggesting mitigation strategies

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Aerosol Impact Calculation
- Provide data on different types of aerosols and their effects on climate
- Students calculate the net warming or cooling effect for various scenarios

## Ozone Depletion Diagram
- Students create a detailed diagram illustrating the process of ozone depletion
- Label key components and chemical reactions involved

## Personal Air Quality Journal
- Students keep a week-long journal tracking local air quality and their activities
- Reflect on how air quality affects their daily lives and health

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Air Quality Solutions Brainstorm
- Quick-fire round where students suggest solutions to improve air quality in Timor-Leste
- Categorize solutions into personal, community, and government-level actions

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned about atmospheric aerosols or ozone depletion
- Share responses with a partner or the class

## Pledge for Clean Air
- Students write a personal pledge detailing one action they will take to reduce air pollution
- Display pledges in the classroom or school to raise awareness
