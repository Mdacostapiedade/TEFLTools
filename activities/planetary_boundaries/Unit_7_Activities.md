# Warm-up Activities

## Plastic Item Timeline
1. Display various plastic items (e.g., water bottle, shopping bag, food container).
2. Ask students to arrange them in order of how long they think each item takes to decompose.
3. Reveal correct decomposition times and discuss the longevity of plastic pollution.

## Chemical Pollution Word Association
1. Write "Chemical Pollution" on the board.
2. Have students call out words they associate with the term.
3. Group similar ideas and discuss common themes that emerge.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Novel Entities Gallery Walk
1. Create posters around the room with information on different novel entities.
2. Students move from poster to poster, taking notes on each type of pollutant.
3. Discuss findings as a class, focusing on impacts specific to Timor-Leste.

## Pollution Pathway Mapping
1. Provide students with a large map of Timor-Leste.
2. Students use colored strings to trace potential pathways of different pollutants.
3. Discuss how pollutants move through ecosystems and affect different areas.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Pollution Solution Brainstorming
1. Divide students into small groups.
2. Assign each group a specific type of pollution affecting Timor-Leste.
3. Groups brainstorm potential solutions, considering local resources and constraints.
4. Present ideas to the class for feedback and discussion.

## Waste Management Role Play
1. Assign roles to groups (e.g., government officials, environmentalists, industry representatives, community members).
2. Present a scenario of a waste management crisis in a Timorese town.
3. Groups discuss and negotiate solutions from their assigned perspectives.
4. Debrief on the challenges of balancing different stakeholder interests.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Pollution Diary
1. Students keep a diary for a week, noting all single-use plastics they use.
2. Calculate the potential environmental impact if this usage continued for a year.
3. Reflect on ways to reduce personal plastic consumption.

## Chemical Pollutant Fact Sheet
1. Assign each student a specific chemical pollutant relevant to Timor-Leste.
2. Create an informative fact sheet including sources, impacts, and potential solutions.
3. Share fact sheets in a class "pollutant database."

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## One-Minute Paper
1. Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned about novel entities and chemical pollution.
2. Share responses with a partner and then with the class.
3. Discuss common themes and lingering questions.

## Pollution Prevention Pledge
1. Students write a personal pledge to reduce their contribution to chemical pollution.
2. Share pledges in small groups and offer support/suggestions to each other.
3. Display pledges in the classroom as a reminder of personal commitments.
