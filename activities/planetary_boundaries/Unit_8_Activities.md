# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Environmental Challenges Brainstorm
- Students work in small groups to list as many environmental challenges in Timor-Leste as they can in 3 minutes.
- Groups share their lists, and the class creates a master list on the whiteboard.
- Discuss how these local challenges might connect to global planetary boundaries.

## 2. Planetary Boundaries Matching Game
- Create cards with names and brief descriptions of the nine planetary boundaries.
- Students work in pairs to match the names with the descriptions.
- Review answers as a class, discussing any unfamiliar concepts.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Planetary Boundaries Interactive Diagram
- Project an interactive diagram of planetary boundaries on the screen.
- As each boundary is discussed, students come up to the diagram to highlight connections and potential impacts on Timor-Leste.

## 2. SDG-Planetary Boundaries Alignment Activity
- Provide students with cards representing the 17 SDGs and the 9 planetary boundaries.
- In small groups, students create a visual map showing how SDGs align with or impact different planetary boundaries.
- Groups present their maps, explaining their reasoning for the connections made.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Stakeholder Role Play
- Assign different stakeholder roles to pairs or small groups (e.g., government official, farmer, business owner, environmental activist).
- Each group discusses a specific environmental challenge in Timor-Leste from their stakeholder's perspective.
- Groups then come together to negotiate and develop a collaborative solution.

## 2. Policy Analysis and Improvement
- Provide groups with a current environmental policy from Timor-Leste.
- Groups analyze the policy, identifying strengths and weaknesses in relation to planetary boundaries.
- They then propose improvements to the policy, considering multiple stakeholder perspectives.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Personal Sustainability Action Plan
- Students create a personal action plan to reduce their impact on planetary boundaries.
- They set specific, measurable goals for areas such as water use, waste reduction, and energy consumption.

## 2. Case Study Analysis
- Provide students with a case study of a successful sustainable development project from another developing country.
- Students analyze the case study, identifying key factors for success and potential applications to Timor-Leste.
- They write a brief report summarizing their findings and recommendations.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the question: "What was the most important thing you learned today about planetary boundaries and sustainable development in Timor-Leste?"
- Volunteers share their responses, and the class discusses common themes.

## 2. Sustainability Commitment Chain
- Students stand in a circle and take turns sharing one commitment they'll make to promote sustainability in their community.
- Each student links arms with the previous speaker, creating a physical "chain" of commitments.
- Discuss how individual actions can collectively contribute to staying within planetary boundaries.
