# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Agricultural Challenge Gallery Walk

- Set up stations around the classroom with images and brief descriptions of agricultural challenges in Timor Leste (e.g., disease-affected crops, low-yielding varieties, soil erosion).
- Have students rotate through the stations in small groups, discussing potential solutions for each challenge.
- Encourage students to think creatively and consider both traditional and modern approaches.

## 2. Plant Biotechnology Word Cloud

- Use an online word cloud generator to create a visual representation of terms related to plant biotechnology and tissue culture.
- Display the word cloud and ask students to identify terms they recognize and explain their understanding of them.
- Use this as a springboard to introduce new vocabulary and concepts.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Plant Biotechnology Timeline

- Create a large timeline on a wall or whiteboard.
- Provide students with cards containing significant events or discoveries in plant biotechnology history.
- Have students place their cards on the timeline and briefly explain the importance of each event.

## 2. Tissue Culture Virtual Lab Tour

- Use online resources or videos to take students on a virtual tour of a plant tissue culture laboratory.
- As you "move" through the lab, explain the purpose of different equipment and areas.
- Pause at key points to ask students questions about what they observe and how it relates to the concepts being taught.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Tissue Culture Application Brainstorming

- Divide the class into small groups, each focusing on a different sector of Timor Leste's agriculture (e.g., food crops, cash crops, forestry).
- Have groups brainstorm potential applications of tissue culture in their assigned sector.
- Groups create a mind map or poster to present their ideas to the class.

## 2. Tissue Culture Debate

- Assign groups to argue for or against the implementation of tissue culture techniques in Timor Leste.
- Provide time for research and preparation of arguments.
- Conduct a structured debate, encouraging critical thinking about the benefits and challenges of adopting this technology.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Tissue Culture Concept Map

- Provide students with a partially completed concept map on plant tissue culture.
- Have them fill in the missing connections and concepts based on the lesson content.
- Encourage students to add additional branches or concepts they find relevant.

## 2. Plant Biotechnology News Article Analysis

- Provide recent news articles on plant biotechnology applications in developing countries.
- Have students read and summarize the main points, identifying how the technology was applied and its impact.
- Ask students to reflect on how similar approaches could benefit Timor Leste.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Plant Biotechnology Quiz Show

- Divide the class into teams and conduct a quiz show-style review of the lesson's key concepts.
- Use a mix of multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer questions to cover various aspects of plant biotechnology and tissue culture.

## 2. Future Vision Board

- Provide students with art supplies or digital tools to create a vision board.
- Ask them to illustrate their vision of how plant biotechnology and tissue culture could transform Timor Leste's agriculture in the next 10-20 years.
- Have volunteers share and explain their vision boards with the class.

## 3. One-Minute Paper

- In the last minute of class, have students write down:
  1. The most important thing they learned today
  2. One question they still have about plant biotechnology or tissue culture
- Collect the papers to inform future lessons and address any remaining questions in the next class.
