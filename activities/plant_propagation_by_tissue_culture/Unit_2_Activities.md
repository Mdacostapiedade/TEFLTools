# Warm-up Activities

## Contamination Detectives
- Divide students into pairs
- Each pair lists potential sources of contamination in a laboratory setting
- After 5 minutes, pairs share ideas with the class
- Compile a master list on the board
- Discuss the most common and surprising sources of contamination

## Vocabulary Matching Game
- Create cards with key vocabulary terms and their definitions
- Students work in small groups to match terms with definitions
- First group to correctly match all terms wins
- Review correct matches as a class

# Main Lesson Activities

## Handwashing Relay Race
- Divide class into teams
- Each team member must properly wash hands and put on gloves
- Teams are timed, with penalties for incorrect technique
- Discuss proper technique and common mistakes after the race

## Makeshift Laminar Flow Hood Construction
- Provide materials (clear plastic storage box, plastic wrap, scissors, tape)
- Demonstrate how to create a makeshift laminar flow hood
- Students work in small groups to construct their own
- Test effectiveness using smoke or fog machine

## Microscope Contamination Hunt
- Provide prepared slides with common contaminants
- Students observe slides under microscopes
- Draw and label what they see
- Discuss how to identify different types of contamination

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Sterilization Method Comparison
- Assign different sterilization methods to pairs (e.g., autoclaving, chemical sterilization)
- Pairs research their assigned method
- Create a poster or digital presentation on the method's pros and cons
- Present findings to the class

## Contamination Prevention Role-play
- Groups create short skits demonstrating proper and improper laboratory practices
- Perform skits for the class
- Audience identifies correct and incorrect behaviors

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Glove Removal Challenge
- Students practice proper glove removal technique
- Use fluorescent powder on gloves to simulate contamination
- Check hands under UV light after removal
- Students repeat until they can remove gloves without "contamination"

## Sterile Transfer Technique
- Provide students with sterile petri dishes, agar plates, and transfer tools
- Practice transferring agar plugs between plates using aseptic technique
- Incubate plates to check for contamination
- Students evaluate their technique based on results

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Sterile Technique Quiz Show
- Divide class into teams
- Ask multiple-choice questions about key concepts covered in the lesson
- Teams earn points for correct answers
- Winning team gets a small prize (e.g., sterile lab gloves)

## Reflection Circle
- Students sit in a circle
- Pass around a "talking stick"
- Each student shares one new thing they learned and one question they still have
- Address unanswered questions as a class or assign as further research

## Laboratory Safety Pledge
- Students write a personal pledge to maintain sterile techniques and laboratory safety
- Share pledges with a partner
- Display pledges in the laboratory as a reminder of best practices
