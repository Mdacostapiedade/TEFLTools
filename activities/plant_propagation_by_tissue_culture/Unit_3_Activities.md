# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Plant Needs Pictionary (10 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group draws a plant need (e.g., water, sunlight, nutrients) without using words
- Other groups guess the plant need
- Discuss how these needs relate to growth media

## 2. Media Component Matching Game (5 minutes)
- Prepare cards with names of media components and their functions
- Students match the component to its function
- Review answers as a class

# Main Lesson Activities
