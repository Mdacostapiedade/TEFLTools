# Warm-up Activities

## Plant Part Scavenger Hunt
- Divide students into small groups
- Give each group a list of plant parts (e.g., leaf, stem, root, flower bud)
- Have groups search the classroom or nearby outdoor area to find and collect these parts
- Discuss which parts might be good candidates for explants and why

## Explant Matching Game
- Create cards with names of plant species and cards with ideal explant types
- Have students work in pairs to match the plant species with the most suitable explant type
- Discuss the matches as a class, explaining the reasoning behind each choice

# Main Lesson Activities

## Explant Selection Criteria Brainstorm
- In small groups, have students brainstorm criteria for selecting good explants
- Each group presents their ideas to the class
- Compile a master list of criteria on the board
- Compare the class-generated list with expert recommendations

## Surface Sterilization Demonstration
- Instructor demonstrates the complete surface sterilization process
- Students take notes and ask questions
- Discuss potential adaptations for different plant materials

## Microscope Observation (if available)
- Prepare slides of different plant tissues (meristematic vs. differentiated)
- Have students observe the slides under microscopes
- Students sketch and label what they see, noting differences between tissue types

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Explant Selection Challenge
- Provide groups with a variety of plant materials
- Challenge them to select the best explants for tissue culture
- Groups present their selections to the class, justifying their choices

## Surface Sterilization Protocol Design
- Assign each group a different plant species
- Groups research and design a specific surface sterilization protocol for their assigned species
- Groups create a poster or digital presentation of their protocol to share with the class

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Explant Preparation Simulation
- Provide each student with a soft, plant-like material (e.g., foam, modeling clay)
- Students practice making precise cuts to create appropriately sized "explants"
- Instructor evaluates technique and provides feedback

## Sterilization Steps Sequencing
- Create a set of cards describing each step of the surface sterilization process
- Students arrange the cards in the correct order
- They then write a brief explanation for why each step is important

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Explant Selection Quiz
- Quick multiple-choice quiz on key concepts of explant selection and preparation
- Students can use personal devices or paper for the quiz
- Review answers as a class, clarifying any misunderstandings

## Reflection Circle
- Form a circle with the entire class
- Each student shares one new thing they learned and one question they still have
- Encourage peer-to-peer responses to questions

## Explant Preparation Pictionary
- Divide class into teams
- One student from each team draws a step of the explant preparation process
- Team members guess the step being illustrated
- First team to guess correctly earns a point
- Rotate through team members until all steps have been covered
