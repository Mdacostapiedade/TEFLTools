# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Sterile Technique Charades (10 minutes)
- Students act out proper sterile techniques without speaking
- Other students guess the technique being demonstrated
- Examples: putting on gloves, flame sterilizing tools, working in laminar flow hood

## 2. Explant Identification Race (5 minutes)
- Display various plant parts suitable for explants
- Students race to correctly identify and label each part
- Discuss why certain parts make good explants for tissue culture

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Inoculation Demonstration and Practice (20 minutes)
- Instructor demonstrates proper inoculation technique
- Students practice the technique using mock explants and media
- Peers provide feedback on technique

## 2. Environmental Factors Puzzle (15 minutes)
- Create a puzzle with different environmental factors affecting culture growth
- Students assemble the puzzle, matching factors to their optimal conditions
- Discuss how these factors influence culture success

## 3. Subculturing Simulation (20 minutes)
- Use play dough or clay to represent cultures
- Students practice dividing and transferring "cultures" to new containers
- Emphasize sterile technique and proper handling

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Culture Monitoring Plan Development (30 minutes)
- In pairs, students develop a monitoring plan for a specific plant culture
- Include frequency of checks, what to observe, and how to record data
- Groups present their plans to the class for feedback

## 2. Troubleshooting Scenarios (20 minutes)
- Provide groups with different culture problem scenarios
- Groups discuss possible causes and solutions
- Present findings to the class for a collaborative problem-solving session

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Media Recipe Calculation (15 minutes)
- Provide students with a basic media recipe
- Have them calculate the amounts needed for different culture volumes
- Check calculations for accuracy and discuss the importance of precise measurements

## 2. Culture Growth Sketching (10 minutes)
- Show time-lapse videos or images of culture growth
- Students sketch the stages of growth and label key changes
- Discuss observations and what they indicate about culture health

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Culture Care Bingo (10 minutes)
- Create bingo cards with various culture care tasks and concepts
- Call out descriptions of tasks or concepts
- Students mark their cards, reinforcing key points from the lesson

## 2. One-Minute Paper (5 minutes)
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
- Collect papers to assess understanding and address remaining questions in the next class

## 3. Tissue Culture Telephone (10 minutes)
- Students form a line and pass a whispered message about tissue culture procedure
- Compare the final message to the original
- Discuss the importance of clear communication in lab work
