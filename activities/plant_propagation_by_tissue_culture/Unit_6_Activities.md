# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Micropropagation Benefits Brainstorm (10 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group brainstorms potential benefits of micropropagation for Timor Leste's agriculture
- Groups share their top 3 ideas with the class
- Create a master list on the board

## 2. Vocabulary Matching Game (10 minutes)
- Prepare cards with key vocabulary terms and their definitions
- Students work in pairs to match terms with definitions
- Review correct matches as a class

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Micropropagation Methods Jigsaw (30 minutes)
- Divide class into 5 expert groups, each assigned a micropropagation method
- Groups research their method and create a brief presentation
- Regroup into new teams with one expert from each method
- Experts teach their method to their new group

## 2. Virtual Lab Tour (20 minutes)
- Show a virtual tour of a plant tissue culture laboratory
- Students identify and list equipment and their functions
- Discuss how each item contributes to maintaining sterile conditions

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Shoot Tip Culture Protocol Design (30 minutes)
- In groups of 3-4, students design a step-by-step protocol for shoot tip culture
- Groups create a flowchart or infographic of their protocol
- Present and compare protocols, discussing variations and rationales

## 2. Callus Induction Experiment Planning (25 minutes)
- Groups plan an experiment to induce callus in a local crop plant
- Define variables, controls, and expected outcomes
- Create a materials list and timeline for the experiment

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Micropropagation Technique Comparison Table (15 minutes)
- Students create a table comparing different micropropagation techniques
- Include columns for method, advantages, disadvantages, and suitable plant types
- Share and discuss completed tables with a partner

## 2. Sterile Technique Simulation (20 minutes)
- Set up workstations with mock sterile equipment (can use everyday items)
- Students individually practice proper hand washing, gloving, and sterile transfer techniques
- Peer evaluation of technique using a checklist

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Micropropagation Quiz Game (15 minutes)
- Divide class into teams
- Play a Jeopardy-style quiz game with categories based on lesson content
- Award points for correct answers and explanations

## 2. Reflection and Application (10 minutes)
- Students write a brief reflection on how micropropagation could benefit a specific crop or plant in Timor Leste
- Share reflections in pairs or small groups
- Collect reflections to inform future lessons and projects

## 3. Exit Ticket (5 minutes)
- Students complete a short form answering:
  1. One new thing I learned today
  2. One question I still have
  3. One way I might use this knowledge in the future
