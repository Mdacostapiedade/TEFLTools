# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Environmental Differences Charades

- Divide students into small groups.
- Each group draws a card with an environmental factor (e.g., humidity, light intensity, CO2 levels).
- Groups take turns acting out the difference between in vitro and ex vitro conditions for their factor.
- Other groups guess the factor and explain its importance in acclimatization.

## 2. Plant Adaptation Brainstorm

- Students work in pairs to list as many plant adaptations as they can think of in 2 minutes.
- Pairs share their lists with the class, discussing which adaptations might be important for acclimatization.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Acclimatization Station Rotation

- Set up stations around the classroom, each focusing on a different aspect of acclimatization:
  1. Humidity control
  2. Light intensity adjustment
  3. Temperature regulation
  4. Air circulation
- Students rotate through stations, completing hands-on tasks and recording observations.

## 2. Transplanting Demonstration and Practice

- Instructor demonstrates proper transplanting technique.
- Students practice transplanting tissue-cultured plants, receiving feedback from peers and instructor.

## 3. Acclimatization Chamber Design Challenge

- In small groups, students design and construct a simple acclimatization chamber using provided materials.
- Groups present their designs, explaining how they address key environmental factors.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Acclimatization Protocol Development

- Assign each group a different local plant species.
- Groups research the plant's natural habitat and growth requirements.
- Develop a detailed acclimatization protocol for their assigned species.
- Create a poster or digital presentation to share with the class.

## 2. Troubleshooting Scenarios

- Provide groups with case studies of acclimatization problems (e.g., wilting, fungal growth).
- Groups discuss possible causes and solutions.
- Role-play a consultation with a farmer, offering advice on how to address the issue.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Acclimatization Data Analysis

- Provide students with a dataset from a previous acclimatization experiment.
- Students graph the data and write a short analysis of the results.
- Identify key turning points in the acclimatization process and suggest improvements.

## 2. Stomata Observation and Drawing

- Students examine leaf samples from in vitro and ex vitro plants under a microscope.
- Draw and label stomata, noting differences between the two samples.
- Write a brief explanation of how these differences relate to acclimatization.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Acclimatization Process Sequencing

- Provide students with cards describing steps in the acclimatization process.
- Students work individually to arrange the cards in the correct sequence.
- Discuss the correct order as a class, emphasizing the rationale for each step.

## 2. One-Minute Paper

- Students write for one minute on the prompt: "What do you think is the most critical factor in successful acclimatization, and why?"
- Share responses with a partner and then with the class.

## 3. Acclimatization Bingo

- Create bingo cards with key terms and concepts from the lesson.
- Call out definitions or descriptions, and students mark off the corresponding terms on their cards.
- First student to complete a row wins and explains the concepts in that row to the class.
