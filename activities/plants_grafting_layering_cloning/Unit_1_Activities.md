# Engaging Activities for Introduction to Plant Propagation in Timor Leste

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Plant Identification Race
- Divide the class into small groups
- Display various native plant samples around the room
- Groups compete to correctly identify and list as many plants as possible in 5 minutes
- Discuss the winning group's list and any interesting observations

### 2. Plant Use Brainstorm
- Show images of common Timorese plants on a slideshow
- Students call out different uses for each plant (e.g., food, medicine, construction)
- Create a mind map on the board linking plants to their various uses

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Propagation Method Matching
- Provide students with cards describing different propagation methods
- Display images of various plants on the board
- Students match propagation methods to the most suitable plants and explain their choices

### 2. Biodiversity Importance Debate
- Divide the class into two groups
- One group argues for the importance of biodiversity in agriculture
- The other group presents counterarguments
- Conclude with a class discussion on finding a balance between biodiversity and agricultural productivity

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Propagation Plan Design
- In pairs, students choose a native Timorese plant
- They research and design a propagation plan for that plant
- Pairs present their plans to the class, explaining their chosen methods and reasoning

### 2. Native Plant Conservation Campaign
- In small groups, students create a public awareness campaign
- Focus on the importance of preserving and propagating a specific native plant species
- Groups develop slogans, posters, and short presentations for their campaigns

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Plant Part Labeling
- Provide students with blank diagrams of different plants
- Students label the parts of the plant that can be used for various propagation methods
- Include a short written explanation for each labeled part

### 2. Propagation Method Flowchart
- Students create a flowchart showing the steps of a chosen propagation method
- Include decision points (e.g., "Is the cutting showing roots?")
- Add illustrations to visually represent each step

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. Propagation Quiz Bowl
- Divide the class into teams
- Ask rapid-fire questions about plant propagation and native Timorese plants
- Award points for correct answers and explanations

### 2. One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the prompt: "What is the most important thing you learned about plant propagation today, and why is it significant for Timor Leste?"
- Volunteers share their responses with the class

### 3. Propagation Pictionary
- Create cards with plant propagation terms and concepts
- Students take turns drawing the terms while their teammates guess
- Discuss each term briefly after it's guessed correctly
