# Engaging Activities for Advanced Grafting Techniques Lesson

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Graft Detective
- Divide students into pairs
- Provide each pair with a set of grafted plant samples (both successful and failed)
- Students examine the samples and list possible reasons for success or failure
- Class discussion on critical factors for successful grafting

### 2. Grafting Vocabulary Race
- Create word cards with key grafting terms and their definitions
- Divide class into teams
- Teams race to match terms with definitions
- First team to correctly match all terms wins

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Approach Grafting Demonstration
- Instructor demonstrates approach grafting technique
- Students take notes and sketch the process
- Q&A session to clarify steps and principles

### 2. Bridge Grafting Simulation
- Set up stations with mock damaged tree trunks
- Demonstrate bridge grafting technique
- Students rotate through stations to practice the technique

### 3. Grafting for Resilience Presentation
- Short lecture on using grafting for disease resistance and climate adaptation
- Show case studies relevant to Timor Leste
- Students brainstorm potential applications for local crops

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Grafting Technique Carousel
- Set up stations for different grafting techniques
- Divide students into groups
- Groups rotate through stations, practicing each technique
- Peer teaching and feedback at each station

### 2. Troubleshooting Scenarios
- Provide groups with different grafting problem scenarios
- Groups discuss and develop solutions
- Present solutions to class for feedback

### 3. Grafting Strategy Design
- Assign each group a local plant species
- Groups design a grafting strategy to improve its resilience
- Create a poster to present their strategy to the class

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Precision Grafting Practice
- Provide each student with rootstock and scion material
- Students practice making precise cuts and aligning cambium
- Instructor provides individual feedback

### 2. Grafting Journal
- Students maintain a grafting journal throughout the lesson
- Record observations, sketches, and reflections on each technique learned
- Include plans for future application of techniques

### 3. Scion Preparation Challenge
- Provide students with various types of scion wood
- Challenge them to prepare scions correctly for different grafting methods
- Assess preparation quality and provide feedback

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. Grafting Technique Charades
- Students act out different grafting techniques without speaking
- Class guesses the technique being demonstrated
- Discuss key characteristics that identify each technique

### 2. One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on:
  * Most important thing learned
  * One question they still have
  * How they plan to apply a new technique
- Share responses with a partner or small group

### 3. Grafting Advice Column
- Students write a short "advice column" entry
- Address a common grafting problem with solutions
- Share advice with class and compile into a class grafting guide
