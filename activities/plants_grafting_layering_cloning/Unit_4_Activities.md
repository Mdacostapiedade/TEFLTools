# Warm-up Activities

## Plant Propagation Charades
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group draws a card with a propagation method or plant part
- Groups take turns acting out their term while others guess
- Terms include: stem cutting, air layering, grafting, adventitious roots, etc.

## Mystery Cutting Challenge
- Present students with various plant cuttings
- In pairs, students examine the cuttings and hypothesize the best propagation method
- Share and discuss ideas as a class

# Main Lesson Activities

## Propagation Station Rotation
- Set up stations for different propagation techniques:
  1. Stem cuttings
  2. Leaf cuttings
  3. Air layering
  4. Simple layering
  5. Root cuttings
- Students rotate through stations, practicing each technique
- Provide step-by-step guides and materials at each station

## Propagation Environment Design
- Students design an ideal propagation environment for a specific plant
- Include factors like humidity, temperature, light, and growing medium
- Present designs to the class, explaining choices

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Propagation Method Debate
- Assign pairs different propagation methods for a specific plant
- Pairs research and prepare arguments for why their method is best
- Hold a class debate on the merits of each method

## Native Plant Propagation Plan
- In small groups, choose a native Timor Leste plant
- Develop a comprehensive propagation plan
- Include method selection, timeline, care instructions, and potential challenges
- Present plans to the class for feedback

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Propagation Journal
- Students start a propagation journal
- Document attempts at various techniques
- Include observations, sketches, and reflections on successes and failures

## Rooting Hormone Experiment
- Students set up an experiment testing rooting hormone effectiveness
- Use the same plant species with different hormone concentrations
- Record and analyze results over time

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Propagation Quiz Game
- Create a Jeopardy-style quiz game with categories like:
  - Propagation Methods
  - Plant Anatomy
  - Timor Leste Native Plants
  - Troubleshooting
- Play in teams to review key concepts

## Reflection Circle
- Form a circle and pass around a "talking stick"
- Each student shares:
  - One new thing they learned
  - One thing they want to try at home
  - One question they still have

## Future Propagator Vision Board
- Students create a vision board for their future as plant propagators
- Include goals, plants they want to work with, and potential projects
- Share vision boards in small groups or display in the classroom
