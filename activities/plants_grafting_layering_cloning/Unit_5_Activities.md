# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Rootstock-Scion Matching Game
- Divide students into pairs
- Provide each pair with a set of cards featuring various rootstocks and scions
- Have students match the appropriate rootstocks and scions based on compatibility
- Discuss the matches as a class, explaining why certain combinations work well

## 2. Plant Part Identification Race
- Display a large image or diagram of a grafted plant
- Have students race to label different parts (rootstock, scion, graft union, etc.)
- First student to correctly label all parts wins

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Rootstock Characteristics Analysis
- Provide students with samples of different rootstocks
- Have them examine and record observations about:
  * Root structure
  * Stem thickness
  * Leaf characteristics
- Discuss how these features relate to plant performance in Timor Leste's conditions

## 2. Compatibility Demonstration
- Set up microscopes or provide hand lenses
- Show students samples of successful and unsuccessful graft unions
- Guide them in identifying the cambium layer and signs of compatibility/incompatibility

## 3. Rootstock Impact Simulation
- Use a computer simulation or interactive diagram
- Allow students to manipulate rootstock variables (e.g., vigor, disease resistance)
- Observe and discuss how changes affect overall plant performance

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Rootstock Selection Scenario
- Divide class into small groups
- Present each group with a scenario (e.g., drought-prone area, disease-prevalent region)
- Have groups research and recommend suitable rootstocks for the given conditions
- Groups present their recommendations to the class

## 2. Compatibility Chart Creation
- In pairs, have students create a compatibility chart for local fruit tree species
- Provide resources on genetic relatedness and known successful combinations
- Pairs share their charts, discussing any differences or interesting findings

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Rootstock Evaluation Worksheet
- Provide students with data on various rootstock performances in Timor Leste
- Have them analyze the data and answer questions about:
  * Best performers for specific traits (e.g., drought tolerance, yield)
  * Recommendations for different growing conditions
  * Potential trade-offs between different rootstock choices

## 2. Graft Union Diagram
- Students draw and label a detailed diagram of a graft union
- Include key structures and explain their functions
- Highlight potential issues that could arise from poor technique

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Rootstock-Scion Speed Dating
- Set up stations around the room with different rootstock samples
- Students rotate through stations, spending 1 minute at each to list compatible scions and potential benefits/drawbacks
- Discuss findings as a class, addressing any misconceptions

## 2. Propagation Technique Charades
- Write various propagation techniques on slips of paper
- Students take turns acting out the techniques without speaking
- Class guesses the technique and discusses its relevance to rootstock/scion selection

## 3. One-Minute Paper
- At the end of class, give students one minute to write down:
  * The most important thing they learned about rootstock selection
  * One question they still have about the topic
- Collect papers to inform future lessons and address remaining questions
