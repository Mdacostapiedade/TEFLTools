# Engaging Activities for Nursery Management Lesson

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Nursery Element Scavenger Hunt
- Divide students into pairs
- Provide each pair with a list of 10 common nursery elements (e.g., mist system, potting soil, shade cloth)
- Give students 5 minutes to find images or examples of these elements using their smartphones or provided resources
- First pair to find all items wins

### 2. Plant Propagation Charades
- Write various propagation methods and nursery tasks on slips of paper
- Students take turns acting out the tasks while others guess
- Examples: watering plants, taking cuttings, grafting, transplanting seedlings

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Virtual Nursery Tour
- Use a video or interactive online tour of a well-designed nursery
- As students watch, have them complete a worksheet identifying key components and their functions
- Discuss observations as a class afterward

### 2. Microclimate Mapping Exercise
- Provide students with a blank nursery layout
- Have them map out different microclimates within the nursery (e.g., high humidity areas, cooler zones)
- Students explain their reasoning for each microclimate placement

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Nursery Design Challenge
- Divide class into small groups
- Assign each group a specific nursery purpose (e.g., native tree propagation, vegetable seedling production)
- Groups create a detailed nursery layout including all necessary components
- Present designs to the class for peer feedback

### 2. IPM Strategy Development
- Assign each group a common nursery pest or disease
- Groups research and develop an IPM strategy for their assigned problem
- Create a poster or digital presentation to share with the class

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Propagation Protocol Development
- Each student chooses a native Timorese plant species
- Develop a detailed propagation protocol including nursery setup, care requirements, and pest management
- Create a step-by-step guide or flowchart for the chosen species

### 2. Nursery Management Simulation
- Provide students with a virtual or paper-based nursery management simulation
- Students make decisions on watering, fertilization, pest control, and plant care over a simulated growing season
- Analyze the outcomes of their management decisions

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. Nursery Management Quiz Game
- Divide class into teams
- Use an online quiz platform (e.g., Kahoot) to test knowledge of key nursery management concepts
- Award points for correct answers and speed

### 2. Reflection Web
- Students stand in a circle
- Toss a ball of yarn to a student who shares one key takeaway from the lesson
- That student then tosses the yarn to another, holding onto their strand
- Continue until a web is formed, visually representing the interconnected nature of nursery management concepts

### 3. One-Minute Paper
- In the last minute of class, have students write down:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
- Collect papers to inform future lessons and address any lingering questions
