# Engaging Activities for Conservation and Restoration Applications Lesson

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Ecosystem Restoration Puzzle

- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a large puzzle piece-shaped paper
- Each group draws or writes about one aspect of ecosystem restoration (e.g., soil preparation, seed collection, planting)
- Groups present their pieces and assemble them to form a complete "restoration puzzle"

### 2. Plant Propagation Charades

- Write various propagation techniques on slips of paper
- Students take turns acting out the techniques without speaking
- Other students guess the technique being demonstrated

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Ex Situ Conservation Simulation

- Set up stations around the classroom representing different ex situ conservation methods (e.g., seed bank, botanical garden, tissue culture lab)
- Students rotate through stations, learning about each method
- At each station, students complete a task related to that conservation method

### 2. Endangered Species Rescue Mission

- Assign each student group an endangered plant species from Timor Leste
- Groups research their species and create a "rescue plan" using appropriate propagation techniques
- Present plans to the class, justifying their chosen methods

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Propagation Technique Debate

- Divide class into pairs or small groups
- Assign each group two propagation techniques
- Groups debate the pros and cons of each technique for conservation purposes
- Class votes on most convincing arguments

### 2. Conservation Garden Design

- In groups, students design a small conservation garden for rare native species
- Include propagation areas, display areas, and educational signage
- Groups create a visual representation (poster or digital) of their garden design

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Propagation Protocol Development

- Each student selects a native plant species
- Develop a detailed propagation protocol for that species
- Include step-by-step instructions, materials needed, and potential challenges

### 2. Ethical Dilemma Analysis

- Provide students with a written scenario involving an ethical dilemma in plant collection or propagation
- Students write a short essay analyzing the situation and proposing an ethical solution

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. Conservation Concept Map

- As a class, create a large concept map on the board
- Start with "Conservation through Propagation" in the center
- Students add related concepts, techniques, and applications, drawing connections between ideas

### 2. Reflection Journaling

- Students spend 5-10 minutes writing in a journal, reflecting on:
  1. One new thing they learned about conservation and propagation
  2. How they might apply this knowledge in their community
  3. Questions or areas they want to explore further

### 3. Propagation Technique Pictionary

- Divide class into teams
- One member from each team draws a propagation technique or conservation concept
- Team members guess the concept being drawn
- First team to guess correctly earns a point
