# Warm-up Activities

## Story Circle
- Students sit in a circle
- One student starts a story with a single sentence
- Each student adds one sentence to continue the story
- Continue until the story reaches a natural conclusion
- Discuss the elements that made the story interesting or engaging

## Dramatic Tableau
- Divide students into small groups
- Give each group a simple scenario (e.g., "a family argument," "a surprise party")
- Groups have 2 minutes to create a frozen tableau representing the scene
- Other groups guess the scenario and discuss the dramatic elements portrayed

# Main Lesson Activities

## Three-Act Structure Jigsaw
- Divide class into three groups: Setup, Confrontation, Resolution
- Each group researches their assigned act and its components
- Groups then mix to form new groups with one member from each act
- Students teach each other about their respective acts
- Class reconvenes to create a comprehensive overview of the three-act structure

## Timorese Folktale Analysis
- Provide students with a traditional Timorese folktale
- Guide them through identifying key dramatic elements:
  * Exposition
  * Rising action
  * Climax
  * Falling action
  * Resolution
- Discuss how these elements align with or differ from the three-act structure

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Story Element Sorting
- Provide groups with a set of cards containing various story elements
- Groups sort the elements into categories: plot, character, thought, diction, melody, spectacle
- Discuss how these elements contribute to dramatic structure

## Folktale Modernization
- Pairs choose a traditional Timorese folktale
- Collaborate to update the story to a modern setting while maintaining its core dramatic structure
- Present their modernized version to another pair, explaining their choices

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Scene Writing Challenge
- Students individually write a short scene (2-3 pages) based on a local legend
- Incorporate the dramatic structure elements learned in class
- Focus on clear exposition, rising action, and a compelling climax

## Character Arc Mapping
- Students choose a character from a well-known Timorese story
- Create a visual map of the character's arc throughout the story
- Identify key moments of change and how they relate to the overall dramatic structure

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Dramatic Structure Bingo
- Create bingo cards with dramatic structure terms and concepts
- Read out definitions or examples
- Students mark off the corresponding terms on their cards
- First to complete a row wins and explains the concepts in that row

## One-Minute Play
- Students have one minute to write a micro-play with a clear beginning, middle, and end
- Volunteers perform their plays for the class
- Discuss how even in a compressed format, dramatic structure can be maintained

## Reflection Circle
- Students form a circle and take turns sharing:
  * One new concept they learned
  * One question they still have
  * One way they plan to apply dramatic structure in their future writing
