# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Language Charades
- Students act out words or phrases in Tetum without speaking
- Other students guess the word or phrase
- Encourages non-verbal communication and vocabulary recall

## 2. Rapid-fire Code-switching
- Students form a circle
- Each student says a sentence, alternating between Tetum and Portuguese
- The sentence must connect to the previous one
- Focuses on quick language switching and story continuation

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Subtext Scenarios
- Provide students with common scenarios (e.g., a job interview, a first date)
- Students write short dialogues where characters say one thing but mean another
- Volunteers perform their dialogues, class discusses the subtext

## 2. Language Detective
- Play audio recordings of conversations with code-switching
- Students identify when and why speakers switch languages
- Discuss the effect of code-switching on the conversation's tone and meaning

## 3. Bilingual Character Building
- Students create character profiles that include language preferences
- Write short monologues for these characters, switching between languages to reveal different aspects of their personality

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Bilingual Scene Workshop
- In small groups, students collaboratively write a short bilingual scene
- Each group is assigned a specific theme (e.g., family conflict, cultural misunderstanding)
- Groups perform their scenes for the class, followed by discussion

## 2. Traditional Tale Transformation
- Groups choose a traditional Timorese story
- Collaboratively adapt the story into a modern, bilingual dialogue
- Present a staged reading of their adaptation

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Subtext Journaling
- Students write a diary entry in the voice of a character
- The entry should have a clear subtext that contradicts the surface meaning
- Encourage use of both Tetum and Portuguese to express different emotions

## 2. Code-switching Analysis
- Provide students with a transcript of a bilingual conversation
- Students annotate the transcript, explaining the purpose of each language switch
- Write a short analysis of how language choice affects the conversation's dynamics

## 3. Dialogue Rewrite
- Give students a monolingual scene (either Tetum or Portuguese)
- Students rewrite the scene, incorporating the other language
- Reflect on how the language changes alter the scene's mood and character relationships

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Bilingual Improv Circle
- Students stand in a circle
- One student starts a story in either Tetum or Portuguese
- The next student continues the story but must switch languages
- Continue around the circle, switching languages each time

## 2. Reflection Roundtable
- Students share one new insight they gained about bilingual dialogue or subtext
- Discuss how they might apply these concepts to their own writing or daily communication

## 3. Language Intention Exit Tickets
- As students leave, they write on a slip of paper:
  1. A phrase in Tetum
  2. The same phrase in Portuguese
  3. A brief explanation of how the meaning or impact changes between languages
