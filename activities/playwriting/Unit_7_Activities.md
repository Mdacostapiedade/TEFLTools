# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Space Transformation Charades (15 minutes)
- Divide the class into small groups
- Each group receives a card with a unique performance space (e.g., "beach", "marketplace", "sacred grove", "abandoned building")
- Groups have 5 minutes to prepare a short, silent scene that demonstrates the characteristics of their space
- Other groups guess the location
- Discuss how the groups used imaginary elements to convey their space

## 2. Rapid Resource Brainstorm (10 minutes)
- Students form a circle
- Instructor presents a common object (e.g., a chair, a scarf, a bucket)
- Students take turns quickly suggesting how the object could be used as a prop or set piece in different types of scenes
- Encourage creative and unconventional ideas

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Found Space Gallery Walk (20 minutes)
- Set up stations around the room with images of various non-traditional performance spaces
- Students rotate through stations in small groups, discussing:
  * Potential challenges of staging a play in each space
  * Creative opportunities presented by each location
  * How local traditions might be incorporated into a performance there
- Groups share their most interesting insights with the class

## 2. Resource-Limited Scene Analysis (25 minutes)
- Provide students with a short scene from a well-known play
- In pairs, students identify all the props, set pieces, and technical elements mentioned or implied in the scene
- Pairs then brainstorm how to stage the scene using only five physical objects
- Volunteers share their solutions, discussing the creative process

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Site-Specific Adaptation Challenge (30 minutes)
- Divide class into groups of 3-4
- Each group receives:
  * A short scene from a contemporary play
  * A card describing a specific location in Timor-Leste (e.g., a beach, a marketplace, a sacred grove)
- Groups adapt the scene to be performed in their assigned location, considering:
  * How to use natural features or found objects as set pieces
  * Where to position the audience
  * How to incorporate at least one element of traditional Timorese performance
- Groups perform their adapted scenes for the class

## 2. Community Theatre Project Planning (40 minutes)
- In the same groups, students develop a basic production plan for a community theatre project
- Provide a template with sections for:
  * Venue selection and justification
  * Required resources and potential sources
  * Community engagement strategies
  * Incorporation of local traditions
  * Potential challenges and solutions
- Groups present their plans to the class for feedback

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Personal Space Inventory (15 minutes)
- Students individually brainstorm unique performance spaces in their own communities
- For each space, they note:
  * Potential advantages for staging a play
  * Possible challenges to overcome
  * One local tradition that could be incorporated into a performance there
- Volunteers share their most interesting ideas with the class

## 2. Minimalist Scene Writing (20 minutes)
- Each student writes a short scene (2-3 minutes) that can be performed with:
  * No more than two actors
  * Three physical objects (chosen from a provided list of common items)
  * A single lighting effect (e.g., a flashlight, a candle, or natural sunlight)
- Emphasize creating impact through dialogue and movement rather than elaborate staging

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Staging Solutions Showcase (15 minutes)
- Students form a circle
- Instructor presents a series of common staging challenges (e.g., "How would you create the illusion of rain?", "How could you represent a character aging 20 years?")
- Students take turns offering quick, creative solutions using limited resources
- Encourage building on each other's ideas

## 2. Reflection and Goal Setting (10 minutes)
- Students individually write responses to:
  * One new idea about staging I learned today...
  * A challenge I want to tackle in my next theatre project...
  * A local tradition I'd like to incorporate into my work...
- Volunteers share one of their reflections with the class
- Instructor summarizes key takeaways and previews the next lesson
