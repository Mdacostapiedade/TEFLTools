# Warm-up Activities

## Poetry Style Charades
1. Divide the class into small groups.
2. Each group receives a card with a learning style (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) and a simple object (tree, sun, flower).
3. Groups have 2 minutes to prepare a representation of their object using only their assigned learning style.
4. Groups take turns presenting while others guess the object and learning style.

## Poetic Telephone
1. Students sit in a circle.
2. The first student whispers a short poem to their neighbor.
3. Each student whispers what they heard to the next person.
4. The last person recites the poem aloud.
5. Compare the final version to the original to discuss how information can be interpreted differently.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Learning Style Stations
1. Set up three stations around the room, each focusing on a different learning style.
2. Visual Station: Display various poems with accompanying images or illustrations.
3. Auditory Station: Provide recordings of poems being read aloud.
4. Kinesthetic Station: Offer tactile poetry activities (e.g., magnetic poetry, poetry puzzles).
5. Students rotate through each station, spending 5 minutes at each.

## Poem Transformation Challenge
1. Present a simple poem on the board.
2. Demonstrate how to adapt the poem for different skill levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
3. Challenge students to create their own adaptations of the poem for different abilities.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Differentiated Haiku Workshop
1. Divide students into pairs.
2. Each pair receives a simple haiku.
3. Partners work together to create three versions of the haiku:
   a) Simplified for beginners
   b) Standard version
   c) Extended/challenging version for advanced learners
4. Pairs share their adaptations with another group for feedback.

## Multi-Style Poetry Station Design
1. Form small groups of 3-4 students.
2. Each group designs a poetry activity station that incorporates:
   - A visual element
   - An auditory element
   - A kinesthetic/tactile element
3. Groups create materials and instructions for their station.
4. Class rotates through each station, experiencing the activities.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Learning Style Reflection
1. Students complete a brief learning style questionnaire.
2. They write a short reflection on their results, considering:
   - How their learning style might influence their poetry writing
   - Strategies they can use to leverage their strengths
   - Ways to improve in areas that don't align with their preferred style

## Scaffolded Poetry Prompt Creation
1. Students choose a format poem (e.g., acrostic, cinquain).
2. They create a set of three scaffolded prompts for their chosen format:
   a) A simple prompt for beginners
   b) A standard prompt for intermediate learners
   c) A challenging prompt for advanced poets
3. Students write sample poems for each of their prompts.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Poetry Style Gallery Walk
1. Display the multi-style poetry stations created during group work.
2. Students silently walk around the room, observing each station.
3. They use sticky notes to leave comments or questions on each display.
4. Conclude with a brief class discussion on the most effective or creative ideas.

## Learning Style Bingo
1. Create bingo cards with various poetry teaching strategies in the squares.
2. As you review key concepts from the lesson, students mark off corresponding strategies on their cards.
3. When a student gets "bingo," they share how they would use one of the strategies in their own teaching.

## Differentiation Dilemmas
1. Present a series of hypothetical classroom scenarios involving students with different needs or learning styles.
2. Students pair up to brainstorm solutions for each scenario.
3. Share ideas as a class, discussing the pros and cons of different approaches.
