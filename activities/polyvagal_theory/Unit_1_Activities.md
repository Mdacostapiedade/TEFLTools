# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Body Scan Check-in

- Students stand in a circle and close their eyes
- Guide them through a quick body scan, noticing areas of tension or relaxation
- Ask them to share one word describing how they feel physically or emotionally

## 2. Stress Ball Pass

- Pass around stress balls or small local objects
- Each student shares a recent stressful situation and how their body responded
- The next person squeezes the stress ball and takes a deep breath before sharing

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Autonomic State Charades

- Divide class into small groups
- Each group draws a card with a scenario triggering a specific autonomic state
- Groups act out the scenario without words
- Other students guess which autonomic state is being portrayed

## 2. Vagus Nerve Visualization

- Students lie down or sit comfortably
- Guide them through a visualization of the vagus nerve's path through the body
- Ask them to imagine the nerve "lighting up" as it connects different organs

## 3. Polyvagal Theory Living Diagram

- Assign students roles as different parts of the autonomic nervous system
- Students physically arrange themselves to represent the hierarchy of responses
- Instructor presents various scenarios, and students move to show system activation

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Cultural Safety Cues Brainstorm

- In pairs, students list Timorese cultural practices that promote feelings of safety
- Pairs join to form groups of four and compare lists
- Groups create a poster highlighting the top 5 cultural safety cues

## 2. Autonomic State Interview

- Students interview each other about their experiences with different autonomic states
- Partners take turns being the interviewer and interviewee
- Discuss how cultural factors influence their autonomic responses

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Vagal Tone Breathing Journal

- Provide students with a breathing exercise instruction card
- Students practice the exercise for 2 minutes
- They write a short reflection on how the exercise affected their state

## 2. Personal Neuroception Map

- Students draw a map of their daily environments
- They color-code areas based on how safe or threatening they feel
- Add notes on physical sensations experienced in each area

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Three-Circuit Stretch

- Guide students through three stretches, each representing a different neural circuit
- Ventral vagal: Gentle neck rolls
- Sympathetic: Quick, energizing arm shakes
- Dorsal vagal: Slow, grounding forward bend

## 2. Gratitude Circle

- Students stand in a circle
- Each person shares one thing they're grateful for learning about their nervous system
- End with a collective deep breath and gentle humming to stimulate the vagus nerve
