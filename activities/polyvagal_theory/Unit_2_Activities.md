# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Safety Scavenger Hunt (10 minutes)
- Students walk around the classroom, identifying and listing objects or features that make them feel safe
- Share findings with a partner, discussing why these elements contribute to a sense of safety

## 2. Emotion Charades (5 minutes)
- Students take turns acting out different emotional states without speaking
- Others guess the emotion and discuss which facial/body cues helped them identify it

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Neuroception Mapping (20 minutes)
- Provide students with a large outline of a human body
- In groups, students label different parts of the body with sensations associated with feeling safe or unsafe
- Discuss how these sensations relate to the autonomic nervous system

## 2. Cultural Safety Cues Gallery Walk (25 minutes)
- Set up stations around the room with images/videos of Timorese social interactions
- Students rotate through stations, noting safety cues they observe
- Class compiles a master list of Timorese-specific safety cues

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Safe Space Design Challenge (30 minutes)
- In pairs, students design a "safe space" for a specific scenario (e.g., classroom, community center)
- Use provided materials to create a model or detailed drawing
- Present designs to the class, explaining the safety cues incorporated

## 2. Social Engagement Role-Play (20 minutes)
- In groups of three, students create and perform short skits demonstrating:
  1. A socially engaging interaction
  2. An interaction lacking social engagement cues
- Observers identify specific cues present or missing in each scenario

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Personal Safety Cue Journal (15 minutes)
- Students reflect on and write about their personal safety cues
- Identify how these cues might be influenced by Timorese culture
- Consider how understanding these cues could improve daily interactions

## 2. Autonomic State Identification (10 minutes)
- Provide scenarios describing different situations
- Students identify which autonomic state (safe, fight/flight, freeze) might be activated
- Write a brief explanation for each choice

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Soothing Sense Exploration (10 minutes)
- Guide students through a sensory experience using Timorese elements:
  - Listen to traditional music
  - Touch local textiles
  - Smell familiar spices or plants
- Discuss how engaging different senses can promote feelings of safety

## 2. Neuroception Knowledge Web (15 minutes)
- As a class, create a mind map on the whiteboard connecting all the concepts learned
- Each student adds one idea or connection to the web
- Photograph the completed web for future reference
