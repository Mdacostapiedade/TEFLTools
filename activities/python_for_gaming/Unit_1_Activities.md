Here's a set of engaging activities for the "Introduction to Programming and Python" lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Introduction to Programming and Python

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### A. Human Computer
- Divide the class into pairs.
- One student is the "programmer," the other is the "computer."
- The programmer must give step-by-step instructions to guide the computer to perform a simple task (e.g., drawing a square on paper).
- Switch roles and repeat with a different task.

### B. Tech in Timor-Leste
- Show students various images of technology used in Timor-Leste (e.g., smartphones, ATMs, traffic lights).
- Ask students to brainstorm how programming might be involved in each example.

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### A. Python Installation Race
- Divide the class into small groups.
- Each group must follow the Python installation guide to install Python on their computer.
- The first group to successfully run a "Hello, World!" program wins.

### B. Python Shell Exploration
- Demonstrate basic operations in the Python shell.
- Challenge students to perform increasingly complex calculations (e.g., area of a circle, converting Celsius to Fahrenheit).
- Introduce the `print()` function and have students experiment with printing text and numbers.

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### A. Programming Concept Posters
- Assign each group a key programming concept (e.g., variables, functions, loops).
- Groups create informative posters explaining their concept and its importance in programming.
- Groups present their posters to the class.

### B. Timor-Leste Fact Generator
- In pairs, students write a simple Python program that prints three facts about Timor-Leste.
- Encourage creativity in formatting the output (e.g., using multiple `print()` statements, including ASCII art).

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### A. Personal Introduction Program
- Students write a Python program that prints their name, age, and a fun fact about themselves.
- Challenge: Include a calculation of how many days old they are.

### B. Python Syntax Debugging
- Provide students with a series of small Python programs containing syntax errors.
- Students must identify and correct the errors to make the programs run successfully.

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### A. Programming Vocabulary Bingo
- Create bingo cards with key programming terms from the lesson.
- Call out definitions, and students mark off the corresponding terms on their cards.

### B. Future of Programming in Timor-Leste
- Lead a brief class discussion on potential applications of programming in Timor-Leste's future.
- Encourage students to share their visions and ideas.

### C. One-Minute Paper
- In the last minute of class, have students write down:
  1. One thing they learned today
  2. One question they still have
- Collect the papers to inform future lessons and address any common questions.

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of the lesson while keeping students engaged and encouraging them to think about programming in the context of Timor-Leste. The mix of individual, pair, and group work caters to different learning styles and promotes collaboration.
