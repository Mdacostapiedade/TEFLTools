Here's a set of engaging activities for the Control Flow lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Control Flow Lesson

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### Simon Says with a Twist
- Play "Simon Says" with Python-themed commands
- Example commands: "Simon says print 'Hello'", "Simon says indent your next line"
- If a student follows a command without "Simon says", they're out
- Discuss how this game relates to conditional statements in programming

### Timor-Leste Fact or Fiction
- Present statements about Timor-Leste, some true and some false
- Students stand up for true statements and sit down for false ones
- Relate this to boolean expressions and if/else statements

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Interactive Code Demo
- Use a projector to demonstrate control flow concepts
- Write simple programs involving if/else statements and loops
- Encourage students to predict outcomes before running the code

### Flowchart Challenge
- Provide students with a simple problem related to Timor-Leste
- Ask them to create a flowchart showing the control flow
- Example: Determining if a year is a good coffee harvest based on rainfall

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Control Flow Puzzle
- Divide students into pairs or small groups
- Provide each group with a set of code snippets on paper
- Ask them to arrange the snippets to create a working program
- Example: A program that checks if a number is prime

### Timor-Leste Quiz Show
- Groups create a quiz show about Timor-Leste using if/else statements
- Each group presents their quiz to the class
- Other groups try to answer the questions

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Coffee Bean Counter
- Write a program that uses a for loop to count coffee beans
- The program should stop counting when it reaches a certain number or when a "rotten" bean is found

### Tetum Number Translator
- Create a program that takes a number input (1-10) and outputs the Tetum word for that number
- Use if/elif/else statements for the translation

### District Population Categorizer
- Provide a list of Timor-Leste districts and their populations
- Write a program that categorizes districts as "small", "medium", or "large" based on population thresholds

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### Control Flow Pictionary
- Students take turns drawing representations of control flow concepts
- Others guess the concept being drawn
- Examples: if/else statement, for loop, while loop

### One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute about:
  1. One thing they learned about control flow
  2. One question they still have

### Python Fortune Teller
- Create a simple "fortune teller" program using if/else statements and random number generation
- Students can add Timorese-themed fortunes

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of control flow in Python while incorporating elements relevant to Timor-Leste. They provide a mix of interactive, collaborative, and individual tasks to keep students engaged throughout the lesson.
