Here's a set of engaging activities for the Functions lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Learning Unit 4: Functions

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### Function Charades
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group acts out a daily "function" (e.g., making coffee, tying shoelaces)
- Other groups guess the function and identify inputs (parameters) and outputs (return values)

### Function Matching Game
- Create cards with function names, parameters, and return values
- Students match the cards to create complete function definitions
- Discuss the matches as a class

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Live Coding: Greeting Function
- Instructor demonstrates creating a simple greeting function
- Students suggest modifications (e.g., adding parameters, changing the greeting)
- Gradually build complexity, introducing parameters and return values

### Function Building Blocks
- Provide students with paper "blocks" representing different parts of a function (def keyword, function name, parameters, body, return statement)
- Students arrange the blocks to create valid functions
- Discuss different arrangements and their implications

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Currency Conversion Challenge
- In pairs, students create a function to convert between US dollars and Timorese centavos
- Each pair tests their function against other pairs' functions
- Discuss different approaches and optimize for accuracy and efficiency

### Timor-Leste Trivia Function
- In groups of 3-4, students create a function that asks trivia questions about Timor-Leste
- Groups exchange functions and try to answer each other's questions
- Award points for well-structured functions and correct answers

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Function Refactoring
- Provide students with a long, repetitive piece of code
- Challenge them to refactor it using functions to reduce repetition
- Compare solutions and discuss the benefits of using functions

### Create-Your-Own Math Function
- Students design and implement a math function of their choice (e.g., calculating the volume of a cone, finding the nth Fibonacci number)
- Encourage the use of parameters and return values
- Students present their functions to the class

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### Function Telephone
- Students sit in a circle
- The first student writes a simple function definition
- Each subsequent student adds one line to the function
- The last student executes the function and discusses the result

### Rapid Fire Function Quiz
- Display a series of function-related questions on the projector
- Students write their answers on mini-whiteboards
- Discuss correct answers and address any misconceptions

### Function Haiku
- Challenge students to write a haiku about functions
- Share and vote on the most creative and accurate haikus
- Display the winning haikus in the classroom

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of functions while keeping students engaged and encouraging both collaborative and individual learning. They incorporate elements of Timor-Leste culture and provide opportunities for students to apply their knowledge in practical and creative ways.
