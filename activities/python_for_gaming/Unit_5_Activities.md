Here's a set of engaging activities for the Lists and Dictionaries lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Lists and Dictionaries Lesson

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### 1.1 Real-life Collections (10 minutes)
- In pairs, students list as many real-life collections as they can think of in 2 minutes (e.g., shopping list, phone contacts, dictionary).
- Share with the class and discuss how these collections are organized and accessed.

### 1.2 Guess the Data Structure (5 minutes)
- Teacher describes a scenario, and students guess whether a list or dictionary would be more appropriate.
- Scenarios: 
  - Storing the names of Timor-Leste's districts (List)
  - Mapping district names to their populations (Dictionary)
  - Keeping track of the order of runners in a race (List)
  - Storing a person's details (name, age, occupation) (Dictionary)

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### 2.1 Interactive List Demo (15 minutes)
- Using a projector, demonstrate list operations in Python.
- Create a list of Timorese fruits.
- Show how to access, add, remove, and modify elements.
- Encourage students to suggest operations to perform on the list.

### 2.2 Dictionary Explorer (15 minutes)
- Create a dictionary of Timorese landmarks and their locations.
- Demonstrate how to access, add, and modify key-value pairs.
- Show how to iterate through keys and values.
- Let students suggest new landmarks to add or modifications to make.

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 3.1 List Challenge (20 minutes)
In pairs:
1. Create a list of the 13 municipalities of Timor-Leste.
2. Write code to:
   - Add 'Atauro' as a new municipality
   - Remove 'Oecusse' from the list
   - Sort the list alphabetically
   - Print the 3rd and 7th municipalities

### 3.2 Tetum-English Dictionary Builder (25 minutes)
In groups of 3-4:
1. Create a Tetum-English dictionary with at least 10 words.
2. Implement functions to:
   - Add a new word and its translation
   - Look up a word's translation
   - Remove a word
   - Print all words alphabetically

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### 4.1 List Manipulation (15 minutes)
Write a Python script to:
1. Create a list of the top 5 tallest mountains in Timor-Leste.
2. Add a new mountain to the list.
3. Replace the 3rd mountain with "Mount Ramelau".
4. Print the list in reverse order.
5. Find and print the index of "Mount Ramelau".

### 4.2 Coffee Production Tracker (20 minutes)
Create a dictionary to track coffee production in different regions:
1. Initialize the dictionary with at least 5 regions and their production amounts.
2. Write functions to:
   - Update the production amount for a region
   - Add a new region
   - Calculate and print the total production
   - Find and print the region with the highest production

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 5.1 Data Structure Showdown (10 minutes)
- Divide the class into two teams: Team List and Team Dictionary.
- Present a series of scenarios.
- Teams must argue why their data structure is better for each scenario.
- Class votes on the winner for each scenario.

### 5.2 One-Minute Paper (5 minutes)
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. One thing they learned about lists
  2. One thing they learned about dictionaries
  3. One question they still have
- Collect papers and address common questions or misconceptions.

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of lists and dictionaries while incorporating culturally relevant examples from Timor-Leste. They provide a mix of individual, pair, and group work to cater to different learning styles and keep students engaged throughout the lesson.
