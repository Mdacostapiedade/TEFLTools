Here's a set of engaging activities for the File I/O and Basic Data Analysis lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for File I/O and Basic Data Analysis Lesson

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### File Type Scavenger Hunt (10 minutes)
- Students work in pairs to list as many file types as they can in 2 minutes
- Class discussion on which file types are most common and why
- Quick explanation of text files and CSV files

### Real-world File I/O Examples (5 minutes)
- Show students examples of file I/O in everyday technology (e.g., saving a game progress, storing high scores, keeping a digital diary)
- Discuss how these examples relate to the lesson objectives

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Interactive File Reading Demo (10 minutes)
- Use a large display to show students how to read a text file containing Timorese proverbs
- Ask students to suggest modifications to the code to read different parts of the file

### CSV Data Exploration (15 minutes)
- Provide students with a CSV file containing data on Timorese coffee exports
- Guide them through reading the file and extracting specific information
- Demonstrate how to calculate the total coffee exports for a given year

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Coffee Production Analysis Challenge (20 minutes)
- In pairs, students work with a CSV file containing coffee production data for different regions of Timor-Leste
- Task 1: Find the region with the highest coffee production
- Task 2: Calculate the average coffee production across all regions
- Task 3: Write the results to a new CSV file

### Economic Indicator Dashboard (25 minutes)
- In groups of 3-4, students create a simple "dashboard" program that:
  1. Reads economic data from a CSV file (GDP, inflation rate, unemployment rate)
  2. Calculates year-over-year changes
  3. Prints a summary of the economic indicators
  4. Writes the summary to a new text file

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Personal Library Catalog (15 minutes)
- Students create a program that:
  1. Asks the user to input book titles and authors
  2. Writes this information to a CSV file
  3. Reads the CSV file and prints out the library catalog

### Weather Data Analysis (20 minutes)
- Provide students with a CSV file containing daily temperature data for Dili
- Students write a program to:
  1. Read the CSV file
  2. Calculate the average temperature for each month
  3. Find the hottest and coldest days of the year
  4. Write the results to a new text file

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### File I/O and Data Analysis Quiz Game (10 minutes)
- Divide the class into teams
- Ask questions about file I/O concepts and data analysis techniques covered in the lesson
- Teams earn points for correct answers

### Reflection and Real-world Applications (5 minutes)
- Students write a brief reflection on how they could use file I/O and data analysis skills in their daily lives or future careers
- Share a few examples with the class

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of file I/O and basic data analysis while keeping students engaged through relevant, Timor-Leste-focused examples and collaborative work. The mix of individual, pair, and group activities caters to different learning styles and helps maintain student interest throughout the lesson.
