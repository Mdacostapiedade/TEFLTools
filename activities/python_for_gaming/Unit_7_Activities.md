Here's a set of engaging activities for the "Introduction to Libraries and APIs" lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Introduction to Libraries and APIs

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### API Charades
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group acts out a scenario where an API might be useful (e.g., checking weather, translating languages, getting directions)
- Other groups guess what type of API is being demonstrated

### Library Brainstorm Race
- Give students 2 minutes to list as many Python libraries as they can
- Share and discuss the most common and interesting libraries mentioned

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### API Explorer
- Provide students with a list of public APIs
- Students choose one API and explore its documentation
- They share with the class what the API does and how it could be useful

### Library Installation Challenge
- Students race to correctly install a specific library using pip
- First student to successfully import the library and use a basic function wins

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Weather App Development
- In pairs, students create a simple weather app using a weather API
- One student focuses on making the API call, the other on parsing the data
- They collaborate to display the results

### Data Visualization Team Challenge
- Groups of 3-4 students are given a dataset about Timor-Leste
- They use matplotlib to create at least three different types of visualizations
- Groups present their visualizations and explain their choices

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### API Request Practice
- Students write a program that makes an API request to a currency exchange rate API
- They should retrieve the current exchange rate between USD and Timorese Centavo

### Custom Library Creation
- Students create a simple custom library with functions related to Timor-Leste
- Example functions: convert between districts and their capitals, calculate distance between two points using latitude and longitude

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### API and Library Jeopardy
- Create a Jeopardy-style game with categories like "Famous Libraries," "API Concepts," "HTTP Methods," and "JSON Basics"
- Students compete in teams to answer questions and reinforce their learning

### Real-world Application Brainstorm
- Students spend 5 minutes thinking of a real-world problem in Timor-Leste that could be solved using APIs or libraries
- They share their ideas and discuss the potential impact of these solutions

### Reflection Circle
- Form a circle and pass around an object
- When holding the object, each student shares one thing they learned about libraries or APIs and one way they could use this knowledge in the future

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of the lesson while keeping students engaged and encouraging both collaborative and individual learning. They also incorporate elements specific to Timor-Leste to make the content more relevant and applicable to the students' lives.
