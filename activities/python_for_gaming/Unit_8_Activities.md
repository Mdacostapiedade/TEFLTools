Here's a set of engaging activities for Learning Unit 8: Final Project, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Learning Unit 8: Final Project

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### a) Local Issues Brainstorm Race (15 minutes)
- Divide the class into small groups
- Each group has 5 minutes to list as many local issues in Timor-Leste as possible
- Groups then have 5 minutes to brainstorm potential Python-based solutions for these issues
- The group with the most viable ideas wins

### b) Project Inspiration Gallery Walk (20 minutes)
- Set up stations around the room with posters or laptops showcasing successful Python projects addressing social issues
- Students walk around, taking notes on project ideas that inspire them
- Conclude with a brief class discussion on the most inspiring projects

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### a) Project Management Simulation (30 minutes)
- Divide the class into "companies" of 4-5 students
- Give each company a simple project to plan (e.g., organizing a local festival)
- Introduce project management tools and techniques
- Companies create a project plan using these tools
- Present plans to the class and discuss the process

### b) MVP Feature Prioritization Exercise (25 minutes)
- Provide a list of features for a hypothetical app (e.g., a local market price tracker)
- Students individually rank features by priority
- In small groups, students discuss their rankings and agree on a final list
- Groups present their MVP feature list and explain their reasoning

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### a) Project Pitch Development (45 minutes)
- In project groups, students develop a 5-minute pitch for their final project idea
- Groups should address:
  * The problem they're solving
  * Their proposed solution
  * How Python will be used
  * Potential impact on the community
- Groups practice their pitch with another group and receive feedback

### b) User Story Mapping (30 minutes)
- Project groups create a user story map for their project
- Use sticky notes or an online tool to visualize the user journey
- Identify key features and prioritize them for the MVP
- Groups share their maps with the class and explain their thought process

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### a) Git Basics Tutorial (20 minutes)
- Students complete an online Git tutorial to learn basic version control
- Practice creating a repository, making commits, and pushing changes

### b) Project Reflection Journal (15 minutes daily)
- Students maintain a daily journal throughout the project
- Prompts include:
  * What did you accomplish today?
  * What challenges did you face?
  * What do you plan to work on next?
  * How are you feeling about the project?

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### a) Daily Stand-up Meetings (10 minutes at the end of each session)
- Project groups hold a brief stand-up meeting
- Each member shares:
  * What they accomplished
  * What they plan to do next
  * Any blockers they're facing

### b) Peer Feedback Carousel (30 minutes, periodic throughout the unit)
- Groups set up stations to showcase their work-in-progress
- Other groups rotate through the stations, leaving constructive feedback
- Conclude with a class discussion on common themes and helpful suggestions

### c) Project Showcase and Celebration (Final session)
- Groups present their final projects to the class and invited community members
- Set up a science fair-style showcase where students can demo their projects
- Invite local tech professionals or community leaders to provide feedback
- Conclude with a celebration of the students' achievements and a discussion on potential next steps for the projects

These activities are designed to engage students in the project development process, reinforce key concepts, and provide opportunities for collaboration and reflection throughout the final project unit.
