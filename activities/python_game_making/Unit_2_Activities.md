Here's a set of engaging activities for the Drawing and Animation lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Drawing and Animation Lesson

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### Shape Scavenger Hunt (10 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Show various images of Timor-Leste landmarks and tais patterns
- Have groups compete to identify and list as many basic shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) as they can find in the images
- Discuss how these shapes could be recreated using Pygame drawing functions

### Pixel Art Challenge (5 minutes)
- Provide students with graph paper
- Challenge them to create a simple pixel art version of the Timor-Leste flag or a tais pattern
- Discuss how this relates to creating digital graphics

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Shape Drawing Demonstration (15 minutes)
- Use a projector to demonstrate Pygame drawing functions
- Show how to create different shapes, change colors, and position elements on the screen
- Encourage students to follow along on their computers

### Image Loading Workshop (15 minutes)
- Demonstrate how to load and display an image in Pygame
- Guide students through the process of loading a provided image (e.g., Timor-Leste flag or tais pattern)
- Show how to resize and position the image on the screen

### Animation Basics (20 minutes)
- Explain the concept of frame-by-frame animation
- Demonstrate how to create a simple animation by moving a shape across the screen
- Show how to control animation speed using frame rate

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Collaborative Flag Recreation (20 minutes)
- In pairs, students recreate the Timor-Leste flag using Pygame drawing functions
- One student writes the code while the other provides guidance and checks for accuracy
- Pairs switch roles halfway through the task

### Animation Brainstorming (15 minutes)
- In small groups, students brainstorm ideas for animating a tais pattern
- Groups sketch out their animation concept on paper
- Each group presents their idea to the class

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Shape Drawing Challenge (15 minutes)
- Provide students with a worksheet containing various shapes and their positions
- Challenge students to recreate the shapes using Pygame drawing functions
- Encourage experimentation with colors and line thicknesses

### Image Manipulation Exercise (20 minutes)
- Give students an image of a tais pattern
- Task them with loading the image, resizing it, and displaying it in different positions on the screen
- Challenge advanced students to create a simple animation with the image (e.g., fading in/out or moving across the screen)

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### Code Gallery Walk (10 minutes)
- Have students display their work on their computer screens
- Organize a "gallery walk" where students view each other's creations
- Encourage students to leave positive feedback or questions on sticky notes

### Animation Showcase (10 minutes)
- Select a few students to demonstrate their animations to the class
- Discuss the techniques used and brainstorm ways to enhance the animations

### Reflection Circle (5 minutes)
- Form a circle with the class
- Go around the circle, having each student share:
  * One new thing they learned
  * One challenge they faced
  * One thing they're excited to try in the next lesson

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of drawing and animation in Pygame while keeping students engaged and encouraging creativity. They also incorporate cultural elements relevant to Timor-Leste to make the learning experience more meaningful and relatable for the students.
