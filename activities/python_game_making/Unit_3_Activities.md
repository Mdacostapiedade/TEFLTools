Here's a set of engaging activities for the lesson on User Input and Game Controls, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for User Input and Game Controls Lesson

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### a. Input Device Charades (5 minutes)
- Students act out different input devices (keyboard, mouse, joystick, touchscreen) without speaking.
- Others guess the device being portrayed.

### b. Quick Quiz: Input Matching (5 minutes)
- Display a list of game actions (jump, shoot, move left, etc.) on the board.
- Students match each action to a typical input (spacebar, left mouse button, left arrow key, etc.).

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### a. Event Handling Demonstration (10 minutes)
- Teacher demonstrates live coding of a simple Pygame program that detects and prints various events.
- Students observe and ask questions about different types of events.

### b. Keyboard Control Experiment (15 minutes)
- Students follow along with the teacher to create a program that moves a rectangle using arrow keys.
- Experiment with different key combinations and movement speeds.

### c. Mouse Input Exploration (15 minutes)
- Teacher guides students in modifying the previous program to also respond to mouse clicks and movement.
- Students explore how to combine keyboard and mouse input in the same program.

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### a. Input Device Design Challenge (20 minutes)
- In pairs, students design a unique game input device for a specific type of game (e.g., racing, platformer).
- They sketch their design and list what Pygame events it would generate.
- Pairs present their designs to neighboring groups.

### b. Multi-player Control Scheme (25 minutes)
- In groups of 3-4, students design a control scheme for a local multiplayer game.
- They must use a combination of keyboard and mouse inputs for multiple players.
- Groups create a simple demo showcasing their control scheme.

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### a. Character Movement Challenge (20 minutes)
- Students individually create a program that moves a character (represented by an image or shape) using arrow keys.
- The character should wrap around screen edges.
- Bonus: Implement acceleration and deceleration.

### b. Click and Collect Game (25 minutes)
- Students create a simple game where players click on randomly appearing objects to collect them.
- Implement a score counter and a time limit.
- Customize with local Timorese themed graphics.

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### a. Input Prediction Game (10 minutes)
- Teacher shows a short gameplay video of a popular game.
- Students write down their guesses for the input controls used.
- Discuss the effectiveness of different control schemes.

### b. Reflection Circle (10 minutes)
- Students form a circle and take turns sharing:
  1. One new thing they learned about game controls
  2. One challenge they faced during the lesson
  3. One idea for a game they'd like to make with their new skills

### c. Control Scheme Critique (5 minutes)
- Display images of various game controllers (including traditional and modern ones).
- Students discuss the pros and cons of each design and how they relate to Pygame inputs.

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of the lesson while keeping students engaged through a mix of individual work, collaboration, and creative challenges. They also incorporate elements relevant to the Timorese context to make the learning more relatable and interesting for the students.
