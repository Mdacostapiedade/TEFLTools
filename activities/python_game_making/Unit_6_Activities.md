Here's a set of engaging activities for the Final Project - Complete Dodger Game lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Final Project - Complete Dodger Game

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### Cultural Inspiration Brainstorm (10 minutes)
- Divide the class into small groups of 3-4 students
- Each group receives a set of cards with different Timorese cultural elements (e.g., tais patterns, traditional houses, local animals)
- Groups brainstorm how these elements could be incorporated into a Dodger game
- Share ideas with the class, creating a collective inspiration board

### Rapid Game Sketch (5 minutes)
- Students individually sketch a quick concept for their Timorese-themed Dodger game
- Include main character, objects to dodge, and background elements
- Pair up and explain their concept to a partner in 30 seconds

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Game Design Document Workshop (20 minutes)
- Provide a template for a simple game design document
- Guide students through filling out each section:
  * Game concept
  * Core mechanics
  * Visual style
  * Sound design
  * Cultural elements
- Students complete their own game design document

### Sprite Creation Station (30 minutes)
- Set up different stations with computers and image editing software
- Students rotate through stations to create:
  1. Player character sprite
  2. Objects to dodge
  3. Background elements
  4. UI elements (score display, health bar, etc.)
- Encourage use of Timorese cultural elements in designs

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Code Review Pairs (20 minutes)
- Students pair up and review each other's code
- Provide a checklist of key elements to look for:
  * Game loop structure
  * Player movement
  * Object generation and movement
  * Collision detection
  * Scoring system
- Partners offer suggestions for improvement and debug together

### Playtesting Circles (25 minutes)
- Form groups of 4-5 students
- Each student takes turns presenting their game to the group
- Group members play the game and provide constructive feedback
- Rotate until all group members have presented

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Debug Challenge (15 minutes)
- Provide students with a partially complete Dodger game code with intentional bugs
- Students work individually to identify and fix the bugs
- Offer hints for particularly tricky bugs

### Game Balancing Exercise (20 minutes)
- Students fine-tune their game's difficulty curve
- Experiment with different parameters:
  * Speed of falling objects
  * Frequency of object generation
  * Player movement speed
  * Scoring system
- Test and adjust until the game feels challenging but fair

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### One-Minute Game Pitch (10 minutes)
- Students prepare a one-minute pitch for their game
- Include unique features, cultural elements, and target audience
- Deliver pitches to the class in rapid succession

### Reflection Journal (5 minutes)
- Students write a brief reflection on their game development process
- Prompt questions:
  * What was the most challenging aspect of creating your game?
  * How did you incorporate Timorese culture into your game?
  * What would you do differently if you started over?

### Peer Appreciation Circle (10 minutes)
- Form a large circle with the entire class
- Each student shares one thing they admired about another student's game or process
- Encourage specific, constructive praise

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of the lesson while keeping students engaged and encouraging creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking. They also incorporate cultural elements and provide opportunities for both individual work and peer interaction.
