### A. Conditional Statements Coding Along (15 minutes)
- Instructor demonstrates writing a program that determines the season based on the month input.
- Students code along, asking questions and suggesting modifications.

### B. Loop Visualization (10 minutes)
- Use a physical demonstration to visualize loops.
- Students form a circle and pass an object, each student representing an iteration of the loop.
- Demonstrate both for and while loops.

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### A. Conditional Statements Challenge (20 minutes)
- In pairs, students create a program that recommends activities based on weather conditions in Timor-Leste.
- Example: If it's raining, suggest indoor activities; if it's sunny, suggest outdoor activities.

### B. Loop Treasure Hunt (25 minutes)

- The game should ask the player to make choices and use a loop to continue until the treasure is found or the game ends.

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### A. Conditional Statements Workout (15 minutes)
- Students individually complete a worksheet with various scenarios requiring if/elif/else statements.
- Examples: Grading system, traffic light simulator, simple calculator.

### B. Loop Challenge (20 minutes)
- Students write programs to solve the following tasks:
  1. Print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
  2. Create a simple guessing game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100.

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### A. Control Flow Pictionary (10 minutes)
- Students take turns drawing representations of control flow concepts (if statements, loops) on the board.
- Other students guess the concept being illustrated.

### B. Reflection and Sharing (5 minutes)
- Students write a brief reflection on what they found most challenging or interesting about control flow.
- Volunteers share their reflections with the class.

### C. Exit Ticket (5 minutes)
- Students complete a quick quiz with 3-5 multiple choice questions about the key concepts covered in the lesson.
- Review the answers as a class to reinforce learning and clear up any misconceptions.

These activities are designed to engage students, reinforce the key concepts of control flow, and provide opportunities for both collaborative and individual learning. They also incorporate elements relevant to Timor-Leste to make the content more relatable and interesting for local students.
