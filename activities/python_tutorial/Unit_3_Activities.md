Here's a set of engaging activities for the Functions and Modules lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Functions and Modules Lesson

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### Function Charades (10 minutes)
- Divide the class into small groups.
- Each group receives a card with a daily task (e.g., "make coffee", "wash clothes").
- Groups act out the task as a series of steps.
- Other groups guess the task and identify the "parameters" (inputs) and "return value" (output).

### Module Memory Game (5 minutes)
- Create cards with Python module names on one side and their purposes on the other.
- Students play a memory game, matching modules to their purposes.
- Include modules like `math`, `random`, `datetime`, and `os`.

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Function Factory (20 minutes)
- Students create simple functions based on real-life scenarios in Timor-Leste:
  1. A function to calculate the cost of a tais based on size and complexity.
  2. A function to determine the amount of rice needed for a family gathering based on the number of guests.
- Demonstrate how to define parameters and return values.

### Module Explorer (15 minutes)
- Introduce students to the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).
- Guide them through importing different modules (`math`, `random`, `datetime`).
- Challenge students to discover and use three functions from each module.

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Timor-Leste Travel Planner (30 minutes)
- In pairs, students create a set of functions to plan a trip around Timor-Leste:
  1. A function to calculate travel time between cities based on distance and mode of transport.
  2. A function to recommend activities based on the destination.
  3. A function to estimate daily expenses based on the city and accommodation type.
- Pairs then combine their functions into a simple travel planning program.

### Custom Module Creation (25 minutes)
- In groups of 3-4, students create a `timor_leste` module with functions related to the country:
  1. A function to convert between USD and Timorese centavos.
  2. A function to provide information about Timorese districts.
  3. A function to calculate the coffee harvest yield based on farm size and weather conditions.
- Groups share their modules and use functions from other groups' modules.

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Function Refactoring (15 minutes)
- Provide students with a long, repetitive piece of code related to Timorese coffee production.
- Challenge them to refactor the code by creating appropriate functions to reduce repetition and improve readability.

### Module Mastery (20 minutes)
- Students complete a worksheet with tasks requiring the use of various Python modules:
  1. Use the `random` module to simulate a traditional Timorese game.
  2. Use the `datetime` module to calculate ages based on important dates in Timor-Leste's history.
  3. Use the `math` module to solve geometry problems related to traditional Timorese architecture.

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### Function Telephone (10 minutes)
- Students sit in a circle.
- The first student writes a simple function definition.
- The next student writes a function call for that function.
- Continue around the circle, alternating between definitions and calls.
- Discuss the final result as a class.

### Module Mind Map (5 minutes)
- As a class, create a mind map on the board showing:
  1. Built-in Python modules discussed in class.
  2. Functions within those modules.
  3. Potential uses for these modules in Timorese context.
- Use this as a visual summary of the lesson.

These activities are designed to reinforce the concepts of functions and modules while keeping the content relevant and engaging for students in Timor-Leste. They provide a mix of individual, pair, and group work, as well as opportunities for creativity and practical application.
