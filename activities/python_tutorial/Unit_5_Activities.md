Here's a set of engaging activities for the File Handling and Exception Handling lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for File Handling and Exception Handling Lesson

## Warm-up Activities

1. **File Handling Charades**: 
   - Divide students into small groups.
   - Each group acts out a file operation (e.g., opening a file, writing to a file, closing a file) without speaking.
   - Other groups guess the operation being performed.

2. **Exception Matching Game**:
   - Create cards with exception names and their descriptions.
   - Students work in pairs to match the exceptions with their correct descriptions.

## Main Lesson Activities

1. **Interactive File Explorer**:
   - Use a projector to demonstrate file operations in real-time.
   - Ask students to suggest file names, content, and operations to perform.
   - Implement their suggestions and show the results immediately.

2. **Exception Handling Roleplay**:
   - Assign roles to students: "Program", "User", and various "Exceptions".
   - The "Program" tries to perform tasks while "Exceptions" interrupt.
   - The "User" provides inputs, and the class discusses how to handle each situation.

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

1. **CSV Data Analysis Challenge**:
   - Provide groups with a CSV file containing Timor-Leste's crop production data.
   - Challenge them to write a program that:
     * Reads the CSV file
     * Calculates the total production for each crop
     * Identifies the top 3 producing regions
     * Writes results to a new file
   - Groups present their solutions and discuss different approaches.

2. **Error-Handling Improvement Workshop**:
   - Give pairs an intentionally error-prone program related to Timor-Leste (e.g., a tourism information system).
   - Task them with identifying potential errors and implementing appropriate exception handling.
   - Pairs swap programs and test each other's error handling.

## Individual Practice Exercises

1. **Recipe File Manager**:
   - Students create a program that:
     * Reads a file of Timorese recipes
     * Allows adding new recipes
     * Implements error handling for file operations and user input
     * Writes updated recipes back to the file

2. **Data Validation Challenge**:
   - Provide a text file with mixed data (numbers, strings, dates) about Timor-Leste's districts.
   - Students write a program to read the file, validate data types, and handle exceptions for incorrect data.

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

1. **Exception Handling Bingo**:
   - Create bingo cards with various exceptions and file handling concepts.
   - Call out scenarios or code snippets.
   - Students mark off the corresponding exception or concept on their card.

2. **File Handling and Exception Handling Reflection**:
   - Students write a brief reflection on:
     * How file handling could be useful in their daily lives or future careers
     * Real-world scenarios in Timor-Leste where exception handling is crucial
   - Volunteers share their reflections with the class.

3. **Concept Map Creation**:
   - In small groups, students create a concept map linking the main ideas from the lesson.
   - Groups present their maps, explaining the connections between concepts.

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of file handling and exception handling while keeping students engaged and relating the content to the Timor-Leste context.
