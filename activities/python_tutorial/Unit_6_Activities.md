Here's a set of engaging activities for the Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming lesson, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

## Warm-up Activities

1. **Object Brainstorm** (5 minutes)
   - In pairs, students list as many objects as they can think of in a Timorese market.
   - For each object, they note down at least one attribute and one action.

2. **Real-world Class Diagram** (10 minutes)
   - As a class, create a simple UML diagram on the board for a familiar object (e.g., a tais loom).
   - Discuss attributes (e.g., size, material) and methods (e.g., weave(), adjustTension()).

## Main Lesson Activities

1. **Interactive Class Creation** (15 minutes)
   - Using student input, build a `Coffee` class on the projector.
   - Ask students to suggest attributes and methods.
   - Implement the class in Python, explaining each step.

2. **Method Madness** (10 minutes)
   - Provide students with a pre-written `UmaLulik` class.
   - Challenge them to add three new methods to the class in 5 minutes.
   - Discuss the most creative and useful additions.

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

1. **OOP Scavenger Hunt** (20 minutes)
   - In groups of 3-4, students receive a list of OOP concepts (e.g., class, object, method).
   - They must find real-world examples of each concept around the classroom or school.
   - Groups present their findings, explaining how each example relates to OOP.

2. **Design a Timorese Game Class** (25 minutes)
   - In pairs, students design a class for a traditional Timorese game (e.g., Bola Beikala).
   - They must include at least 3 attributes and 3 methods.
   - Pairs exchange designs and provide feedback.

## Individual Practice Exercises

1. **Code Completion Challenge** (15 minutes)
   - Provide students with a partially completed `Student` class.
   - Students must fill in the missing parts (e.g., constructor, methods).
   - Bonus points for adding extra functionality.

2. **Create a `TaisPattern` Class** (20 minutes)
   - Students individually create a class to represent different tais patterns.
   - The class should include attributes like colors, motifs, and region of origin.
   - Implement methods to describe the pattern and estimate production time.

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

1. **OOP Concept Map** (10 minutes)
   - Students create a concept map linking the main OOP concepts learned.
   - They should include examples from the lesson for each concept.

2. **Real-world OOP Applications** (5 minutes)
   - In a quick-fire round, students suggest potential applications of OOP in Timor-Leste.
   - Discuss how these applications could benefit local communities or businesses.

3. **One-minute Paper** (5 minutes)
   - Students write a one-minute response to: "How could OOP help solve a problem in your community?"
   - Volunteers share their ideas with the class.

These activities are designed to reinforce the key concepts of object-oriented programming while making the learning experience engaging and relevant to the Timorese context. They provide a mix of individual, pair, and group work to cater to different learning styles and maintain student interest throughout the lesson.
