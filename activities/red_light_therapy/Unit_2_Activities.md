# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Light Therapy Scavenger Hunt

- Students search the classroom for hidden cards with light therapy-related terms or concepts.
- In pairs, they discuss and explain the terms they found to each other.

## 2. Mitochondria Analogy Game

- Students brainstorm analogies for mitochondria (e.g., "powerhouse of the cell").
- Share and vote on the most creative and accurate analogies.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Cellular Light Show

- Use a darkened room and colored flashlights to demonstrate how different wavelengths of light interact with a large-scale cell model.
- Students take turns "activating" different cellular components with the appropriate light color.

## 2. ATP Production Simulation

- Students role-play as different components of the electron transport chain.
- Use yarn or string to represent electron flow, with and without the influence of red/near-infrared light.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Photobiomodulation Puzzle

- In small groups, students assemble a large puzzle representing the cellular mechanisms of light therapy.
- Each puzzle piece contains a key concept or process.

## 2. Light Therapy Device Design Challenge

- Pairs design a hypothetical light therapy device tailored for a specific health issue in Timor-Leste.
- Groups present their designs, explaining the rationale behind their choices.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Cellular Response Flowchart

- Students create a flowchart illustrating the sequence of cellular responses to red and near-infrared light therapy.
- Include key molecules, processes, and outcomes.

## 2. Light Therapy Journal

- Students maintain a journal throughout the lesson, noting key concepts, questions, and potential applications.
- Encourage them to draw connections between new information and their existing knowledge.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Three-Two-One Reflection

- Students write down:
  - Three new things they learned
  - Two questions they still have
  - One way they could apply this knowledge in Timor-Leste

## 2. Light Therapy Pictionary

- In teams, students take turns drawing light therapy concepts while others guess.
- Use a timer to add excitement and reinforce quick recall of key terms.
