# Warm-up Activities

## Light Therapy Pictionary
1. Divide the class into small teams.
2. Each team sends one member to draw a light therapy-related term or concept.
3. The team has 60 seconds to guess the term while their teammate draws.
4. Rotate through teams, with each correct guess earning a point.

## Dosing Factor Brainstorm Race
1. Split the class into groups of 3-4 students.
2. Give each group a large sheet of paper and markers.
3. Set a timer for 2 minutes.
4. Groups race to list as many factors as they can think of that might affect light therapy dosing.
5. Compare lists and discuss as a class.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Interactive Dosing Calculator
1. Provide students with a simple online or spreadsheet-based dosing calculator.
2. Present various scenarios (e.g., treating acne, muscle pain, wound healing).
3. Students input different parameters (power density, time) to see how they affect the total dose.
4. Discuss the results and optimal ranges for different applications.

## Biphasic Dose Response Demonstration
1. Use a visual aid (graph or animation) to show the biphasic dose response curve.
2. Provide students with sticky notes representing "treatment effects."
3. Have students place their notes along the curve to represent different outcomes.
4. Discuss the implications of under-dosing and over-dosing.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Treatment Protocol Design Challenge
1. Divide the class into pairs or small groups.
2. Assign each group a specific health condition relevant to Timor-Leste.
3. Groups research and design a complete treatment protocol, including all necessary parameters.
4. Each group presents their protocol to the class for feedback and discussion.

## Case Study Analysis
1. Provide groups with case studies of ineffective light therapy treatments.
2. Groups analyze the cases, determining if the dose was too low or too high.
3. They propose improvements to the treatment protocol.
4. Groups share their findings and reasoning with the class.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Dosing Calculation Worksheet
1. Provide a worksheet with various light therapy scenarios.
2. Students individually calculate the optimal dose for each scenario.
3. Include questions about adjusting parameters for different skin types or conditions.

## Protocol Adaptation Exercise
1. Give students a standard light therapy protocol for a specific condition.
2. Ask them to adapt the protocol for a patient with darker skin, considering penetration depth.
3. Students write a brief explanation of their adjustments and reasoning.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Light Therapy Jeopardy
1. Create a Jeopardy-style game board with categories related to the lesson content.
2. Divide the class into teams.
3. Teams take turns choosing categories and answering questions.
4. Award points for correct answers and discuss any misconceptions.

## One-Minute Paper
1. In the last few minutes of class, ask students to write a brief response to two questions:
   - What was the most important thing you learned today?
   - What question do you still have about light therapy dosing?
2. Collect the papers and address common questions or misconceptions in the next class.

## Dosing Scenario Speed Round
1. Prepare a set of quick dosing scenarios on cards.
2. Students form a circle.
3. Pass a light therapy device (or a prop representing one) around the circle.
4. When the music stops, the student holding the device draws a card and quickly describes how they would approach dosing for that scenario.
5. Continue for several rounds to reinforce key concepts.
