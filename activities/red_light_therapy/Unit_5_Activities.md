# Warm-up Activities

## Light Therapy Device Scavenger Hunt
1. Hide various light therapy devices around the classroom
2. Divide students into teams
3. Give teams 5 minutes to find and collect as many devices as possible
4. Have teams present their findings, describing unique features of each device

## Wavelength Matching Game
1. Prepare cards with different wavelengths and their corresponding colors
2. Distribute cards randomly to students
3. Have students move around the room to find their "wavelength partner"
4. Pairs discuss potential applications of their assigned wavelength in light therapy

# Main Lesson Activities

## Device Comparison Carousel
1. Set up stations around the room, each with a different light therapy device
2. Divide students into groups and assign each to a starting station
3. Groups spend 5 minutes at each station, examining the device and recording observations
4. Rotate groups until all stations have been visited
5. Facilitate a class discussion on the pros and cons of each device

## Specification Sheet Analysis
1. Provide students with specification sheets for various light therapy devices
2. Guide students through interpreting key information (power output, wavelength, treatment area)
3. Have students create a comparison chart for the devices
4. Discuss how different specifications impact device selection for various applications

## Virtual Clinic Simulation
1. Create a virtual clinic scenario with patient cases relevant to Timor-Leste
2. Students work in small groups to select appropriate devices and develop treatment plans
3. Groups present their recommendations to the class, justifying their choices
4. Class provides feedback and discusses alternative approaches

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Device Selection Guide Creation
1. Assign each group a specific healthcare setting in Timor-Leste (e.g., rural clinic, urban hospital)
2. Groups research and develop a guide for selecting and maintaining light therapy devices for their setting
3. Include recommendations for specific devices, usage guidelines, and maintenance procedures
4. Groups create a poster or digital presentation to share their guide with the class

## Treatment Protocol Development
1. Provide pairs with a common health condition in Timor-Leste
2. Pairs research and develop a light therapy treatment protocol for the condition
3. Include device selection, dosing parameters, treatment frequency, and safety considerations
4. Pairs exchange protocols with another team for peer review and feedback

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Device Specification Worksheet
1. Provide students with a worksheet containing various light therapy device specifications
2. Students answer questions about power density calculations, treatment times, and device suitability for different scenarios
3. Include a section for students to recommend devices for specific health conditions, justifying their choices

## Safety Checklist Creation
1. Students individually create a comprehensive safety checklist for using light therapy devices
2. Include pre-treatment assessments, contraindications, eye protection, and post-treatment care
3. Students adapt their checklist to address specific concerns relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., climate, cultural considerations)

## Maintenance Schedule Design
1. Assign each student a specific light therapy device
2. Students research and create a detailed maintenance schedule for their device
3. Include daily, weekly, and monthly tasks, as well as troubleshooting guidelines
4. Students consider how Timor-Leste's climate and infrastructure might affect maintenance needs

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Light Therapy Myth Busters
1. Present a series of statements about light therapy (some true, some false)
2. Students use what they've learned to determine which statements are myths
3. Discuss each statement as a class, clarifying any misconceptions

## Timor-Leste Implementation Brainstorm
1. Divide the class into small groups
2. Each group brainstorms ideas for implementing light therapy in various sectors of Timorese society (healthcare, agriculture, education)
3. Groups share their most innovative ideas with the class
4. Conduct a brief discussion on the feasibility and potential impact of these ideas

## Reflection Journal
1. Provide students with prompts related to the lesson content
2. Students spend 5-10 minutes writing reflections on what they've learned and how it applies to their future practice
3. Encourage students to note any remaining questions or areas they'd like to explore further
