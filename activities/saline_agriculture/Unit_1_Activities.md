- Ask students to work in pairs to identify differences
- Discuss observations as a class, introducing the concept of soil salinity

### b. Salinity Guessing Game (5 minutes)
- Present various water samples with different salinity levels
- Have students taste (using disposable spoons) and rank them from least to most salty
- Relate this to soil salinity and its effects on plants

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### a. Interactive Presentation (30 minutes)
- Use a multimedia presentation with videos and infographics to explain saline agriculture concepts
- Incorporate frequent check-in questions to ensure student engagement and understanding

### b. Soil Salinity Testing Demonstration (15 minutes)
- Demonstrate how to use soil testing kits
- Explain the significance of electrical conductivity (EC) readings
- Show how to interpret results and relate them to crop suitability

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### a. Community Challenge Mapping (20 minutes)
- Divide class into groups of 3-4
- Provide large sheets of paper and markers
- Groups create mind maps of agricultural challenges in their communities
- Groups present their maps, focusing on salinity-related issues

### b. Saline Agriculture Benefits Carousel (25 minutes)
- Set up 4 stations around the room, each focusing on a benefit of saline agriculture (e.g., food security, economic opportunities, environmental benefits, land reclamation)
- Groups rotate through stations, discussing and noting ideas
- Each group presents on one benefit to the class

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### a. Soil Sample Analysis (15 minutes)
- Provide each student with a soil sample and testing kit
- Students conduct salinity tests and record results
- They then recommend suitable crops based on their findings

### b. Vocabulary Application (10 minutes)
- Give students a worksheet with fill-in-the-blank sentences using key vocabulary
- Students complete the sentences and share with a partner

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### a. 3-2-1 Reflection (10 minutes)
- Students write down:
  * 3 things they learned
  * 2 things they found interesting
  * 1 question they still have
- Discuss responses as a class

### b. Saline Agriculture Pictionary (15 minutes)
- Divide class into two teams
- Students take turns drawing concepts related to saline agriculture
- Teams guess the concept within a time limit
- This game reinforces vocabulary and key concepts in a fun way

These activities are designed to be engaging, interactive, and reinforce the key concepts of the Introduction to Saline Agriculture lesson. They cater to different learning styles and encourage both individual and collaborative learning.
