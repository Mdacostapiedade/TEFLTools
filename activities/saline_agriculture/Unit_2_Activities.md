# Engaging Activities for Salt-Tolerant Crops Lesson

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### Salt-Tolerant Plant Guessing Game (10 minutes)
- Display various plant images on a board or screen
- Have students guess which plants they think are salt-tolerant
- Discuss their reasoning and reveal the correct answers

### Saline Soil Sensation (5 minutes)
- Pass around small containers of saline and non-saline soil samples
- Ask students to feel the texture and observe any visible differences
- Discuss their observations and link to the importance of salt-tolerant crops

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Salt-Tolerant Crop Jigsaw (30 minutes)
- Divide the class into expert groups, each assigned a specific salt-tolerant crop
- Have groups research their crop and become "experts"
- Regroup students into mixed groups to share their expert knowledge
- Each student teaches others about their assigned crop

### Virtual Field Trip (20 minutes)
- Use a projector to show a virtual tour of successful salt-tolerant crop farms
- Pause at key points for discussion and questions
- Have students take notes on adaptation techniques observed

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Crop Adaptation Challenge (25 minutes)
- In pairs or small groups, assign a salt-tolerant crop and a specific region in Timor-Leste
- Challenge groups to develop an adaptation plan for their crop in that region
- Groups present their plans to the class for feedback

### Salt-Tolerant Crop Poster Creation (30 minutes)
- In groups, create informative posters about a specific salt-tolerant crop
- Include information on characteristics, cultivation, and benefits
- Display posters around the classroom for a gallery walk

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Crop Rotation Planning (20 minutes)
- Provide students with a worksheet to plan a 3-year crop rotation
- Include a list of salt-tolerant crops and their characteristics
- Students create individual plans and explain their reasoning

### Salt Tolerance Spectrum (15 minutes)
- Give students a list of various crops (both salt-tolerant and non-tolerant)
- Have them create a spectrum, placing crops from least to most salt-tolerant
- Students justify their placements based on learned information

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### Salt-Tolerant Crop Bingo (10 minutes)
- Create bingo cards with salt-tolerant crop names and characteristics
- Call out descriptions or facts about the crops
- Students mark off matching items on their cards

### One-Minute Paper (5 minutes)
- Ask students to write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have about salt-tolerant crops
- Collect papers to assess understanding and address remaining questions

### Crop Benefits Brainstorm (10 minutes)
- As a class, create a mind map on the board
- Center the map on "Benefits of Salt-Tolerant Crops"
- Have students contribute ideas, connecting economic, environmental, and social benefits

These activities are designed to reinforce key concepts, encourage active participation, and cater to different learning styles while maintaining engagement throughout the lesson on salt-tolerant crops for Timor-Leste.
