# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Modern Revival Brainstorm (5 minutes)
- In small groups, students brainstorm examples of ancient practices that have been revived in modern times (e.g., yoga, meditation, herbal medicine).
- Groups share their lists with the class, discussing why these practices have seen a resurgence.

## 2. Authenticity Spectrum (10 minutes)
- Create a line across the classroom representing a spectrum from "completely authentic" to "completely inauthentic."
- Read out scenarios related to modern seidr practices, and have students physically position themselves on the spectrum based on their opinion.
- Discuss the reasoning behind students' choices.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Seidr Revival Timeline (20 minutes)
- Provide students with cards containing key events, figures, and publications in the modern seidr revival.
- In groups, students arrange the cards chronologically on a large timeline.
- Discuss the progression and key turning points in the revival movement.

## 2. Adaptation Analysis (25 minutes)
- Present students with descriptions of traditional seidr practices and their modern adaptations.
- In pairs, students compare and contrast the traditional and modern versions, identifying reasons for changes and potential issues.
- Class discussion on the necessity and challenges of adaptation.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Practitioner Profile (30 minutes)
- Assign each group a prominent figure in modern seidr (e.g., Diana Paxson, Freya Aswynn).
- Groups research their assigned figure's background, contributions, and any controversies.
- Create a "practitioner profile" poster to present to the class.

## 2. Debate Preparation (20 minutes)
- Divide the class into two groups: one supporting the authenticity of modern seidr practices, the other critiquing them.
- Groups collaborate to develop arguments and gather evidence for their position.
- Conduct a structured debate, with time for rebuttals and audience questions.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Reflection Journal (15 minutes)
- Students write a personal reflection on the challenges of reviving ancient practices in the modern world.
- Prompt: "If you were to revive an ancient practice from your own culture, what challenges would you face, and how would you address them?"

## 2. Case Study Analysis (20 minutes)
- Provide students with a case study of a controversial modern seidr practice or practitioner.
- Students individually analyze the case, identifying key issues related to authenticity and cultural appropriation.
- Write a brief response outlining their perspective on the case.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Concept Map Creation (10 minutes)
- Individually or in pairs, students create a concept map linking key terms and ideas from the lesson (e.g., neo-shamanism, cultural appropriation, adaptation).
- Share and compare maps with nearby classmates.

## 2. Exit Ticket (5 minutes)
- Students write on an index card:
  1. One thing they learned about modern seidr revival
  2. One question they still have
  3. Their current stance on the authenticity debate (using a 1-5 scale)
- Collect cards to inform future lessons and discussions.
