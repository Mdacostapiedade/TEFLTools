# Warm-up Activities

## Cultural Connection Web

- Students stand in a circle and toss a ball of yarn to each other.
- Each student shares a spiritual or traditional practice from their culture that could address a modern issue.
- As they share, they hold onto the yarn and toss the ball to another student.
- The result is a web of connections, visually representing the interconnectedness of cultural practices.

## Shamanic Charades

- Students are given cards with different shamanic practices or concepts.
- They must act out the practice or concept without speaking while their classmates guess.
- This activity introduces key terms and concepts in a fun, interactive way.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Comparative Analysis Gallery Walk

- Create stations around the room, each representing a different shamanic tradition.
- Students move from station to station, noting similarities and differences with seidr.
- They use sticky notes to add observations to each station.
- Conclude with a class discussion on common themes and unique aspects of seidr.

## Contemporary Issues Mind Map

- Using a digital mind mapping tool or large paper, create a class mind map.
- Start with "Contemporary Issues" in the center.
- Branch out to different categories (e.g., environmental, social, personal).
- Students add specific issues and potential shamanic principles that could address them.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Shamanic Tradition Comparison Poster

- In small groups, students create a poster comparing seidr to an assigned shamanic tradition.
- The poster should include:
  - Key practices and beliefs
  - Historical and cultural contexts
  - Visual representations of important symbols or concepts
  - A section on contemporary relevance

## Debate: Ancient Wisdom vs. Modern Solutions

- Divide the class into two groups.
- One group argues for the relevance of ancient spiritual practices in solving modern issues.
- The other group argues for purely modern, scientific approaches.
- After the debate, discuss how both perspectives might be integrated.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Reflective Journal Entry

- Students write a personal reflection on how principles from seidr or their own cultural traditions might apply to a challenge in their life.
- Encourage them to consider both potential benefits and limitations of this approach.

## Create a Modern Seidr-Inspired Ritual

- Students design a non-appropriative ritual inspired by seidr principles to address a contemporary issue.
- They must explain the symbolism and intended effects of each element of the ritual.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Wisdom Wall

- On a large sheet of paper or digital whiteboard, create a "Wisdom Wall."
- Students add key insights they've gained from the lesson, written on sticky notes or digital tags.
- Discuss common themes and surprising insights as a class.

## One-Minute Paper

- In the last minute of class, students write down:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
- Collect these papers to inform future lessons and address lingering questions.
