# Warm-up Activities

## Vocal Exploration
- Students make various sounds (e.g., sirens, lip trills, humming) while feeling their larynx
- Discuss sensations and observations as a class

## Mirror Breathing
- In pairs, students face each other and synchronize their breathing
- One student leads, the other mirrors, then switch roles

# Main Lesson Activities

## Larynx Model Building
- Using clay or play-dough, students create 3D models of the larynx
- Label key structures with toothpick flags

## Respiratory System Balloon Demo
- Students inflate balloons to represent lung capacity
- Measure and compare balloon sizes, discussing factors affecting lung capacity

## Timorese Vocal Health Practices Jigsaw
- Divide class into groups, each researching a different traditional practice
- Groups teach their practice to the rest of the class

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Anatomy Puzzle Race
- In pairs, students race to correctly assemble a disassembled diagram of the vocal apparatus

## Breath Support Challenge
- Groups compete to sustain a note for the longest time using proper breath support
- Other group members provide feedback on posture and technique

## Cultural Practice Debate
- Divide class into groups to debate the effectiveness of various Timorese vocal health practices

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Diaphragmatic Breathing Journal
- Students practice diaphragmatic breathing for 5 minutes, recording observations in a journal

## Laryngeal Palpation Self-Study
- Using a hand mirror, students observe and feel their own larynx while producing different sounds

## Vocal Fold Vibration Visualization
- Students draw or paint their interpretation of vocal fold vibration based on lesson content

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Vocal Anatomy Pictionary
- Students take turns drawing anatomical structures while others guess

## Breathing Meditation
- Guided breathing exercise focusing on the structures learned in the lesson

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write a one-minute summary of the most important thing they learned in the lesson

## Vocal Health Pledge
- Students create and sign personal pledges to maintain good vocal health practices
