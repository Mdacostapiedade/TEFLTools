# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Balloon Breath

- Students inflate balloons slowly, focusing on engaging their diaphragm
- Practice releasing air steadily to create a consistent sound from the balloon
- Discuss how this relates to breath control in singing

## 2. Mirror Breathing

- In pairs, students face each other
- One student leads breathing patterns, the other mirrors
- Switch roles after 2 minutes
- Emphasize visual cues of proper diaphragmatic breathing

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Breath Visualization

- Students lie on the floor with a small book on their abdomen
- Practice breathing to make the book rise and fall smoothly
- Gradually increase the weight (add more books) to strengthen breathing muscles

## 2. Candle Flame Control

- Set up (electric) candles at varying distances
- Students practice controlling their breath to make the flame flicker without extinguishing it
- Increase distance for more challenge

## 3. Phrase Mapping

- Analyze breath marks in a written Timorese folk song
- Students mark where they would naturally breathe
- Compare and discuss differences in breath placement

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Breathing Choir

- Divide class into three groups
- Assign each group a different note length (short, medium, long)
- Conduct the "breathing choir" to create rhythmic patterns
- Focus on consistent breath support for each note length

## 2. Timorese Rhythm Breathing

- In small groups, students create breathing patterns to match traditional Timorese rhythms
- Groups perform their patterns for the class
- Class discusses how breath patterns relate to musical phrasing in Timorese music

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Straw Phonation

- Students hum through a straw into a cup of water
- Focus on creating consistent bubbles through breath control
- Gradually increase the duration of the hum

## 2. Sustained Tone Challenge

- Students sing a comfortable pitch, focusing on maintaining consistent breath support
- Use a timer to track duration
- Students log their progress and set personal goals for improvement

## 3. Timorese Lullaby Breath Mapping

- Provide sheet music for a Timorese lullaby
- Students mark breath points and practice singing with proper breath support
- Record and self-evaluate performance

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Breath Support Reflection

- Students write a brief reflection on how improved breath support has affected their singing
- Share one key insight with a partner

## 2. Relaxation Breathing

- Guide students through a series of deep, relaxing breaths
- Incorporate gentle stretches to release any tension built up during the lesson

## 3. Breathing Affirmations

- As a class, create short, positive affirmations about breath support
- Students choose one affirmation to focus on until the next lesson
- Example: "My breath flows freely and supports my voice"
