# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Resonance Exploration
- Students hum a simple melody while experimenting with different mouth shapes
- Change from 'ng' to 'ah' to 'oh' to 'ee' sounds, noting the shift in resonance

## 2. Mirror Work
- In pairs, students observe each other's facial movements during vowel production
- Focus on lip, jaw, and tongue positions for different vowels

## 3. Resonator Activation
- Students gently tap different parts of their face and chest while sustaining a note
- Identify which areas produce the most vibration for different pitches

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Resonance Mapping
- Using diagrams of the vocal tract, students color-code areas of resonance for different vowel sounds
- Discuss how changes in the vocal tract shape affect tone quality

## 2. Formant Frequency Game
- Play audio samples of isolated formants
- Students guess which vowel sound each formant represents

## 3. Timorese Tone Analysis
- Listen to recordings of traditional Timorese singers
- Identify and describe unique resonance qualities in their voices

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Resonance Sculpture
- In pairs, one student produces a sustained vowel
- The partner gently manipulates the singer's facial muscles to alter resonance
- Switch roles and discuss the changes in sound

## 2. Vowel Modification Chain
- In groups of 4-5, each student starts with a different vowel sound
- Students take turns modifying their vowel slightly, passing the new sound to the next person
- Continue until the vowel has transformed completely

## 3. Timorese Song Resonance Challenge
- Groups are assigned different traditional Timorese songs
- They must identify and reproduce the characteristic resonance qualities of the song

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Resonance Journal
- Students record themselves singing a simple phrase with different resonance focuses
- They write reflections on how changes in resonance affect their tone quality

## 2. Vowel Modification Etudes
- Provide short melodic patterns for students to practice
- Students sing the patterns multiple times, modifying vowels to enhance resonance

## 3. Resonance Visualization
- Students use a spectrogram app on their phones to visualize their resonance
- Experiment with different mouth shapes and observe changes in the spectrogram

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Resonance Relaxation
- Guide students through a series of gentle humming exercises
- Focus on feeling vibrations in different parts of the body

## 2. Timorese Lullaby Circle
- Form a circle and teach a simple Timorese lullaby
- Each student takes a turn singing a phrase, focusing on resonant tone

## 3. Resonance Reflection
- Students share one new discovery about their own resonance
- Discuss how they might apply this knowledge to their singing practice
