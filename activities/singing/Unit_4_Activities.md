- Class votes on the clearest and fastest performance

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Phoneme Exploration (10 minutes)
- Teacher demonstrates unique Tetum and Portuguese phonemes
- Students mirror the teacher, using hand-held mirrors to observe their articulation
- Focus on challenging sounds like Portuguese nasal vowels or Tetum glottal stops

## 2. Articulation Stations (15 minutes)
- Set up 4 stations around the room, each focusing on a different aspect of articulation:
  1. Lip shapes for vowels
  2. Tongue placement for consonants
  3. Nasal sounds in Portuguese
  4. Glottal stops in Tetum
- Students rotate through stations, spending 3 minutes at each

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Diction Detective Pairs (10 minutes)

- They identify and underline potentially challenging words or sounds
- Pairs practice pronouncing these words, giving each other feedback
- Class reconvenes to share the most challenging words found

## 2. Vowel Harmony Quartets (15 minutes)
- Divide class into groups of four
- Each group is assigned a set of Portuguese vowel sounds
- Groups create a short, four-part harmony using only their assigned vowels

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Mirror Monologues (5 minutes)
- Students choose a short phrase from the Portuguese fado lyrics

- Students stand in a circle
- Each student states one thing they learned about articulation today
- They must articulate their statement with exaggerated clarity

## 2. Relaxation Resonance (5 minutes)
- Guide students through gentle humming exercises
- Start with closed mouth, then open to different vowel sounds
- Focus on feeling resonance while maintaining relaxed articulation

## 3. Diction Dedication (5 minutes)
- Students write down one specific articulation goal for their homework practice
- Share goals with a partner for accountability
- Teacher collects goals to review progress in the next lesson
