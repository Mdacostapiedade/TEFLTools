# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Register Exploration Sirens
- Students perform vocal sirens, focusing on feeling the transition between chest and head voice
- Use hand gestures to visually represent the movement between registers

## 2. Mirror Work
- In pairs, students take turns making exaggerated facial expressions while vocalizing
- Partner observes and tries to replicate the sound and expression

## 3. Breath Support Pulsing
- Students practice short, rhythmic pulses on a single note, alternating between chest and head voice
- Incorporate Timorese rhythmic patterns into the exercise

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Register Identification Game
- Play short audio clips of Timorese singers
- Students hold up colored cards to indicate which register they hear (e.g., blue for chest, red for head, purple for mixed)

## 2. Passaggio Navigation
- Using a piano, guide students through scales that cross their passaggio
- Students focus on maintaining an even tone through the transition

## 3. Timorese Song Analysis
- Provide lyrics and recordings of traditional Timorese songs
- Students mark the lyrics to indicate where register changes occur

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Register Relay Race
- Divide class into teams
- Each team member must sing a phrase in a specific register, then "pass" to the next teammate who sings in a different register

## 2. Timorese Vocal Arrangement
- In small groups, students arrange a simple Timorese melody for multiple voices
- Focus on utilizing different registers for each part

## 3. Register Storytelling
- Groups create a short story where each sentence must be sung in a different register
- Perform for the class, who guess which register is being used

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Register Isolation
- Students practice sustaining notes in each register, focusing on the physical sensations
- Use a mirror to observe changes in posture and facial expression

## 2. Smooth Transitions
- Provide a series of arpeggios that cross register boundaries
- Students record themselves and self-evaluate their transitions

## 3. Timorese Song Interpretation
- Each student selects a traditional Timorese song
- Practice performing with intentional use of different registers to enhance expression

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Register Round-Robin
- Form a circle and pass a sustained note around, each student changing to a different register

## 2. Reflection Journaling
- Students write about their experiences with different registers
- Prompt them to describe physical sensations and challenges they encountered

## 3. Vocal Massage
- Guide students through gentle massage techniques for the larynx and surrounding areas
- Incorporate deep breathing to relax the vocal mechanism
