# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Sound Scavenger Hunt (10 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Give each group a list of sounds to find within the classroom or nearby area (e.g., a high-pitched sound, a rhythmic sound, a soothing sound)
- Groups compete to find and recreate all the sounds on their list

## 2. Resonance Circle (5 minutes)
- Form a circle with the entire class
- Start with one person humming a note
- The next person matches the note and adds their voice
- Continue around the circle until everyone is humming in unison

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Sound Wave Visualization (15 minutes)
- Use a Chladni plate or a speaker with salt/sand to demonstrate sound wave patterns
- Experiment with different frequencies and observe the changing patterns
- Discuss how these patterns relate to the concept of resonance

## 2. Body Scanning with Sound (20 minutes)
- Guide students through a body scan meditation while playing different frequencies
- Use singing bowls or recorded tones
- Ask students to note any physical sensations or emotional responses to different sounds

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Resonance Detectives (15 minutes)
- In pairs, give students various objects (glasses, bowls, tubes)
- Challenge them to find the resonant frequency of each object using their voice or instruments
- Have pairs demonstrate their findings to the class

## 2. Entrainment Experiment (20 minutes)
- In groups of four, have students create a simple rhythm using body percussion
- One student starts a steady beat, and others gradually join in
- Groups observe and discuss how their rhythms naturally synchronize

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Frequency Feeling Journal (10 minutes)
- Provide students with headphones and access to pure tone generators (apps or websites)
- Have them listen to different frequencies and record their physical and emotional responses
- Encourage students to find their "favorite" frequency

## 2. Personal Resonance Exploration (15 minutes)
- Students use their voices to find objects in the room that resonate with their pitch
- They document which pitches resonate with which objects
- Reflect on how this might apply to sound healing practices

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Sound Healing Intention Setting (10 minutes)
- Students write down a personal intention for healing or wellness
- In a circle, each student sounds a singing bowl or chime and speaks their intention
- The group responds with a collective "Om" or chosen affirmation

## 2. Sonic Gratitude Chain (5 minutes)
- Start with one student expressing gratitude for a sound they experienced today
- They make that sound, and the next student continues the chain with a new sound
- Continue until everyone has participated, creating a "soundscape of gratitude"
