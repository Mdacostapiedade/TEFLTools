# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Vocal Awakening Circle (5 minutes)
- Students stand in a circle
- Each person makes a unique vocal sound (e.g., hum, sigh, trill)
- The sound is passed around the circle, with each person mimicking and then transforming it

## 2. Resonance Body Scan (5 minutes)
- Students lie on yoga mats
- Guide them through a body scan, asking them to hum and notice where they feel vibrations
- Gradually move from toes to head, exploring different pitches

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Vowel Sound Journey (10 minutes)
- Introduce the five main vowel sounds: A, E, I, O, U
- Students practice each sound, focusing on where they feel the vibrations
- Guide students to move through the vowels, creating a "sound journey" from low to high pitches

## 2. Overtone Listening Exercise (10 minutes)
- Play recordings of overtone singing
- Students close their eyes and raise their hand when they hear distinct overtones
- Discuss the experience and sensations felt during listening

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Healing Intention Duets (15 minutes)
- Pairs choose a healing intention (e.g., relaxation, energy boost)
- Create a short toning sequence to address their chosen intention
- Practice and refine their duet

## 2. Vowel Sound Healing Circle (20 minutes)
- Groups of 4-5 students
- Each group chooses a body area to focus on
- Create a sequence of vowel sounds to "heal" that area
- Perform for other groups and explain their choices

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Personal Toning Exploration (10 minutes)
- Students find a comfortable space in the room
- Experiment with different tones, pitches, and volumes
- Journal about physical sensations and emotional responses

## 2. Vowel Sound Self-Massage (5 minutes)
- Guide students to use specific vowel sounds while gently massaging different body parts
- Encourage awareness of vibrations and any changes in sensation

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

- Class stands in a circle
- Begin with a single tone and gradually build to a group harmony
- Slowly fade out to silence

## 2. Reflection and Intention Setting (5 minutes)
