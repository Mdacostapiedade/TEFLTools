# Warm-up Activities

## Sound Awareness Circle
- Students sit in a circle with eyes closed
- Teacher creates various sounds (e.g., tapping, rustling paper, clinking glasses)
- Students point in the direction of each sound without opening their eyes
- Discuss how sound travels and how we perceive it

## Body as an Instrument
- Students explore making sounds with their bodies (clapping, stomping, snapping)
- In pairs, create a short rhythmic sequence using only body sounds
- Pairs perform for the class

# Main Lesson Activities

## Instrument Show and Tell
- Display various sound healing instruments
- For each instrument:
  - Demonstrate proper playing technique
  - Allow students to feel the vibrations
  - Discuss its traditional uses and healing properties

## Sound Healing Scavenger Hunt
- Hide fact cards about different instruments around the room
- Students search for cards and match them to the correct instruments
- Discuss findings as a class

## Resonance Experiment
- Use singing bowls filled with different amounts of water
- Students observe how water reacts to the bowl's vibrations
- Discuss the concept of resonance and how it relates to healing

# Group Work Tasks

## Instrument Orchestra
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group is assigned a different type of instrument
- Create a short composition combining all instruments
- Perform for the class, explaining the intention behind the piece

## Healing Soundscape Design
- In groups, students design a soundscape for a specific healing purpose (e.g., relaxation, energy boost)
- Groups sketch out their design, including instrument choices and playing techniques
- Present designs to the class, explaining their choices

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Resonance Journal
- Students experiment with different instruments
- Write reflections on how each instrument's sound affects them personally
- Note any physical sensations, emotions, or thoughts that arise

## Instrument Technique Practice
- Set up stations with different instruments
- Students rotate through stations, practicing basic techniques
- Use instruction cards at each station for guidance

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## Sound Bath Experience
- Students lie down comfortably
- Teacher (or skilled student) leads a short sound bath using various instruments
- Afterwards, students share their experiences and insights

## Reflection Circle
- Sit in a circle, pass around a singing bowl
- Each student shares one new thing they learned about sound healing
- When finished sharing, gently strike the bowl to signal the next person's turn

## Sound Healing Intention Setting
- Students write down a personal healing intention
- In pairs, they create a short sound sequence to support that intention
- Pairs perform for each other, focusing on the healing intention
