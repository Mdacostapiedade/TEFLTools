# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Architecture Scavenger Hunt
- Students form small groups and are given a list of architectural features to find in photos of buildings (both local and global).
- Features include: sustainable elements, local materials, cultural symbols, etc.
- Groups compete to identify the most features in 5 minutes.

## 2. "Two Truths and a Lie" about Buildings
- Each student writes three statements about buildings or architecture, two true and one false.
- Students share their statements, and classmates guess which is the lie.
- Encourages critical thinking about architectural knowledge.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Sustainable Architecture Jigsaw
- Divide class into expert groups, each focusing on one aspect of sustainable architecture.
- Groups research their topic and become "experts."
- Regroup students so each new group has one expert from each topic.
- Experts teach their topic to their new group.

## 2. Virtual Tour of Sustainable Buildings
- Use online resources to take a virtual tour of sustainable buildings around the world.
- Students identify and discuss sustainable features they observe.
- Compare and contrast with local Timorese architecture.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Local Materials Debate
- Divide class into pairs or small groups.
- Assign each group a local building material and an imported alternative.
- Groups prepare arguments for using their assigned local material over the imported one.
- Hold a class debate on the merits of local vs. imported materials.

## 2. Sustainable Design Challenge
- In pairs, students design a small structure (e.g., bus stop, market stall) using only local materials.
- Pairs present their designs, explaining how they incorporated sustainability principles.
- Class votes on the most innovative and sustainable design.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Sustainability Checklist Creation
- Students individually create a checklist for evaluating the sustainability of a building.
- Include categories such as materials, energy efficiency, cultural appropriateness, etc.
- Share and compare checklists with classmates.

## 2. Sketch and Analyze
- Students choose a traditional Timorese building from provided images.
- Sketch the building and label key features that contribute to its sustainability and cultural significance.
- Write a short analysis of how the building reflects local architectural principles.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Sustainable Architecture Pictionary
- Divide class into teams.
- One student from each team draws a sustainable architecture concept or feature.
- Team members guess the concept within a time limit.
- Reinforces key vocabulary and concepts in a fun, engaging way.

## 2. Reflection Web
- Create a large web on the board with "Sustainable Local Architecture" in the center.
- Students add concepts, ideas, or questions they've learned or still have about the topic.
- Discuss the web as a class, addressing any remaining questions or misconceptions.

## 3. Exit Ticket
- Students write on a slip of paper:
  1. One thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
  3. One way they could apply sustainable architecture principles in their daily life
- Collect tickets as students leave, use for future lesson planning and to address lingering questions.
