# Engaging Activities for Improving Local Techniques Lesson

## Warm-up Activities

### 1. Building Issues Bingo (10 minutes)
- Create bingo cards with common building issues in Timorese structures
- Show images of buildings, and students mark off issues they spot
- First to get a line wins and explains the issues they identified

### 2. Material Mystery Box (10 minutes)
- Pass around boxes with local building materials hidden inside
- Students feel the materials and guess what they are
- Discuss the properties and potential uses of each material

## Main Lesson Activities

### 1. Damp-proofing Demonstration (15 minutes)
- Set up two small earth wall sections, one with damp-proofing and one without
- Pour water at the base and observe how it travels up the walls
- Discuss the implications for building durability and comfort

### 2. Ventilation Simulation (20 minutes)
- Use a simple cardboard model house with movable windows and doors
- Use a small fan to simulate wind and colored smoke to show airflow
- Students experiment with different window and door configurations

## Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### 1. Structural Reinforcement Challenge (30 minutes)
- Divide class into groups and provide each with basic building materials
- Challenge groups to build the tallest structure that can support a small weight
- Encourage use of reinforcement techniques discussed in the lesson

### 2. Community Building Redesign (40 minutes)
- Assign each pair a photo of a traditional Timorese building
- Task them with redesigning it to incorporate at least three improvements
- Groups present their designs and explain their choices

## Individual Practice Exercises

### 1. Foundation Sketch (15 minutes)
- Provide a worksheet with an outline of a simple house
- Students sketch and label an improved foundation design
- Include damp-proofing and basic reinforcement elements

### 2. Ventilation Problem-Solving (20 minutes)
- Give students floor plans of houses with poor ventilation
- Task them with redesigning the layout to improve air circulation
- Students explain their changes in writing

## Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### 1. Improvement Auction (15 minutes)
- Write various building improvements on cards
- Give students play money and conduct an auction
- Discuss which improvements were most valued and why

### 2. One-Minute Paper (5 minutes)
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
- Collect papers to inform future lessons and address lingering questions

### 3. Building Technique Charades (10 minutes)
- Students act out various building techniques or improvements
- Class guesses the technique being demonstrated
- Reinforces key concepts in a fun, interactive way
