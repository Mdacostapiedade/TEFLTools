# Warm-up Activities

## Solar Power Charades
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group receives cards with solar power components or concepts
- Students take turns acting out the terms while their team guesses
- Terms include: solar panel, inverter, battery, sunlight, electricity, etc.

## Sustainable Tech Matching Game
- Create a board with two columns: "Technology" and "Benefit"
- Students match sustainable technologies to their corresponding benefits
- Examples: Solar panels - Clean energy, Rainwater harvesting - Water conservation

# Main Lesson Activities

## Solar System Component Puzzle
- Provide groups with a large diagram of a solar power system with blank spaces
- Give students cards with component names and descriptions
- Students discuss and place the cards in the correct positions on the diagram

## Rainwater Harvesting Simulation
- Set up a model house with a sloped roof and gutters
- Use a watering can to simulate rain and demonstrate water collection
- Students measure the amount of water collected and calculate potential savings

## Ecological Sanitation Debate
- Divide the class into two groups: proponents and skeptics of composting toilets
- Each group researches and prepares arguments for their position
- Conduct a structured debate on the benefits and challenges of ecological sanitation

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Solar Village Planning
- In small groups, students receive a map of a fictional Timorese village
- Groups identify optimal locations for solar installations
- They present their plan, explaining their choices based on sunlight exposure, proximity to buildings, etc.

## Rainwater System Design Challenge
- Pairs of students design a rainwater harvesting system for a traditional Timorese home
- Provide a template of a house and materials like straws, paper cups, and clay
- Teams create a working model and test it with a watering can

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Solar Power Output Calculator
- Students use a provided formula and solar irradiance data for Timor-Leste
- They calculate potential power output for different sizes of solar systems
- Exercise includes interpreting results and suggesting appropriate system sizes for various needs

## Sustainable Tech Integration Worksheet
- Students receive profiles of different Timorese households
- They recommend appropriate sustainable technologies for each scenario
- Worksheet prompts students to justify their choices based on needs, resources, and environmental factors

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Sustainable Tech Pictionary
- Divide the class into teams
- Students take turns drawing sustainable technologies or concepts
- Teams compete to guess the most correct answers in a set time

## Reflection Web
- Create a web diagram on the board with "Sustainable Technologies" in the center
- Students add post-it notes with learned concepts, connecting them to the center or to other ideas
- Discuss the connections and how these technologies can work together in Timor-Leste

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the prompt: "How could sustainable technologies change daily life in rural Timor-Leste?"
- Volunteers share their thoughts, fostering a final class discussion
