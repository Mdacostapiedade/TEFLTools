# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Community Design Word Cloud
- Students write down words they associate with "community participation in design" on sticky notes
- Collect and arrange notes on a board to create a word cloud
- Discuss emerging themes and their importance in participatory design

## 2. Silent Line-up
- Students line up silently based on their level of experience with community engagement (from least to most)
- Once in line, students share their experiences with those nearby
- Discuss the range of experiences within the class and how they can be valuable in participatory design

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Participatory Design Technique Jigsaw
- Divide class into groups, each assigned a different participatory design technique
- Groups research their technique and create a short presentation
- Regroup with one member from each original group to share and learn about all techniques

## 2. Stakeholder Mapping Exercise
- Provide a hypothetical community project scenario
- Students work in groups to identify and map all potential stakeholders
- Groups present their maps and discuss the importance of inclusive stakeholder engagement

## 3. Facilitation Skills Fishbowl
- Set up an inner and outer circle of chairs
- Inner circle role-plays a community design workshop scenario
- Outer circle observes and provides feedback on facilitation skills
- Rotate roles to give multiple students practice in facilitation

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Community Engagement Plan Development
- In pairs, students develop a community engagement plan for a given scenario
- Pairs swap plans and provide constructive feedback
- Groups refine their plans based on feedback

## 2. Participatory Design Technique Role-play
- Assign each group a different participatory design technique
- Groups prepare and perform a role-play demonstrating their technique
- Class discusses the strengths and challenges of each technique

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Reflection Journal
- Students write a personal reflection on the challenges and opportunities of participatory design
- Prompts: How might your own biases affect community engagement? What skills do you need to develop?

## 2. Technique Application Worksheet
- Provide a worksheet with various community design scenarios
- Students individually select and justify appropriate participatory design techniques for each scenario

## 3. Active Listening Practice
- Play short audio clips of community members expressing design preferences
- Students practice note-taking and summarizing key points
- Discuss the importance of active listening in community engagement

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Participatory Design Bingo
- Create bingo cards with key terms and concepts from the lesson
- Read out definitions or examples, students mark off corresponding terms
- Discuss any terms that were challenging or new

## 2. One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on: "What was the most important thing you learned today, and what question do you still have?"
- Collect papers and address common themes or questions

## 3. Commitment Circle
- Students stand in a circle and take turns sharing one way they will apply participatory design principles in their future work
- End with a group reflection on the collective impact they can make through community engagement
