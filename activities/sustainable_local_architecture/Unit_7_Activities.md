# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Project Planning Pictionary

- Divide the class into small teams
- Give each team a set of cards with project planning terms (e.g., "feasibility study," "procurement," "sustainability metrics")
- Teams take turns drawing the terms while their teammates guess
- The first team to guess correctly wins a point

## 2. Sustainability Scavenger Hunt

- Create a list of sustainable building materials and practices
- Give students 5 minutes to find examples of these around the classroom or campus
- Students share their findings and explain how each item contributes to sustainability

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Project Lifecycle Jigsaw

- Divide students into seven groups, each representing a stage of the project lifecycle
- Each group researches their stage and creates a poster with key sustainability considerations
- Groups then present their findings to the class, creating a complete picture of the sustainable project lifecycle

## 2. Local vs. Imported Materials Debate

- Split the class into two teams: one advocating for local materials, the other for imported materials
- Give teams time to prepare arguments based on cost, sustainability, and practicality
- Conduct a structured debate, with teams presenting arguments and rebuttals
- Conclude with a class discussion on finding the right balance

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Sustainable Supply Chain Mapping

- In pairs, students create a visual map of the supply chain for a local building material (e.g., bamboo)
- They identify potential sustainability issues and propose solutions at each stage of the chain
- Pairs share their maps and discuss strategies for improving local material supply chains

## 2. Cost-Benefit Analysis Challenge

- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a scenario for a building project and data on material costs, durability, and environmental impact
- Groups conduct a cost-benefit analysis comparing sustainable and conventional approaches
- Teams present their findings and recommendations to the class

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Sustainability Metrics Worksheet

- Provide students with a list of project details for a hypothetical building
- Students individually develop a set of sustainability metrics to evaluate the project
- They then use these metrics to score the project and suggest improvements

## 2. Project Plan Puzzle

- Give each student a jumbled list of project planning steps
- Students must arrange the steps in the correct order to create a logical project plan
- They then add sustainability considerations to each step of their plan

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. One-Minute Paper

- At the end of the lesson, give students one minute to write down:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
- Collect the papers and address common themes or questions

## 2. Sustainability Pledge

- Students write a personal pledge on how they will incorporate sustainability into their future project planning and management
- Volunteers share their pledges with the class
- Create a class "Sustainability Charter" combining the best ideas from individual pledges
