# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Material Scavenger Hunt (10 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a list of sustainable local materials
- Groups race to find or identify as many materials as possible within the classroom or immediate surroundings
- Discuss findings and potential applications in architecture

## 2. Sustainable Design Pictionary (15 minutes)
- Create cards with sustainable design concepts or local building techniques
- Students take turns drawing while team members guess the concept
- Encourage creative representations of abstract ideas

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Site Analysis Jigsaw (30 minutes)
- Divide class into expert groups, each focusing on a different aspect of site analysis (climate, topography, local resources, cultural context)
- Experts research their topic and prepare a short presentation
- Regroup students into mixed teams to share expertise and conduct a comprehensive site analysis for a given location in Timor-Leste

## 2. Sustainable Material Speed Dating (25 minutes)
- Set up stations with different local building materials
- Students rotate through stations in pairs, spending 3 minutes at each
- At each station, pairs discuss pros and cons of the material and potential applications
- Conclude with a full-class discussion on material choices

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Community Building Design Charrette (45 minutes)
- In groups of 4-5, students develop a rapid design concept for a community building
- Provide each group with a different set of constraints (e.g., limited materials, specific climate challenges, cultural requirements)
- Groups present their concepts to the class, explaining how they addressed the constraints

## 2. Passive Design Strategy Puzzle (30 minutes)
- Create large puzzle pieces representing different passive design strategies
- In pairs, students assemble the puzzle to create an optimal passive design for a Timorese building
- Pairs explain their choices and discuss potential trade-offs

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Sketch-Up Challenge (20 minutes)
- Provide students with a basic site plan and building requirements
- Individually, students use SketchUp to create a quick 3D model incorporating at least three sustainable design features
- Students annotate their models to explain their design choices

## 2. Material Innovation Brainstorming (15 minutes)
- Students individually brainstorm innovative ways to use traditional Timorese materials in modern construction
- Encourage out-of-the-box thinking and cross-material applications
- Share ideas in a brief class discussion

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Sustainable Design Bingo (10 minutes)
- Create bingo cards with sustainable design concepts and local building techniques
- Call out definitions or examples, and students mark off corresponding terms
- First student to complete a line wins and explains the concepts in their winning line

## 2. One-Minute Paper (5 minutes)
- Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned and one question they still have
- Collect papers to inform future lessons and address any common questions

## 3. Design Principle Carousel (15 minutes)
- Post large sheets around the room with different sustainable design principles
- Students circulate, adding ideas or examples to each sheet
- Conclude with a brief discussion of the most interesting or innovative ideas
