# Warm-up Activities

## 1. System Scavenger Hunt (10 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Give each group a list of systems to find in the classroom or school grounds (e.g., heating/cooling system, waste management system, communication system)
- Groups race to identify and briefly describe how each system works
- Discuss findings as a class, highlighting interconnections between systems

## 2. "I Am Part of a System" Game (5 minutes)
- Students stand in a circle
- One student starts by saying "I am [object/person] in the [system]" (e.g., "I am a farmer in the food system")
- The next student must connect to the previous one by saying how they relate (e.g., "I am the soil that the farmer cultivates")
- Continue until everyone has participated

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Synergetics Demonstration (15 minutes)
- Use simple materials (e.g., straws, string, paper clips) to demonstrate synergetic principles
- Show how combining elements creates structures stronger than the sum of their parts
- Have students predict and test the strength of different configurations

## 2. Systems Thinking Role-Play (20 minutes)
- Assign students roles within a local system (e.g., water supply: government official, farmer, urban resident, water treatment plant worker)
- Present a scenario (e.g., drought) and have students discuss how it affects their role and others
- Encourage students to identify feedback loops and unintended consequences

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Local System Analysis (25 minutes)
- In pairs or small groups, choose a local system in Timor-Leste (e.g., fishing industry, coffee production)
- Create a visual representation of the system, identifying key components, relationships, and external factors
- Present findings to another group, discussing potential improvements using synergetic principles

## 2. Fuller-Inspired Innovation Challenge (30 minutes)
- Divide class into groups of 3-4
- Present a local challenge (e.g., lack of affordable housing)
- Groups use Buckminster Fuller's approach to brainstorm innovative solutions
- Create a quick prototype or sketch of their best idea
- Present solutions to the class, explaining how they applied synergetic principles

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Personal System Mapping (15 minutes)
- Students individually map out a system they interact with daily (e.g., their morning routine, school day)
- Identify key components, relationships, and potential areas for improvement
- Write a brief reflection on how understanding this system as a whole could lead to positive changes

## 2. Synergetic Solutions Journal (10 minutes)
- Provide students with a local problem scenario
- Individually, students write in their journals, applying synergetic principles to propose a solution
- Encourage creative thinking and consideration of multiple interconnected factors

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Synergy Circle (10 minutes)
- Form a standing circle with the entire class
- Each student shares one new insight they gained about systems thinking or synergetics
- As each student shares, they hold a piece of string and pass the ball of string to the next speaker
- By the end, a web is formed, visually representing the interconnectedness of ideas

## 2. Fuller Quote Reflection (5 minutes)
- Display a relevant Buckminster Fuller quote on the board
- Students take a moment to silently reflect on how the quote relates to the lesson
- Invite a few volunteers to share their thoughts
- Encourage students to find their own inspiring Fuller quotes for the next class
