# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Problem Web
- Students stand in a circle
- One student holds a ball of yarn and states a local problem
- They toss the yarn to another student who states a related problem
- Continue until a web is formed, visually representing interconnected issues

## 2. Rapid Ideation Challenge
- Display an image of a complex local structure (e.g., a bridge, building)
- Give students 2 minutes to sketch an improved design
- Share designs in pairs, explaining improvements

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Design Science Principles Jigsaw
- Divide class into groups, each assigned a design science principle
- Groups research their principle and create a visual representation
- Regroup to teach others about their assigned principle

## 2. Systems Mapping Exercise
- In small groups, create a systems map of a local issue (e.g., water scarcity)
- Identify key components, relationships, and feedback loops
- Present maps to the class, discussing potential intervention points

## 3. Future Scenario Planning
- Introduce a current local challenge
- Groups develop three possible future scenarios (best case, worst case, most likely)
- Apply design science principles to create solutions for each scenario

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Design Science Debate
- Divide class into pairs
- Assign each pair a controversial local project
- One student argues for the project using design science principles, the other against
- Switch roles and repeat with a new project

## 2. Synergy Solution Workshop
- In groups of 4-5, identify a local problem
- Apply the concept of synergy to combine two seemingly unrelated solutions
- Develop a presentation on how the combined solution is more effective

## 3. Ephemeralization Challenge
- Groups choose a local system or process
- Apply Fuller's concept of ephemeralization to redesign it
- Create a before-and-after comparison to show increased efficiency

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Personal Comprehensive Problem-Solving Journal
- Students identify a personal or local problem
- Over a week, apply each step of comprehensive problem-solving
- Document the process, insights, and potential solutions

## 2. Design Science Principle Application
- Provide a list of local issues and design science principles
- Students choose one of each and write a short proposal on how to apply the principle to the issue

## 3. Geodesic Structure Sketch
- Students research geodesic structures and their benefits
- Sketch a geodesic structure designed for a specific local need
- Write a brief explanation of how it embodies design science principles

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Design Science Reflection Circle
- Students stand in a circle
- Each shares one key insight from the lesson and how they might apply it

## 2. Future Vision Gallery Walk
- Students create quick sketches of Timor-Leste in 50 years, applying lesson concepts
- Post sketches around the room
- Class does a silent gallery walk, leaving sticky note comments on peers' visions

## 3. One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most important thing they learned
  2. One question they still have
- Collect papers to inform future lessons and address lingering questions
