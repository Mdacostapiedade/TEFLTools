# Warm-up Activities

## Resource Matching Game
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a set of cards featuring pictures of Timor-Leste's natural resources and another set with their names and primary uses
- Students race to correctly match the pictures with their corresponding names and uses
- Discuss the results as a class, highlighting any interesting or surprising facts about each resource

## Resource Importance Ranking
- Students individually rank Timor-Leste's natural resources in order of perceived importance to the country's development
- In pairs, students compare their rankings and discuss reasons for their choices
- Share some rankings with the whole class and facilitate a brief discussion on the importance of various resources

# Main Lesson Activities

## Interactive Resource Map
- Project a map of Timor-Leste on the board
- As you present each key resource, invite students to come up and place a symbol or sticky note on the map where that resource is primarily found
- Discuss the geographical distribution of resources and its implications for management

## Sustainable Management Principles Jigsaw
- Divide the class into "expert groups," each assigned a specific sustainable management principle
- Expert groups research and discuss their assigned principle
- Regroup students into "teaching groups" with one expert from each principle
- Students take turns teaching their principle to their new group

## Synergetics Demonstration
- Use physical props (e.g., straws and connectors) to demonstrate basic synergetic structures
- Show how these structures can be applied to resource management challenges
- Invite students to create their own synergetic models representing resource systems

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Resource Challenge Analysis
- Assign each group a specific resource challenge in Timor-Leste (e.g., deforestation, water scarcity, oil dependency)
- Groups research the challenge and its current management approaches
- Groups present their findings to the class, followed by a Q&A session

## Synergetic Solutions Workshop
- In small groups, students apply Fuller's synergetic principles to develop innovative solutions for a given resource challenge
- Groups create a visual representation of their solution (e.g., diagram, model, or poster)
- Groups present their solutions in a gallery walk format, with other students providing feedback

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Ecosystem Services Identification
- Provide students with a list of Timor-Leste's ecosystems
- Students individually identify and list the ecosystem services provided by each
- Students reflect on how these services contribute to resource sustainability

## Renewable vs. Non-renewable Resource Classification
- Give students a mixed list of resources found in Timor-Leste
- Students classify each resource as renewable or non-renewable
- Students explain their reasoning for each classification

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Resource Management Concept Map
- As a class, create a large concept map on the board linking key terms, resources, and management strategies discussed in the lesson
- Invite students to contribute connections and explain their reasoning

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the following prompt: "What is the most important thing you learned today about sustainable resource management in Timor-Leste?"
- Collect the papers and read a few responses aloud to reinforce key concepts

## Exit Ticket: 3-2-1 Reflection
- Students write down:
  * 3 things they learned
  * 2 questions they still have
  * 1 way they could apply this knowledge in their community
- Use these reflections to guide future lessons and discussions
