# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Housing Structure Gallery Walk
- Display images of various housing structures around the classroom
- Students walk around, observing each structure
- They write one advantage and one disadvantage of each design on sticky notes
- Discuss findings as a class, focusing on suitability for Timor-Leste's climate and resources

## 2. Shelter Building Challenge
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a set of materials (e.g., paper, tape, straws)
- Challenge them to build the strongest and most efficient shelter possible in 5 minutes
- Test structures by simulating wind or rain (using a fan or water spray)
- Discuss what made certain designs more effective

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Geodesic Dome Demonstration
- Use a large-scale model or virtual simulation to demonstrate the principles of geodesic structures
- Highlight key features such as strength, efficiency, and sustainability
- Encourage students to ask questions and make observations

## 2. Local Materials Exploration Station
- Set up stations with samples of local building materials (bamboo, thatch, etc.)
- Students rotate through stations, examining and documenting properties of each material
- Discuss how these materials could be incorporated into modern sustainable designs

## 3. Case Study Analysis
- Present a case study of a successful sustainable housing project in a similar climate
- Guide students through analyzing the design choices, materials used, and environmental considerations
- Encourage critical thinking about how similar approaches could be applied in Timor-Leste

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Geodesic Dome Construction
- In small groups, students build a small-scale geodesic dome using provided materials
- Groups document their construction process and challenges faced
- Each group presents their completed dome, explaining how it demonstrates geodesic principles

## 2. Sustainable Housing Design Challenge
- Pairs or small groups design a sustainable house for rural Timor-Leste
- Provide design constraints (e.g., must use at least two local materials, must be climate-responsive)
- Groups create a sketch and brief description of their design
- Present designs to the class for peer feedback

## 3. Tensegrity Structure Experiment
- In pairs, students attempt to create a simple tensegrity structure using provided materials
- Encourage experimentation and iteration
- Discuss how tensegrity principles could be applied to housing design

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Geodesic Math Worksheet
- Provide a worksheet with problems related to geodesic geometry
- Include calculations for surface area, volume, and structural efficiency
- Students complete the worksheet individually, applying mathematical concepts to geodesic designs

## 2. Sustainable Feature Identification
- Give students images of various houses
- They identify and list sustainable features in each design
- Students then suggest additional features that could make the houses more sustainable for Timor-Leste's context

## 3. Material Properties Research
- Assign each student a local building material to research
- Students create a fact sheet about their material, including properties, traditional uses, and potential modern applications
- Compile fact sheets into a class resource guide

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Sustainable Housing Quiz Game
- Divide the class into teams
- Ask quick-fire questions about geodesic structures, sustainable housing, and local building techniques
- Award points for correct answers and creative thinking

## 2. Reflection Circle
- Form a circle with the entire class
- Pass around an object (e.g., a small geodesic model)
- Each student shares one new thing they learned and one way they could apply it in Timor-Leste

## 3. Future Housing Vision Board
- Provide magazines, newspapers, and drawing materials
- Students create individual vision boards depicting their ideal sustainable house for Timor-Leste in 2050
- Display vision boards and allow time for a brief gallery walk
