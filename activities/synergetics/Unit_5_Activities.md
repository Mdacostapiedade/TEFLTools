# Warm-up Activities

## Energy Source Scavenger Hunt
- Students walk around the classroom or school grounds for 5 minutes
- They list all energy sources they can identify (e.g., lights, computers, air conditioning)
- In pairs, students categorize their findings as renewable or non-renewable

## Energy Pictionary
- Divide the class into two teams
- Each team takes turns drawing energy-related terms (e.g., solar panel, wind turbine, power plant)
- Other team members guess the term within a time limit

# Main Lesson Activities

## Virtual Tour of Timor-Leste's Energy Landscape
- Use Google Earth or similar tools to explore Timor-Leste's geography
- Identify potential sites for renewable energy projects
- Discuss challenges and opportunities for each location

## Renewable Energy Jigsaw
- Divide class into expert groups, each focusing on one renewable energy source
- Students research their assigned source and its potential in Timor-Leste
- Regroup into mixed teams to share knowledge and create a comprehensive energy plan

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Energy Audit Challenge
- In pairs, students conduct a mini energy audit of a designated area
- Use energy consumption measuring devices and observation
- Create an "Energy Efficiency Action Plan" with at least five recommendations

## Renewable Energy Debate
- Divide class into groups, each representing a different renewable energy source
- Groups prepare arguments for why their energy source is best for Timor-Leste
- Conduct a structured debate, with teams presenting and rebutting arguments

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Energy Journal
- Students track their personal energy use for one day
- Identify areas where they can reduce consumption or switch to renewable sources
- Write a reflection on their findings and proposed changes

## Renewable Energy Infographic
- Create an infographic explaining one renewable energy source
- Include how it works, benefits, challenges, and potential applications in Timor-Leste
- Use online tools like Canva or Piktochart

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Energy Solutions Gallery Walk
- Students display their renewable energy system designs or infographics
- Conduct a gallery walk where students view and provide feedback on each other's work
- Use sticky notes for comments and questions

## Timor-Leste Energy Future Visualization
- Guided visualization exercise imagining Timor-Leste in 20 years with sustainable energy systems
- Students draw or write about their vision
- Share and discuss common themes and innovative ideas

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute answering: "What's the most important thing you learned today about renewable energy in Timor-Leste?"
- Share responses in small groups or with the whole class
