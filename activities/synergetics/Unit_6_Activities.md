# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Transportation Time Machine

- Students form pairs and imagine they're time travelers.
- Each pair draws two cards: one with a year (e.g., 1950, 2000, 2050) and one with a location in Timor-Leste.
- They have 3 minutes to act out how people would travel in that time and place.
- Class guesses the year and location.

## 2. Communication Charades

- Students play charades in small groups.
- Words/phrases are related to communication methods (e.g., text message, radio, smoke signals).
- Focus on both modern and traditional methods used in Timor-Leste.

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Infrastructure Scavenger Hunt

- Students use laptops/tablets to research Timor-Leste's current infrastructure.
- They create a digital collage of images representing different aspects of transportation and communication networks.
- Class discussion on what they found and what's missing.

## 2. Virtual Field Trip

- Using Google Earth or similar tools, take a virtual tour of Timor-Leste.
- Students identify and mark key transportation routes and communication towers.
- Discuss the challenges of terrain and rural access.

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Rural Connectivity Challenge

- Groups of 3-4 students are assigned a remote village in Timor-Leste.
- They must design a plan to improve both transportation and communication access.
- Groups create a poster outlining their solution and present to the class.

## 2. System Impact Web

- In groups, students create a large web diagram on poster paper.
- They identify how improvements in transportation and communication impact other systems (education, healthcare, economy).
- Groups add sticky notes with specific examples or potential projects.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Last-Mile Delivery Design

- Students individually sketch a design for a last-mile delivery solution.
- It should be appropriate for Timor-Leste's terrain and climate.
- They write a brief explanation of how it works and its benefits.

## 2. Digital Divide Bridge

- Students write a one-page proposal for a project to bridge the digital divide in rural Timor-Leste.
- They must consider cost, sustainability, and cultural appropriateness.

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Solution Gallery Walk

- Students post their individual designs and proposals around the room.
- Class does a gallery walk, leaving constructive feedback on sticky notes.

## 2. Connectivity Concept Map

- As a class, create a large concept map on the board.
- Start with "Connectivity in Timor-Leste" in the center.
- Students add concepts, challenges, and solutions discussed during the lesson.
- Discuss how different elements are interconnected.

## 3. Reflection Journaling

- Students spend 5 minutes writing in their journals.
- Prompt: "How could improved transportation and communication change daily life in rural Timor-Leste? What challenges might arise?"
