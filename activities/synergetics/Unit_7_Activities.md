# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Education Challenge Carousel

- Divide the class into small groups
- Place large sheets of paper around the room, each with a different education challenge in Timor-Leste
- Groups rotate around the room, spending 2 minutes at each sheet
- Write potential solutions or ideas to address the challenge
- After rotating through all sheets, groups discuss and summarize the most innovative ideas

## 2. Synergy Sorting Game

- Provide groups with a set of cards containing various resources, skills, and challenges related to education in Timor-Leste
- Groups sort the cards into potential synergetic combinations
- Share and explain their most creative combinations with the class

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Fuller's Principles Jigsaw

- Assign each group a different principle from Fuller's work
- Groups research and become "experts" on their assigned principle
- Regroup with one expert from each principle to share knowledge
- Create a collaborative mind map connecting all principles to education and community development

## 2. Virtual Field Trip

- Use VR headsets or 360-degree videos to explore schools and communities in Timor-Leste
- Students take notes on observed challenges and opportunities
- Discuss how Fuller's principles could be applied to improve these real-world scenarios

# Group Work Tasks

## 1. Synergetic Solution Design Sprint

- Present groups with a specific education challenge in Timor-Leste
- Using Fuller's principles, groups brainstorm and design a solution in 30 minutes
- Create a visual representation of their solution (poster, digital presentation, or 3D model)
- Present solutions in a gallery walk format, with peers providing feedback

## 2. Community Resource Mapping

- Groups use digital mapping tools to create an interactive map of community resources in a specific region of Timor-Leste
- Identify potential synergies between resources for education initiatives
- Present maps to the class, explaining how resources could be leveraged synergetically

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Synergetic Reflection Journal

- Students maintain a digital journal throughout the lesson
- Record personal insights, connections to Fuller's principles, and ideas for application
- Include sketches, mind maps, or multimedia elements to illustrate thoughts

## 2. Mobile Learning App Wireframe

- Each student designs a basic wireframe for a mobile learning app tailored to Timor-Leste
- Focus on one specific feature that embodies synergetic principles
- Write a brief explanation of how the feature addresses a local education challenge

# Cool-down and Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Synergy Circle

- Form a large circle with the entire class
- Each student shares one key takeaway and how they plan to apply synergetic thinking in their future work
- As each person shares, they hold a piece of string and pass the ball to another student, creating a visual web of connections

## 2. Future Vision Board

- Provide magazines, art supplies, and large poster boards
- Students create individual or small group vision boards depicting their ideal education system in Timor-Leste, incorporating Fuller's principles
- Gallery walk to view and discuss each vision board
- Collectively identify common themes and innovative ideas for future exploration
