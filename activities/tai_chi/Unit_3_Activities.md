# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Breath Awareness Walk
- Students walk around the room, focusing on their natural breathing
- Instructor guides students to notice different aspects of their breath (e.g., depth, speed, location)
- On cue, students pause and share observations with a nearby partner

## 2. Balloon Breath Visualization
- Students stand in a circle, imagining a balloon in their abdomen
- Inhale: visualize the balloon expanding
- Exhale: visualize the balloon gently deflating
- Repeat for 5-10 breaths, gradually slowing the pace

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Diaphragmatic Breathing Demo and Practice
- Instructor demonstrates diaphragmatic breathing using a prop (e.g., book on abdomen)
- Students lie on mats, place hands on belly, and practice the technique
- Instructor provides individual feedback and adjustments

## 2. Qi Ball Exercise
- Students stand with hands forming a ball shape in front of the lower dantian
- Guide students to feel the space between their hands, imagining qi energy
- Slowly expand and contract the "ball," coordinating with breath

## 3. "Pushing the Mountain" Qi Gong
- Teach the basic "Pushing the Mountain" movement
- Students practice coordinating breath with the pushing and pulling motions
- Focus on feeling the connection between breath and movement

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Breathing Pattern Analysis
- In pairs, students take turns observing each other's breathing for 2 minutes
- Observer notes chest vs. abdominal movement, breath rate, and any irregularities
- Partners discuss observations and potential improvements

## 2. Qi Sensing Circle
- Form groups of 4-5 students in circles
- Students extend hands towards center, palms facing each other
- Guide students to sense the energy between their hands, slowly moving hands in and out
- Discuss the sensations experienced within the group

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Dantian Breathing Focus
- Students find a comfortable seated or standing position
- Guide them to focus their breath and attention on the lower dantian area
- Practice maintaining this focus for 3-5 minutes

## 2. Breath and Movement Integration
- Students choose a simple, repetitive movement (e.g., arm circles, gentle swaying)
- Practice coordinating the chosen movement with their breath
- Experiment with different breath-movement patterns

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Progressive Relaxation Breath
- Students lie down in a comfortable position
- Guide them through a progressive relaxation, focusing on breath awareness
- Inhale: tense a specific body part; Exhale: release and relax that part
- Move through major body areas from toes to head

## 2. Breath Reflection Circle
- Students sit in a large circle
- Each student shares one new insight or experience from the lesson
- Encourage reflections on how the breathing techniques might be applied in daily life

## 3. Collective Breath
- Students stand in a circle, holding hands
- Guide the group to synchronize their breathing
- On exhale, gently squeeze hands to "pass" the breath around the circle
- Repeat for 3-5 rounds, gradually slowing the pace
