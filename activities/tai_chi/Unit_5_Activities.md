# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Energy Wake-up Shake
- Students stand with feet shoulder-width apart
- Gently shake different body parts, starting from feet and moving up to the head
- Focus on feeling energy awakening in each area
- End with a full-body shake, imagining releasing any tension or stagnant energy

## 2. Qi Ball Visualization
- Students stand in a circle, arms relaxed at sides
- Visualize a ball of glowing energy between their hands
- Slowly move hands apart and together, feeling the resistance of the "qi ball"
- Pass the imaginary qi ball around the circle, focusing on sensing its presence

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Dantian Discovery
- Students place hands on lower abdomen to locate the lower dantian
- Guide them through deep breaths, focusing on expanding the lower abdomen
- Instruct students to visualize a warm, glowing sphere of energy in this area
- Practice drawing energy into the dantian on inhale, expanding on exhale

## 2. Microcosmic Orbit Meditation
- Students sit comfortably on mats or chairs
- Guide them through the energy pathway: up the spine, over the head, down the front
- Use visualization techniques (e.g., flowing water, light) to enhance the experience
- Practice for 5-10 minutes, encouraging gentle focus without strain

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Qi Sensing Partners
- Students pair up, standing facing each other with palms almost touching
- One partner slowly moves their hands, the other follows maintaining the distance
- Switch roles after 2-3 minutes
- Discuss sensations felt between the palms (e.g., warmth, tingling, resistance)

## 2. Energy Pathway Mapping
- In small groups, students draw a simple human figure on large paper
- Mark major energy centers (dantians) and draw the microcosmic orbit pathway
- Groups present their maps, explaining the flow of energy
- Discuss any variations or insights among the groups

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Personal Qi Gathering
- Students stand in a comfortable stance
- Guide them through a series of flowing arm movements to "gather" qi
- Movements should draw energy from the environment into the lower dantian
- Encourage students to focus on their personal sensations and visualizations

## 2. Dantian Breathing Journal
- Provide 5 minutes for silent, individual practice of dantian breathing
- Students write brief notes about their experience, sensations, or challenges
- Optional: Draw a simple diagram of where they feel the qi in their body

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Qi Circulation Tapping
- Students gently tap along the microcosmic orbit pathway on their own body
- Start at the lower dantian, move up the back, over the head, down the front
- Encourage deep, relaxed breathing throughout
- End by placing both hands over the lower dantian, feeling centered and grounded

## 2. Energy Reflection Circle
- Students sit in a circle
- Each person shares one word describing how they feel after the practice
- Optional: Pass a small object (representing gathered qi) as each person speaks
- End with a collective deep breath, visualizing shared energy in the center of the circle
