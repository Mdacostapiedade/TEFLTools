# Warm-up Activities

## Pain Experience Sharing
- In pairs, students share a personal experience with pain and how they typically manage it
- Volunteers share interesting points from their discussions with the class

## Yin-Yang Brainstorm
- Quick-fire round: Students call out examples of Yin and Yang in nature
- Teacher records responses on the whiteboard in two columns

# Main Lesson Activities

## Yin-Yang Balance Game
- Students form a line, with one end representing extreme Yin and the other extreme Yang
- Teacher calls out scenarios (e.g., "sleeping," "exercising," "eating spicy food")
- Students position themselves along the line based on where they think the scenario falls on the Yin-Yang spectrum

## Five Elements Charades
- Divide class into teams
- Each team acts out characteristics of one of the Five Elements without speaking
- Other teams guess which element is being portrayed

## Meridian Mapping
- Using large body outline posters, students take turns drawing major meridian pathways
- Class discusses the relationship between meridians and common pain points

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## TCM vs. Timorese Health Beliefs Comparison
- In small groups, create a Venn diagram comparing TCM concepts with local Timorese health beliefs
- Groups present their findings to the class

## Pain Scenario Analysis
- Provide groups with different pain scenario cards (e.g., headache, back pain, menstrual cramps)
- Groups discuss possible TCM explanations for each pain type and suggest potential treatments

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Yin-Yang Assessment
- Students complete a questionnaire to assess their own Yin-Yang balance
- They write a short reflection on how this balance (or imbalance) might affect their health

## Qi Flow Visualization
- Guided individual meditation where students visualize Qi flowing through their meridians
- Students draw or write about their experience afterward

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## TCM Concept Map
- As a class, create a large concept map on the whiteboard, connecting all the TCM terms and ideas learned in the lesson

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on:
  1. The most interesting thing they learned
  2. One question they still have about TCM and pain management

## Acupoint Self-Massage
