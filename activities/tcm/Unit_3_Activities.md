- Mark areas where they've experienced pain or where they know acupoints exist
- Share and discuss similarities and differences in pain experiences

## Cultural Connection Circle
- Form a circle and pass around a traditional Timorese object (e.g., tais cloth)
- When holding the object, share a local healing practice involving touch or pressure

# Main Lesson Activities

- Using washable markers, students trace major meridians on each other's arms or legs
- Instructor guides the class, explaining the flow of qi as they trace

## Acupoint Treasure Hunt
- Hide acupoint cards around the room
- Students search for cards and then locate the corresponding point on their body or a partner

## De Qi Sensation Experiment
- In pairs, students take turns applying pressure to LI4 (Hegu) point
- Record and discuss the sensations experienced, comparing to the concept of de qi

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Acupressure Protocol Design Challenge
- In groups of 3-4, create an acupressure protocol for a specific pain condition
- Incorporate at least one traditional Timorese massage technique
- Present protocols to the class, explaining rationale and demonstrating key points

## Cultural Integration Brainstorm
- In pairs, list ways to integrate acupressure into existing Timorese healing practices
- Create a mind map showing connections between TCM and local traditions

# Individual Practice Exercises

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Acupoint Quiz Ball
- Students stand in a circle and toss a soft ball
- The catcher must quickly name an acupoint and its general location
- If correct, they toss the ball; if incorrect, they do a quick self-acupressure technique

## Reflection Ripple
- Seated in a circle, each student shares one new thing they learned
- The next person repeats the previous insight and adds their own
- Continue until everyone has shared, creating a "ripple" of knowledge

## Integration Visualization
- Guide students through a brief visualization exercise
- Imagine incorporating acupressure into their future massage practice
- Share one concrete way they plan to use this knowledge in their community
