# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Body Awareness Bingo
- Create bingo cards with different body parts and sensations
- Students move around, asking each other about any pain or tension they feel
- First to complete a line wins and shares their findings

## 2. Energy Ball Visualization
- Students stand in a circle and imagine passing an "energy ball" to each other
- As they pass, they describe the sensation (e.g., warm, tingly, heavy)
- Discuss how this relates to the concept of Qi

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Qi Gong Movement Stations
- Set up stations around the room with different Qi Gong movements
- Students rotate through stations, practicing each movement for 2-3 minutes
- Provide handouts at each station explaining the movement and its benefits

## 2. Mindfulness Meditation Challenge
- Guide students through a series of short (2-3 minute) mindfulness exercises
- After each exercise, students rate their pain levels and relaxation on a scale of 1-10
- Discuss which techniques were most effective and why

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Cultural Adaptation Workshop
- In small groups, students choose a traditional Timorese story or symbol
- Groups create a guided meditation or Qi Gong sequence inspired by their chosen element
- Present to the class, explaining how they incorporated cultural elements

## 2. Pain Management Toolkit Design
- Pairs create a "toolkit" of mind-body techniques for a specific pain condition
- Include at least one Qi Gong exercise, one meditation technique, and one cultural element
- Share toolkits with the class and explain their choices

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Personal Qi Gong Sequence
- Students design a 5-minute Qi Gong sequence tailored to their own pain or tension areas
- Practice the sequence and note any immediate effects
- Write a brief reflection on how they might incorporate this into their daily routine

## 2. Breath Awareness Journal
- Provide a template for a week-long breath awareness journal
- Students spend 5 minutes each day focusing on their breath and noting sensations
- At the end of the week, they summarize their observations and any changes in pain levels

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Gratitude Circle
- Students stand in a circle and take turns sharing one thing they're grateful for in their body
- Encourage focus on parts that are pain-free or have improved during the lesson

## 2. Mind-Body Integration Visualization
- Guide students through a final relaxation, imagining healing energy flowing through their body
- Incorporate Timorese nature imagery (e.g., mountains, beaches) into the visualization
- End with a moment of silence and a deep breath together as a class
