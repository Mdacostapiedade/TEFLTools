# Warm-up Activities

## Microbiome Technique Matching Game
- Create cards with microbiome research techniques on one set and their descriptions on another
- Students work in pairs to match the techniques to their correct descriptions
- Discuss answers as a class, clarifying any misconceptions

## Timor-Leste Microbiome Brainstorm
- In small groups, students brainstorm potential applications of microbiome research in Timor-Leste
- Groups share ideas with the class, creating a mind map on the whiteboard

# Main Lesson Activities

## Interactive 16S rRNA Sequencing Simulation
- Use an online tool or software to simulate the 16S rRNA sequencing process
- Students follow along on their computers, learning each step of the process
- Pause for questions and discussions at key points

## Metagenomic Sequencing vs. 16S rRNA Debate
- Divide the class into two groups: one supporting 16S rRNA sequencing, the other supporting metagenomic sequencing
- Each group researches and presents arguments for their assigned method
- Class votes on which method they find more compelling for different research scenarios

## Bioinformatics Tool Showcase
- Demonstrate key features of popular bioinformatics tools (e.g., QIIME, mothur)
- Students take turns navigating the software interface and performing basic analyses

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Microbiome Data Analysis Challenge
- In pairs, students analyze a provided 16S rRNA dataset
- Tasks include:
  * Identifying the most abundant bacterial genera
  * Calculating alpha diversity
  * Creating a simple visualization of the data
- Pairs present their findings to another group for peer feedback

## Timor-Leste Microbiome Study Design
- In groups of 3-4, students design a hypothetical microbiome study relevant to a health issue in Timor-Leste
- Groups must:
  * Choose a research question
  * Select appropriate sequencing method
  * Outline basic study design and analysis plan
- Each group presents their study design to the class for discussion and feedback

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Microbiome Method Selection Quiz
- Present students with various research scenarios
- Students must choose the most appropriate microbiome research method for each scenario and justify their choice

## Bioinformatics Workflow Diagram
- Students create a flowchart illustrating the basic steps of microbiome data analysis
- Include key bioinformatics tools and their functions in the workflow

## Microbiome Vocabulary Crossword
- Create a crossword puzzle using key terms from the lesson
- Students complete the puzzle individually, reinforcing their understanding of important concepts

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Microbiome Research Technique Recap Race
- Divide the class into teams
- Each team races to list as many microbiome research techniques and tools as they can remember in 2 minutes
- Discuss and clarify any techniques that were missed or misunderstood

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the following prompt: "What do you think is the most promising application of microbiome research for improving health in Timor-Leste?"
- Volunteers share their thoughts with the class

## Microbiome Research in Timor-Leste Vision Board
- As a class, create a vision board for the future of microbiome research in Timor-Leste
- Students contribute ideas for potential studies, applications, and impacts
- Discuss how the techniques learned in this lesson could contribute to this vision
