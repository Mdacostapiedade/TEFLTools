# Warm-up Activities

## Microbiome Bingo
- Create bingo cards with various foods and activities that affect the gut microbiome
- Call out effects (e.g., "increases diversity," "promotes beneficial bacteria"), and students mark off corresponding items
- First to get a line wins and explains how each item affects the microbiome

## Gut Feeling Quiz
- Students answer true/false questions about the gut microbiome using colored cards
- Discuss the correct answers and common misconceptions as a class

# Main Lesson Activities

- Add cut-outs or drawings of different bacterial species in appropriate locations
- Label key functions of the gut microbiome in different areas

## Diet Detective
- Provide food logs from different individuals (including typical Timorese diets)
- Students analyze the diets and predict their impact on gut health
- Present findings to the class, discussing potential improvements

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Microbe Menu Makeover
- In pairs, students redesign a typical Timorese meal to be more microbiome-friendly
- Create a visual menu with explanations of how each item benefits gut health
- Share menus with the class and vote on the most creative and beneficial meal

## Gut Health Public Service Announcement

- Include key information, local food recommendations, and catchy slogans
- Perform PSAs for the class and discuss effective communication strategies

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Microbiome Diary
- Students keep a food and activity log for three days
- Analyze their own habits and write a reflection on potential impacts on their gut microbiome
- Develop a personal plan for improving gut health

## Bacterial Benefits Infographic
- Create an infographic showcasing the benefits of different gut bacteria
- Include information on what foods or activities promote each bacterial group
- Display infographics in the classroom and explain to peers

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities
