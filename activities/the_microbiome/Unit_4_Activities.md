# Warm-up Activities

## Microbiome True or False

1. Provide students with a list of true/false statements about the microbiome and immune system.
2. Students individually answer the questions.
3. Discuss answers as a class, addressing misconceptions.

Example statements:
- The microbiome only exists in the gut. (False)
- All bacteria in the body are harmful. (False)
- The microbiome plays a role in training the immune system. (True)

## Vocabulary Matching Game

1. Create cards with key vocabulary terms and their definitions.
2. Students work in pairs to match terms with definitions.
3. Review correct matches as a class.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Microbiome-Immune System Relationship Diagram

1. Provide students with a large sheet of paper and markers.
2. Students create a visual diagram showing the relationship between the microbiome and immune system.
3. Include key concepts like colonization resistance, immune tolerance, and mucosal immunity.

## Case Study Analysis

1. Present a case study of an infectious disease prevalent in Timor-Leste (e.g., tuberculosis).
2. Students analyze the case, identifying potential microbiome-immune system interactions.
3. Discuss findings as a class, highlighting the role of the microbiome in disease susceptibility and progression.

# Group Work Tasks

## Infectious Disease Presentation Preparation

1. Divide students into small groups.
2. Each group chooses an infectious disease relevant to Timor-Leste.
3. Groups research the relationship between their chosen disease and the microbiome.
4. Prepare a 5-minute presentation for the class.

## Public Health Message Development

1. In groups, students create a public health message about microbiome and immunity.
2. Design a poster or short video suitable for local dissemination in Timor-Leste.
3. Consider cultural context and appropriate language for the target audience.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Microbiome-Immune Axis Concept Map

1. Students individually create a concept map linking key terms and ideas from the lesson.
2. Include terms like colonization resistance, immune tolerance, pathobionts, and mucosal immunity.
3. Draw connections between concepts and briefly explain their relationships.

## Research Summary

1. Students choose a specific pathogen relevant to Timor-Leste.
2. Conduct brief research on how the microbiome influences the immune response to this pathogen.
3. Write a one-page summary of their findings.

# Cool-down Activities

## Microbiome Quiz Show

1. Divide the class into teams.
2. Host a quiz show-style game with questions about the microbiome and immune system.
3. Award points for correct answers and explanations.

## One-Minute Paper

1. At the end of the lesson, give students one minute to write down:
   - The most important thing they learned
   - One question they still have
2. Collect papers and address common questions or misconceptions in the next class.

## Microbiome Myth Busters

1. Provide students with common myths about the microbiome and immune system.
2. In pairs, students research and "bust" these myths.
3. Share findings with the class, promoting critical thinking about microbiome science.
