# Warm-up Activities

## Water Source Speculation

1. Display images of different water sources in Timor-Leste (well, river, tap).
2. Students discuss in pairs:
   - Which source they'd prefer to drink from and why
   - What invisible organisms might be present in each source
3. Share responses as a class, introducing microbes in water.

## Microbe Pictionary

1. Divide class into small groups.
2. Each group draws a microbe-related term (e.g., bacteria, virus, fungus).
3. Groups take turns drawing their term while others guess.
4. Discuss how these microbes relate to the microbiome.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Water Quality Testing Station

1. Set up stations with water samples from different sources.
2. Students rotate through stations, testing water quality.
3. Record results and discuss implications for microbiome health.

## Urban vs. Rural Microbiome Mapping

1. Provide large maps of Timor-Leste.
2. Students color-code urban and rural areas.
3. In groups, brainstorm and add environmental factors that might influence the microbiome in each area.
4. Present findings to the class.

## Sanitation Impact Simulation

1. Create a simple board game representing a community.
2. Students roll dice to determine sanitation improvements or setbacks.
3. Track changes in community health and discuss microbiome implications.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Environmental Intervention Design Challenge

1. Divide class into groups of 3-4.
2. Assign each group a focus area: water quality, sanitation, or urban/rural differences.
3. Groups design an intervention to improve their assigned factor.
4. Create a poster outlining the intervention and its expected impact on the microbiome.
5. Present posters to the class.

## Microbiome Influence Web

1. In pairs, students create a web diagram.
2. Center the web with "Timor-Leste Microbiome".
3. Add branches for different environmental influences.
4. Connect and explain relationships between factors.
5. Share and compare webs with other pairs.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Microbiome Journal

1. Students create a daily log for one week.
2. Record environmental exposures that might affect their microbiome.
3. Reflect on potential positive and negative impacts.
4. Write a summary of insights gained.

## Water Source Analysis

1. Provide data on water quality from different Timor-Leste sources.
2. Students analyze the data individually.
3. Write a short report on how each source might impact the microbiome.
4. Recommend improvements for each water source.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Microbiome Myth Busters

1. Present common myths about microbes and the environment.
2. Students vote on whether each statement is true or false.
3. Discuss the correct answers and their implications.

## One Thing I Learned, One Question I Have

1. Students write on two sticky notes:
   - One new thing they learned about environmental influences on the microbiome
   - One question they still have
2. Place notes on designated areas of the classroom.
3. Briefly discuss common themes in learnings and questions.

## Microbiome Protection Pledge

1. Students individually write a pledge to protect their microbiome.
2. Include one action they'll take to improve their environmental exposure.
3. Share pledges in small groups.
4. Volunteer to read pledges aloud to the class.
