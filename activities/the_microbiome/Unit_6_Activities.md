# Warm-up Activities

## Microbiome Myth Busters
- Present students with common myths about pregnancy and infant health.
- Students discuss in pairs whether they think each statement is true or false.
- Reveal the correct answers, connecting each to microbiome concepts.

## Pregnancy Journey Timeline
- Create a large timeline on the wall representing the 9 months of pregnancy.
- Students add sticky notes with their ideas about changes occurring during pregnancy.
- Highlight notes related to microbiome changes for further discussion.

# Main Lesson Activities

## Microbiome Map
- Students create a visual map of the body, marking key areas where microbiome changes occur during pregnancy.
- Add arrows to show how these changes might affect maternal and fetal health.

## Birth Scenario Stations
- Set up stations around the room representing different birth scenarios (e.g., vaginal birth, C-section, home birth, hospital birth).
- Students rotate through stations, discussing how each scenario might impact the infant's microbiome.

## Breastfeeding Benefits Brainstorm
- In small groups, students brainstorm all the benefits of breastfeeding they can think of.
- Groups share their lists, with the instructor highlighting microbiome-related benefits.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Cultural Practice Investigation
- Pairs research a specific cultural practice related to pregnancy or childbirth in Timor-Leste.
- Groups analyze the practice's potential impact on the microbiome and present findings to the class.

## Microbiome-Friendly Menu Planning
- Groups design a week-long menu for pregnant women in Timor-Leste that supports a healthy microbiome.
- Consider local ingredients, cultural preferences, and nutritional needs.

## Birth Plan Comparison
- Provide groups with sample birth plans from different cultures.
- Students compare and contrast the plans, focusing on elements that might affect the microbiome.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Microbiome Development Timeline
- Students create a timeline of infant microbiome development from birth to 2 years old.
- Include key events like introduction of solid foods and common childhood illnesses.

## Case Study Analysis
- Provide a case study of a pregnant woman in Timor-Leste with specific health concerns.
- Students write a short report on how microbiome considerations could inform her care plan.

## Reflection Journal
- Students write a personal reflection on how their understanding of pregnancy and infant health has changed after learning about the microbiome.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Microbiome Message in a Bottle
- Students write a brief message to their future selves about the most important thing they learned about the maternal and infant microbiome.
- Place messages in a "time capsule" to be opened at the end of the course.

## One-Minute Paper
- Students have one minute to write down the most surprising thing they learned about the microbiome in maternal and child health.
- Share responses anonymously and discuss as a class.

## Microbiome Mingle
- Students mingle around the room, sharing one key concept they learned with each person they meet.
- The goal is to collect as many unique ideas as possible in a set time.
