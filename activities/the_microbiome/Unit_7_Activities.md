# Warm-up Activities

## Microbiome-NCD Match Game
- Prepare cards with NCDs on one set and microbiome-related factors on another
- Students work in pairs to match NCDs with potential microbiome connections
- Discuss correct answers as a class

## NCD Experience Sharing
- Students form small groups and share personal experiences or knowledge of NCDs in their families or communities
- Each group summarizes key points to share with the class

# Main Lesson Activities

## Microbiome-NCD Connection Map
- Students create a visual map showing connections between the microbiome and various NCDs
- Use different colors to represent different types of connections (e.g., causative, correlative)

## Gut-Brain Axis Roleplay
- Assign students roles as different components of the gut-brain axis (e.g., gut bacteria, neurotransmitters, vagus nerve)
- Act out the communication process between the gut and brain

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Case Study Analysis
- Provide groups with case studies of NCD patients
- Groups identify potential microbiome factors contributing to the condition
- Develop a microbiome-based intervention plan for the patient

## Community Workshop Planning
- Divide class into groups to develop components of a community workshop on microbiome and NCD prevention:
  * Create an informational poster
  * Design an interactive activity
  * Develop key talking points for presentation

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Microbiome Intervention Proposal
- Students choose an NCD prevalent in Timor-Leste
- Research its connections to the microbiome
- Write a brief proposal for a culturally appropriate microbiome-based intervention

## NCD-Microbiome Fact Sheet
- Create a one-page fact sheet on a specific NCD and its microbiome connections
- Include key facts, statistics relevant to Timor-Leste, and practical tips for maintaining a healthy microbiome

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Microbiome-NCD Quiz Bowl
- Divide class into teams
- Host a quick quiz game with questions covering the main points of the lesson
- Award points for correct answers and explanations

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the most important thing they learned about microbiome and NCDs
- Share responses with a partner and then with the class

## Microbiome Action Plan
- Students create a personal action plan for supporting their microbiome health
- Include specific, achievable steps relevant to their daily lives in Timor-Leste
