# Warm-up Activities

## Probiotic Food Tasting
- Provide small samples of various probiotic foods (yogurt, kefir, kombucha)
- Students taste and describe flavors, textures, and their overall impressions
- Discuss any similar fermented foods in Timorese cuisine

## Microbiome Myth Busters
- Display common myths about probiotics and the microbiome
- Students vote on whether each statement is true or false
- Reveal correct answers and briefly explain the science behind each

# Main Lesson Activities

## Microbiome Therapy Timeline
- Create a large timeline on the classroom wall
- Students research key events in the development of microbiome-based therapies
- Add events to the timeline and discuss their significance

## Probiotic Strain Match-Up
- Provide cards with probiotic strain names and their potential health benefits
- Students work in pairs to match strains with their associated benefits
- Discuss the importance of strain-specific effects in probiotics

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## FMT Case Study Analysis
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group receives a case study of a patient treated with FMT
- Groups analyze the case, discussing benefits, risks, and ethical considerations
- Present findings to the class

## Prebiotic Food Web
- In pairs, students research prebiotic foods and their effects on gut bacteria
- Create a visual "food web" showing connections between prebiotics and beneficial bacteria
- Share and explain their food webs to other pairs

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Microbiome Intervention Proposal
- Students individually draft a one-page proposal for a microbiome-based intervention in Timor-Leste
- Proposals should address a specific health issue and consider local cultural context
- Peer review proposals in small groups

## Probiotic Product Label Analysis
- Provide students with various probiotic product labels
- Individually analyze labels for key information (strains, CFU count, health claims)
- Write a short report on the strengths and weaknesses of each product's labeling

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Microbiome Therapy Concept Map
- As a class, create a large concept map on the board
- Include key terms and concepts from the lesson (probiotics, prebiotics, FMT, etc.)
- Students take turns adding connections and explaining relationships between concepts

## One-Minute Paper
- Students write for one minute on the following prompt:
  "What is the most interesting thing you learned about microbiome-based therapies today, and why?"
- Share responses with a partner or in small groups
- Discuss any remaining questions or areas of confusion as a class
