# Warm-up Activities

## Time Value Auction
1. Give each student 5 "time credits"
2. List various tasks on the board (e.g., "teach a skill", "cook a meal", "fix a bicycle")
3. Students bid their time credits on tasks they'd like to receive
4. Discuss: How did you decide which tasks were most valuable?

## Quote Analysis
1. Display quotes about time and money (e.g., "Time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time." - Jim Rohn)
2. Students discuss in pairs: What does this mean for how we value time in society?
3. Share insights with the class

# Main Lesson Activities

## Time Banking Simulation
1. Assign each student a skill or service they can offer
2. Set up a mock time bank board where students can post offers and requests
3. Allow students to make exchanges, keeping track of time credits earned and spent
4. Debrief: What was easy or difficult about this system?

## Concept Mapping
1. In small groups, create a concept map of time banking principles
2. Include key terms: reciprocity, equality, community building, co-production
3. Groups present their maps, explaining connections between concepts

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Cultural Connection
1. In pairs, research a traditional Timorese practice that embodies time banking principles
2. Create a short presentation comparing the practice to modern time banking
3. Present findings to another pair, then to the whole class

## Time Bank Design Challenge
1. In groups of 4-5, design a time bank for a specific community in Timor-Leste
2. Consider: What services would be exchanged? How would you recruit members?
3. Create a poster outlining your time bank design
4. Gallery walk: Groups view and provide feedback on each other's designs

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Reflection Journal
1. Students write a personal reflection on how time banking could impact their life
2. Prompt: "If you joined a time bank, what services would you offer? What would you hope to receive?"

## Case Study Analysis
1. Provide a short case study of a successful time bank in another country
2. Students analyze the case, answering questions about its structure, benefits, and challenges
3. Write a brief report on how this model could be adapted for Timor-Leste

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## One-Minute Paper
1. Students write for one minute on: "What's the most interesting thing you learned about time banking today?"
2. Share responses with a partner
3. Volunteers share with the whole class

## Time Banking Pledge
1. Students write one way they could incorporate time banking principles into their daily life
2. Share pledges anonymously by posting them on a class "Time Bank Wall"
3. Read a few aloud and discuss as a class how these small actions could create change

## Exit Ticket Quiz
1. Students answer 3-5 quick questions about key time banking concepts on a slip of paper
2. Collect as they leave class to assess understanding and inform future lessons
