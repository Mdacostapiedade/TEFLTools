# Main Lesson Activities

## Implementation Strategy Jigsaw

1. Divide the class into expert groups, each focusing on one aspect of time bank implementation:
   - Community needs assessment
   - Stakeholder engagement
   - Operational procedures
   - Technology adaptation
2. Expert groups research their topic and create a brief presentation.
3. Regroup students into mixed teams to share knowledge from each expert group.
4. Teams synthesize information to create a comprehensive implementation strategy.

## Cultural Challenge Scenarios

1. Present various scenarios that highlight potential cultural challenges in implementing time banking in Timor-Leste.
2. Students work in pairs to develop solutions for each scenario.
3. Pairs present their solutions to the class for feedback and discussion.

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Stakeholder Mapping

1. In small groups, create a stakeholder map for a time bank in a specific Timorese community.
2. Identify key stakeholders, their interests, and potential roles in the time bank.
3. Develop strategies for engaging each stakeholder group.
4. Present stakeholder maps to the class, comparing different approaches.

## Outreach Campaign Design

2. Assign each group a specific demographic in Timor-Leste (e.g., rural farmers, urban youth, elderly).
3. Groups design an outreach campaign to introduce time banking to their assigned demographic.
4. Create a poster or digital presentation showcasing the campaign.
5. Gallery walk to view and provide feedback on each campaign.

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Time Bank Software Simulation

4. Reflect on the user experience and potential adaptations needed for Timor-Leste.

## Implementation Plan Draft

1. Students individually draft a basic implementation plan for a time bank in their local community.
2. Include sections on community assessment, stakeholder engagement, operational procedures, and technology considerations.
3. Peer review plans in pairs, providing constructive feedback.

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Implementation Strategy Gallery

1. Display the implementation strategies created during the main lesson activity.
2. Students use sticky notes to leave comments, questions, or suggestions on each strategy.
3. Discuss common themes, innovative ideas, and areas for improvement as a class.

## Reflection Web

1. Create a web diagram on the board with "Time Banking in Timor-Leste" in the center.
