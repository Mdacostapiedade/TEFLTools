# Warm-up Activities

## UBI Cost Estimation Game
- Divide the class into small groups
- Provide each group with Timor-Leste's population and GDP data
- Challenge groups to estimate the cost of UBI as a percentage of GDP
- Groups present their estimates and reasoning
- Reveal the actual figures and discuss discrepancies

## Funding Source Brainstorm
- Individual students write down potential funding sources for UBI in Timor-Leste
- Share ideas in pairs, then with the whole class
- Create a mind map on the board with all suggested funding sources

# Main Lesson Activities

## Interactive Lecture: UBI Cost Scenarios
- Present different UBI amount scenarios using interactive slides
- Students use calculators to compute total costs in real-time
- Discuss implications of each scenario on Timor-Leste's budget

## Macroeconomic Effects Simulation
- Use a simple economic simulation tool to demonstrate potential effects of UBI on inflation, consumption, and savings
- Students adjust variables and observe outcomes
- Discuss the results and their implications for Timor-Leste

# Group Work Tasks

## Funding Source Analysis
- Divide class into groups, each assigned a potential funding source (e.g., oil revenues, new taxes, foreign aid)
- Groups analyze the viability and sustainability of their assigned source
- Create a presentation outlining pros, cons, and recommendations

## UBI Budget Proposal Development
- Groups develop a comprehensive UBI budget proposal for Timor-Leste
- Include UBI amount, total cost, funding sources, and economic rationale
- Present proposals to the class for peer feedback and discussion

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Cost Calculation Worksheet
- Provide students with a worksheet containing various UBI scenarios
- Students calculate total costs and percentage of GDP for each scenario
- Include questions on potential economic impacts for each scenario

## Funding Source Evaluation
- Students individually evaluate one potential funding source for UBI
- Write a brief report on its feasibility, sustainability, and potential economic impacts
- Include recommendations for implementation or alternatives

# Cool-down Activities

## UBI Implementation Timeline
- As a class, create a hypothetical timeline for UBI implementation in Timor-Leste
- Discuss potential milestones, challenges, and necessary preparations
- Reflect on the complexity of implementing such a program

## Reflection Questions
- Students write brief responses to reflection questions:
  1. What surprised you most about the fiscal implications of UBI?
  2. How might UBI affect different sectors of Timor-Leste's economy?
  3. What do you think is the biggest challenge in funding UBI in Timor-Leste?
- Share responses in pairs or small groups

## Key Takeaways Gallery Walk
- Post flip charts around the room with different aspects of the lesson (e.g., costs, funding sources, economic effects)
- Students circulate and write key takeaways on each chart
- Conclude by reviewing and discussing the compiled takeaways as a class
