- Divide class into expert groups focusing on different aspects of UBI design:
  1. Payment amount and frequency
  2. Eligibility criteria
  3. Funding mechanisms
  4. Implementation logistics
- Expert groups research their topic and prepare a short presentation
- Regroup into mixed teams with one expert from each topic to share knowledge

## 2. Implementation Challenge Case Studies (25 minutes)

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Solution Stations (30 minutes)
- Set up stations around the room, each focusing on a specific implementation challenge
- Pairs or small groups rotate through stations, brainstorming solutions for each challenge
- Groups leave their ideas at each station for the next group to build upon

## 2. Policy Design Debate (20 minutes)
- Divide class into groups representing different stakeholders (government, citizens, NGOs, etc.)

- Hold a mock policy debate where groups present and defend their proposals

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Rapid Research Race (15 minutes)
- Provide a list of key questions about UBI implementation in Timor-Leste
- Students use laptops/tablets to find reliable sources and answers as quickly as possible
- Review answers as a class, discussing the quality and reliability of sources

## 2. Policy Brief Outline (20 minutes)
- Students create an outline for their UBI implementation policy brief
- Include sections on key design features, implementation challenges, and monitoring strategies
- Peer review outlines in pairs, providing feedback and suggestions

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. UBI Implementation Roadmap (10 minutes)
- As a class, create a visual roadmap of the UBI implementation process for Timor-Leste
- Include key milestones, potential obstacles, and success indicators
- Discuss the feasibility and timeline of the roadmap

## 2. Reflection Corners (5 minutes)
- Label corners of the room with different emotions or reactions (excited, skeptical, curious, concerned)
