### Master Weaver Masterclass
- Invite a local master weaver for an interactive demonstration
- Students take turns assisting the master weaver
- Encourage students to ask questions and take notes

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Motif Design Workshop
- In pairs, students create a new motif inspired by traditional designs
- Pairs swap designs and provide feedback
- Groups present their final designs to the class, explaining their inspiration

### Weaving Technique Rotation
- Set up stations for different weaving techniques
- Pairs rotate through stations, practicing each technique
- Partners teach each other and provide feedback

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Personal Tais Project
- Each student begins a small tais-inspired project
- Incorporate at least one traditional motif
- Regular check-ins with instructor for guidance and feedback

### Weaving Journal
- Students maintain a weaving journal throughout the course
- Record observations, sketches of motifs, and reflections on techniques learned
- Include samples of yarns and small woven swatches

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### Weaving Word Web
- As a class, create a word web on the board
- Start with "Tais" in the center
- Students add related terms, techniques, and concepts learned in the lesson

### Tais Show and Tell
- Students display their work-in-progress tais projects
- Brief presentation on their design choices and challenges faced
- Peer feedback and appreciation session

### Weaving Wisdom Circle
- Form a circle with the class
- Pass around a shuttle or other weaving tool
- Each student shares one thing they learned or found interesting about Timorese weaving

These activities are designed to reinforce key concepts, engage students in hands-on learning, and promote both individual and collaborative work. They also incorporate cultural aspects of Timorese weaving, helping to connect students with their heritage while learning new skills.
