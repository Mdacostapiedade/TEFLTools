Here's a set of engaging activities for the lesson on Designing Woven Textiles, formatted in Markdown:

# Engaging Activities for Designing Woven Textiles

## 1. Warm-up Activities

### Pattern Scavenger Hunt (10 minutes)
- Divide students into pairs.
- Give each pair a collection of Timorese textile images.
- Challenge them to find and sketch as many unique patterns as they can in 5 minutes.
- Have pairs share their favorite pattern with the class, explaining why they chose it.

### Color Harmony Speed Dating (10 minutes)
- Assign each student a color.
- Have students "speed date" by pairing up for 30 seconds at a time.
- In each pairing, students must quickly decide if their colors are complementary, analogous, or neither.
- After several rounds, discuss which color combinations were most appealing.

## 2. Main Lesson Activities

### Draft Detective (20 minutes)
- Provide students with a simple woven fabric sample and its corresponding draft.
- Guide them through analyzing how the draft translates to the actual fabric.
- Challenge students to identify the threading, tie-up, and treadling in the draft.

### Color Theory in Action (25 minutes)
- Present a traditional Timorese textile with a distinctive color scheme.
- Demonstrate how to analyze the color relationships using a color wheel.
- Have students create three alternative color schemes for the same pattern: one using complementary colors, one using analogous colors, and one using a triad.

## 3. Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

### Modernize a Motif (30 minutes)
- Divide the class into small groups.
- Assign each group a traditional Timorese motif.
- Challenge them to create a modernized version of the motif, considering:
  * Simplification of lines
  * Color palette update
  * Potential applications (e.g., fashion, home decor)
- Have groups present their modernized motifs to the class.

### Collaborative Draft Creation (25 minutes)
- In pairs, have students create a weaving draft for a small project (e.g., a coaster or placemat).
- One student focuses on the threading and tie-up, while the other works on the treadling and color selection.
- Encourage pairs to combine traditional elements with modern design ideas.

## 4. Individual Practice Exercises

### Personal Color Palette Development (15 minutes)
- Have each student select a personal item (e.g., favorite piece of clothing, photo of their home).
- Guide them in creating a color palette inspired by their chosen item.
- Ask students to apply this palette to a simple weave draft.

### Motif Adaptation Sketch (20 minutes)
- Provide students with a selection of traditional Timorese motifs.
- Ask each student to choose one motif and create three quick sketches adapting it:
  1. A simplified version
  2. A version with added elements
  3. A version that combines it with a different motif

## 5. Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

### Design Gallery Walk (15 minutes)
- Have students display their drafts and color palettes around the room.
- Conduct a silent gallery walk where students observe each other's work.
- Provide sticky notes for students to leave positive feedback or questions on their peers' designs.

### Reflection Circle (10 minutes)
- Form a circle with the entire class.
- Pass around a ball of yarn.
- When a student receives the yarn, they share one thing they learned or found challenging about designing woven textiles.
- As they pass the yarn, it creates a web, visually representing the connections in their learning.

These activities are designed to reinforce key concepts of weaving drafts, color theory, and adapting traditional motifs while engaging students through varied, interactive tasks.
