# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Compass Rose Race
- Divide the class into teams
- Draw a large compass rose on the ground
- Call out directions (e.g., "Northwest!")
- Teams race to send one member to stand on the correct point
- First team to reach the correct point scores a point

## 2. Map Symbol Charades
- Prepare cards with common map symbols
- Students take turns drawing a card and acting out the symbol
- Other students guess the map feature being represented

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Topographic Map 3D Model
- Provide students with a topographic map section and modeling clay
- Students create a 3D model of the terrain based on contour lines
- Discuss how topographic features appear on maps vs. in real life

## 2. Compass Treasure Hunt
- Hide objects around the school grounds
- Provide students with a list of compass bearings and distances
- Students use compasses to locate the hidden objects

## 3. Southern Cross Simulator
- Use a darkened room or planetarium software
- Project the Southern Hemisphere night sky
- Guide students through locating the Southern Cross and finding south
- Rotate the sky to show how the position changes throughout the night

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Natural Navigation Challenge
- Assign each group a different natural navigation method (e.g., sun position, wind patterns, tree growth)
- Groups research their method and create a short presentation
- Groups teach their method to the rest of the class

## 2. Map and Compass Relay
- Set up a course with multiple checkpoints
- Teams work in pairs to navigate from point to point using map and compass
- Each pair completes one leg of the course before passing the map and compass to the next pair

## 3. Celestial Navigation Puzzle
- Provide groups with images of the night sky at different times and locations in Timor-Leste
- Groups must determine the approximate time and direction based on star positions
- Discuss findings and strategies as a class

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Contour Line Interpretation
- Provide students with various topographic map sections
- Students identify the highest and lowest points, steep slopes, and flat areas
- Students draw a profile of a specific line across the map

## 2. Compass Bearing Worksheet
- Give students a map with various landmarks marked
- Students calculate and record the bearing from a central point to each landmark
- Check accuracy using a compass rose overlay

## 3. Natural Indicator Observation Journal
- Students spend time outside observing and recording natural direction indicators
- Each student creates a field guide page for one specific indicator (e.g., sun position, moss growth)

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Navigation Method Pros and Cons
- Create a chart on the board listing all navigation methods covered
- Students contribute pros and cons for each method
- Discuss which methods are most reliable in different scenarios

## 2. Navigation Storytelling
- Students write a short story or scenario incorporating at least three navigation techniques learned
- Volunteers share their stories with the class

## 3. Real-World Application Discussion
- Brainstorm situations where these navigation skills might be useful in students' lives
- Discuss how traditional navigation knowledge can be preserved and valued in modern Timor-Leste
