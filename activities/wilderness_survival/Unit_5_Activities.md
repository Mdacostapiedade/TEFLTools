# Warm-up Activities

## Water Source Scavenger Hunt
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a local map
- Challenge groups to identify and list as many potential water sources as they can in 5 minutes
- Discuss findings as a class, highlighting safe and unsafe sources

## Water Purity Perception Test
- Present students with clear glasses of water from different sources (tap, filtered, bottled, etc.)
- Ask students to rank the waters from "most pure" to "least pure" based on appearance
- Reveal the actual sources and discuss how appearance can be deceiving in water safety

# Main Lesson Activities

## Water Contaminant Demonstration
- Use a clear container of water and add various "contaminants" (dirt, leaves, food coloring)
- Discuss how each contaminant represents different types of water pollution
- Explain the potential health risks associated with each type of contamination

## Purification Method Stations
- Set up stations for different purification methods (boiling, chemical treatment, filtration, SODIS)
- Rotate small groups through each station
- At each station, demonstrate the method and have students practice the technique

## Water Testing Workshop
- Provide water samples from different sources
- Teach students how to use basic water testing kits
- Have students test samples and record results
- Discuss the implications of the test results

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## DIY Water Filter Challenge
- In pairs or small groups, provide materials (sand, gravel, charcoal, cloth, bottles)
- Challenge students to design and construct their own water filters
- Test the filters with "dirty" water and compare results between groups

## Purification Method Debate
- Assign each group a different purification method
- Have groups research and prepare arguments for why their method is the best
- Conduct a class debate on the pros and cons of each method

## Community Water Source Mapping
- In groups, assign different areas of the local community
- Have students create detailed maps of water sources in their assigned areas
- Combine group findings to create a comprehensive community water source map

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Purification Method Flowchart
- Have each student create a flowchart detailing the steps for one purification method
- Encourage creativity in presentation (drawings, diagrams, etc.)

## Water Safety Journal
- Provide students with a week-long journal template
- Ask them to record their daily water sources and any purification methods used
- Have them reflect on their water usage and safety practices

## Contamination Scenario Problem-Solving
- Present students with various water contamination scenarios
- Ask them to write out step-by-step solutions for making the water safe to drink

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Water Purification Charades
- Write different purification methods on slips of paper
- Have students take turns acting out the methods while others guess

## One-Minute Water Wisdom
- Give each student one minute to share the most important thing they learned about water safety

## Water Safety Pledge
- As a class, create a water safety pledge
- Have each student sign the pledge and commit to practicing safe water habits

## Quick Quiz
- Conduct a rapid-fire quiz on key concepts from the lesson
- Use raised hands or small whiteboards for quick responses
