# Warm-up Activities

## Shelter Scenario Challenge
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a unique scenario (e.g., "You're stranded on a Timorese beach during monsoon season")
- Groups have 5 minutes to sketch and describe a shelter design for their scenario
- Each group presents their design to the class, explaining their choices

## Material Matching Game
- Create cards with names and images of local shelter-building materials
- Students work in pairs to match the names with the correct images
- Discuss the properties and uses of each material as a class

# Main Lesson Activities

## Shelter Site Selection Simulation
- Set up an outdoor area with various "terrain features" (using props or natural landscape)
- Students navigate the area in small groups, identifying and marking ideal shelter locations
- Groups explain their choices, considering factors like drainage, wind protection, and resource proximity

## Traditional vs. Modern Shelter Comparison
- Display images of traditional Timorese shelters and modern bushcraft designs
- Students create a Venn diagram comparing and contrasting the two styles
- Class discussion on how to blend traditional and modern techniques

## Tropical Shelter Design Workshop
- Provide students with a list of tropical climate challenges (heavy rain, high humidity, insects)
- In groups, students design a shelter that addresses these challenges
- Groups create a poster explaining their design features and present to the class

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Mini-Shelter Building Challenge
- Divide class into pairs or small groups
- Provide each group with a set of materials (sticks, leaves, cordage)
- Groups have 20 minutes to construct a small-scale shelter model
- Peer evaluation of shelters based on stability, weather resistance, and creativity

## Knot-Tying Relay Race
- Form teams of 4-5 students
- Set up stations with different knot-tying challenges (clove hitch, square lashing, etc.)
- Teams race to complete all knot challenges correctly
- First team to finish with all knots properly tied wins

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Shelter Component Sketching
- Students individually sketch and label key components of a tropical shelter (ridgepole, support beams, thatching, etc.)
- Include brief explanations of each component's function

## Personal Shelter Design Project
- Each student creates a detailed design for a shelter suited to a specific Timorese environment (coastal, mountain, jungle)
- Designs should include materials list, construction steps, and adaptations for local climate

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Shelter Building Trivia Game
- Create a quiz with questions covering key concepts from the lesson
- Students compete individually or in teams to answer correctly
- Award points for correct answers and explanations

## Reflection Circle
- Form a circle with the entire class
- Pass around a "talking stick" (could be a local plant or craft item)
- Each student shares one new thing they learned about shelter building and one question they still have

## Future Shelter Innovations
- Students brainstorm ideas for innovative shelter designs that combine traditional Timorese techniques with modern technology
- Share ideas with the class and discuss their potential applications in wilderness survival or disaster relief scenarios
