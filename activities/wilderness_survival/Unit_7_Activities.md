# Warm-up Activities

## Plant Identification Race
- Divide students into teams
- Display various local plants or high-quality images
- Teams race to correctly identify as many edible plants as possible in 5 minutes
- Discuss results and common identification features

## Edible or Not?
- Show students a series of plants (or images) one at a time
- Students vote by standing on one side of the room for "edible" and the other for "not edible"
- Reveal the correct answer and discuss key identification features

# Main Lesson Activities

## Foraging Scavenger Hunt
- Create a list of edible plants commonly found in the local area
- Provide students with the list and send them on a supervised hunt to find and photograph (not collect) the plants
- Review findings as a group, discussing identification features and habitat preferences

## Sustainable Harvesting Demonstration
- Select a few abundant edible plants in the teaching area
- Demonstrate proper harvesting techniques for each plant type
- Have students practice the techniques under supervision
- Discuss how these methods promote sustainability

## Traditional Uses Storytelling
- Invite a local elder or expert to share stories about traditional plant uses in Timorese culture
- Encourage students to ask questions and take notes
- Follow up with a group discussion on how traditional knowledge can inform modern foraging practices

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## Foraging Ethics Scenario Cards
- Create cards with various foraging scenarios (e.g., finding a rare plant, foraging on private property)
- In pairs or small groups, students discuss the ethical considerations and decide on the best course of action
- Groups present their decisions to the class for further discussion

## Plant Identification Teach-Back
- Assign each group a different edible plant to research
- Groups prepare a short presentation on their plant, including identification features, uses, and harvesting methods
- Each group teaches the class about their assigned plant

## Recipe Development Challenge
- Provide groups with a list of locally foraged ingredients
- Challenge them to develop a recipe using at least three of the ingredients
- Groups present their recipes, explaining the nutritional benefits and cultural significance of the ingredients

# Individual Practice Exercises

## Personal Field Guide Entry
- Students choose one edible plant from the lesson
- Create a detailed field guide entry including:
  * Scientific and common names
  * Illustration or photograph
  * Key identification features
  * Habitat and growing season
  * Traditional and modern uses
  * Proper harvesting techniques

## Foraging Journal Reflection
- Students write a reflective journal entry on their foraging experience, addressing:
  * New plants they learned to identify
  * Challenges they faced in identification or harvesting
  * How foraging connects them to nature and Timorese culture
  * Ideas for incorporating foraged foods into their diet

## Plant Use Mind Map
- Students create a mind map for one edible plant, branching out to show:
  * Culinary uses
  * Medicinal properties
  * Traditional cultural significance
  * Ecological role in the local environment

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## Foraging Wisdom Circle
- Form a circle and pass around a "talking stick"
- Each student shares one important thing they learned about foraging or one way they plan to apply their new knowledge

## Edible Plant Pictionary
- Divide the class into teams
- One member from each team takes turns drawing an edible plant while their team tries to guess the plant
- Discuss any interesting features or uses of the plants after they are guessed

## Foraging Future Visioning
- Guide students through a brief visualization exercise imagining how they might use their foraging skills in the future
- Students share their visions with a partner or the whole group
- Discuss how foraging skills can contribute to personal and community resilience
