# Warm-up Activities

## 1. Identity Peeling

- Students form pairs
- Partner A asks Partner B "Who are you?" repeatedly for 2 minutes
- Partner B responds each time, trying to go deeper with each answer
- Partners switch roles and repeat
- Class discussion: How did your answers change? What did you discover?

## 2. Awareness Scavenger Hunt

- Students walk around the room for 3 minutes
- They must find and silently observe:
  * 3 things they've never noticed before
  * 2 sounds they usually ignore
  * 1 bodily sensation they weren't aware of
- Share discoveries with a partner

# Main Lesson Activities

## 1. Self-Inquiry Stations

- Set up 4 stations around the room, each with a different self-inquiry method:
  1. Questioning thoughts
  2. Observing the witness
  3. Tracing thoughts to their source
  4. "Who am I?" contemplation
- Students rotate through stations, spending 5 minutes at each
- They record insights in their journals

## 2. Obstacle Course of Self-Realization

- Create a physical "obstacle course" representing common barriers to self-realization
- Students navigate the course while reflecting on how to overcome each obstacle
- Obstacles could include:
  * "Identification with body" (mirror station)
  * "Attachment to desires" (table with tempting objects)
  * "Habitual thought patterns" (maze or puzzle)

# Group Work or Pair Work Tasks

## 1. Self-Inquiry Dialogue

- In pairs, students take turns being the "inquirer" and the "responder"
- Inquirer asks probing questions about the responder's beliefs and identity
- Responder practices staying aware of their reactions and thoughts
- Switch roles after 10 minutes

## 2. Mind Map Collaboration

- In groups of 3-4, create a large mind map of the self-inquiry process
- Include methods, obstacles, benefits, and daily life applications
- Present mind maps to the class, explaining key connections

# Individual Practice Exercises

## 1. Witness Consciousness Meditation

- 10-minute guided meditation focusing on being the witness of thoughts and sensations
- Students mentally label experiences as they arise: "thinking," "feeling," "hearing," etc.
- Journal reflections on the experience afterward

## 2. "Who Am I?" Journaling

- 15 minutes of silent, stream-of-consciousness writing in response to "Who am I?"
- Encourage students to question each statement they write
- Highlight insights and recurring themes

# Cool-down or Wrap-up Activities

## 1. Self-Inquiry Commitment Circle

- Students stand in a circle
- Each person shares one way they'll incorporate self-inquiry into their daily life
- As each person shares, they hold a ball of yarn and then pass it to someone across the circle
- By the end, a web is formed, symbolizing interconnectedness and shared commitment

## 2. Awareness Bell

- Ring a bell or chime at random intervals during the last 5 minutes of class
- When the bell sounds, students pause and briefly note their current state of awareness
- Discuss: How did this practice affect your moment-to-moment experience?
