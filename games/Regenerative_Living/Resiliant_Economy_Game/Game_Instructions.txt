Local Economy Simulation Game: "Resilient Timor"

Objective: 
To simulate a local economy in Timor-Leste, encouraging players to collaborate, trade, and adapt to challenges while building community resilience.

Players: 
20-30 students, divided into 5-6 groups of 4-5 players each.

Duration: 
90 minutes (60 minutes for gameplay, 30 minutes for debrief)

Materials:
- Resource cards (representing various goods and services)
- Need cards (representing what each group must acquire)
- Event cards (for introducing "shocks")
- Play money (representing the local currency)
- Dice
- Timer

Setup:

1. Divide players into the following groups:
   - Farmers
   - Fisherfolk
   - Artisans
   - Traders
   - Service Providers
   - Government Officials (optional, for larger groups)

2. Provide each group with:
   - A set of resource cards specific to their sector
   - A set of need cards representing what they must acquire
   - An initial amount of play money

3. Set up a central "marketplace" area where trades can occur.

Rules:

1. The game is played in rounds, each representing a month. Aim for 6-8 rounds.

2. At the beginning of each round, groups assess their resources and needs.

3. Groups have 5 minutes to strategize and then 5 minutes to negotiate and trade in the marketplace.

4. Trades can involve bartering resources, buying with play money, or a combination of both.

5. At the end of the trading period, groups check if they've met their needs for the round.

6. After trading, roll a die. If a 6 is rolled, draw an event card and apply its effects.

7. Groups that meet all their needs in a round gain 5 "resilience points." Partially met needs earn fewer points.

8. The game continues for the set number of rounds or until time runs out.

9. The group with the most resilience points at the end wins, but emphasis should be on overall community resilience.

Specific Group Instructions:

1. Farmers:
   - Resources: Crops, livestock
   - Needs: Fishing equipment, crafted goods, healthcare

2. Fisherfolk:
   - Resources: Fish, seafood
   - Needs: Agricultural products, boat repairs, education

3. Artisans:
   - Resources: Crafted goods (e.g., textiles, pottery)
   - Needs: Raw materials, tools, food

4. Traders:
   - Resources: Varied goods, information about market trends
   - Needs: Local products to trade, transportation services

5. Service Providers:
   - Resources: Healthcare, education, repairs
   - Needs: Food, crafted goods, building materials

6. Government Officials (if included):
   - Resources: Infrastructure projects, regulations
   - Needs: Taxes, community support

Event Cards Examples:

1. Drought: Farmers' crop yields are halved this round.
2. Fishing Boom: Fisherfolk resources are doubled this round.
3. Tourist Influx: Demand for crafted goods increases; artisans can sell at higher prices.
4. Economic Downturn: All money values are worth 25% less this round.
5. Community Festival: All groups must contribute resources, but community bonds are strengthened (extra resilience points for all).
6. Natural Disaster: One randomly selected group loses half their resources.

Debrief:

After the game, discuss:
1. What strategies did groups use to meet their needs?
2. How did groups adapt to the various shocks introduced?
3. What kinds of collaboration emerged between different sectors?
4. How does this simulation reflect real economic challenges in Timor-Leste?
5. What lessons about building economic resilience can be drawn from the game?

This game simulates the interdependencies in a local economy and encourages players to think creatively about resource management, trade, and adapting to unexpected challenges. It provides a hands-on way to explore economic concepts and community resilience strategies relevant to Timor-Leste's context.
