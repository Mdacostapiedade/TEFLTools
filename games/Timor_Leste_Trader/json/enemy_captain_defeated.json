  "Arrr, blast ye to the depths, ye scurvy dog! Ye may have won this day, but mark me words - I'll be back to send ye and yer crew to Davy Jones' locker! Ye think ye've bested me? Ha! This be but a temporary setback for the likes o' me. Enjoy yer victory while ye can, ye bilge rat, for I swear on me own black heart that I'll have me revenge. Next time we cross swords, it'll be yer bones decoratin' the sea floor!"
