  "Arrr, blast ye to the depths, ye scurvy dog! Ye may have won this day, but mark me words - I'll be back to send ye and yer crew to Davy Jones' locker! Ye think ye've bested me? Ha! This be but a temporary setback for the likes o' me. Enjoy yer victory while ye can, ye bilge rat, for I swear on me own black heart that I'll have me revenge. Next time we cross swords, it'll be yer bones decoratin' the sea floor!",
  "Arrr, ye scurvy dog! Ye may have bested me this time, but mark me words - this ain't the last ye'll be seein' of ol' Tok Janggut! Ye've won the day, but the sea be a fickle mistress. Don't be gettin' too comfortable on yer high horse, ye bilge rat. I'll be back with a vengeance, and next time, I'll send ye and yer sorry crew to Davy Jones' locker! Curse yer black heart and may yer rum always be sour!",
  "Arrr, ye scurvy dog! Ye may have bested me this time, but mark me words - this ain't the last ye'll be seein' of me, ye bilge-sucking landlubber! May yer rum always be sour and yer gold turn to lead! I'll be back to send ye to Davy Jones' locker, mark my words! Ye've won the day, but the sea be a fickle mistress, and fortune may not smile on ye so kindly next time we cross swords. Enjoy yer victory while it lasts, ye mangy swab!"
