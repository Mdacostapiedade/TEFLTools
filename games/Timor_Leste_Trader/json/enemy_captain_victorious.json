  "Arrr, ye scurvy dog! Ye thought ye could best me on the high seas? Ha! Ye be nothin' but chum for the sharks now! I'll be takin' yer booty and yer pride, ye bilge rat. Next time, think twice 'fore ye cross swords with the likes o' me. Now, hand over yer valuables and maybe I'll let ye keep yer miserable hide. Victory be sweet as rum, and I'll be celebratin' with me crew tonight! Ye can join us in the brig, if ye fancy a dance with the devil. Yarr har har!",
  "Arr, ye scurvy dog! Ye thought ye could best me crew and me ship, did ye? Well, feast yer eyes on the tattered remains of yer pathetic fleet! We've sent yer sorry excuses for vessels to Davy Jones' locker, and now ye'll be swimmin' with the fishes!\n\nShiver me timbers, it brings a tear to me eye to see such a pitiful display of seamanship. Ye call yerself a captain? Bah! Ye couldn't captain a bathtub, let alone a proper ship!\n\nNow, ye bilge rat, ye've got two choices: surrender yer booty and join me crew, or take a long walk off a short plank. What'll it be? Either way, I'll be celebratin' this victory with a bottle o' rum and a hearty sea shanty! Yo ho ho, ye miserable landlubber!"
