    "name": "Pinnace",
    "description": "The smallest ship type, a trading vessel with a small crew and a few cannons. Hardly a danger, unless piloted by a captain looking for a quick boarding and relying on skillful fencing to win battles. Will not survive more than a few broadsides by an enemy ship.

    "name": "Sloop",
    "description": "A small combat vessel, relying on its keen maneuvering to confuse enemies while it pummels them with its small-but-potent cannon complement. Suitable for hunting down small or medium vessels, but will be in trouble if hit by a large broadside. Favored by different factions in the Timor Sea in different eras.",

    "name": "Barque",
    "description": "A mid-sized combat vessel with a good cargo hold. Usually encountered as a Portuguese trading ship in the Timor Sea, it is nimble enough to protect itself from most ship types, and can survive a broadside or two from an enemy ship without too much trouble.

    "name": "Cargo Fluyt",
    "description": "A mid-sized trader with poor maneuverability and speed for its size. While its cargo space is large, its cannon complement is lacking, and most Fluyts encountered in the Timor Sea are poorly crewed and equipped. This ship is largely unsuitable as a combat vessel, and is sailed only by Dutch traders in the later eras.",

    "description": "A powerful combat vessel comparable to the Frigate, its main strength is in dealing with other heavy ships, though slightly less efficient against small ships that are more likely to escape it. Develops a great speed running before the wind, which means it relies greatly on a good starting position during combat.

Incredibly difficult to control at most sailing angles, though it can run very quickly before the wind. When fully armed, a single broadside from a Galleon will sink or cripple most small or mid-sized ships, but it is still easy to outmaneuver the Galleon. Rarely, if ever, used by the Portuguese.",
