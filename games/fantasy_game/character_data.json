    "background_story": "In the mist-shrouded peaks of the northern mountains, you were born into a clan of serpent shamans who traced their lineage back to the great world serpent. Guided by the wisdom of your ancestors and the power of the wind, you learned to bridge the gap between the material and spiritual realms, offering prayers and sacrifices to the ancestral spirits in exchange for their blessings and guidance. As a mysterious illness began to spread through the villages, you embarked on a quest to find the sacred serpent staff, an ancient relic imbued with the power to heal and restore balance to the land."
