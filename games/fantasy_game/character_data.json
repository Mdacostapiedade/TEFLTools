    "background_story": "In the crystal-clear waters of the eastern lagoon, you were born into a pod of dolphin healers who had long ago formed a bond with the playful dolphin spirit. Guided by the joyful wisdom of the dolphin and the nurturing power of the earth, you learned to use the healing properties of the lagoon's sacred mud and plants, to communicate with the spirits of the land through the echoes of the underwater caves, and to use your empathetic nature to bring comfort and healing to those in need. When a strange blight began to spread through the lagoon, turning the water murky and the plants withered, you embarked on a quest to find the legendary pearl of the dolphin, an artifact said to hold the power to restore life and vitality to the earth."
