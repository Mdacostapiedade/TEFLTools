From a young age, Elgin was drawn to the water, finding solace in the rhythmic lapping of waves against the shore and the eerie calm of the misty swamps. His father, a respected guardian of the village, instilled in him a deep sense of duty and protection.\n\nAs Elgin grew, he began to notice strange occurrences in the marshes. Whispers carried on the wind, shadows moving against the current, and eerie lights flickering in the fog. The elders spoke of ancient water spirits and shapeshifting demons that resided in the depths, but most dismissed these as old wives' tales.\n\nOn his sixteenth birthday, Elgin's father gifted him an old battleaxe, a family heirloom said to be blessed by the water spirits.
