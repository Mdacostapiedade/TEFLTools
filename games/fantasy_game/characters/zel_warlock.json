    "background_story": "Zel's tale begins in the coastal village of Mirewatch, a small settlement perched on the edge of the Whispering Marshes. From a young age, Zel was fascinated by the eerie beauty of the swamplands and the secrets they held. His parents, both skilled fishers, warned him of the dangers that lurked beneath the murky waters, but their cautions only fueled his curiosity.\n\nAs a teenager, Zel's strength and dexterity made him an asset to the village, helping to haul in heavy nets and navigate treacherous waters. However, his true passion lay in unraveling the mysteries of the marsh.
