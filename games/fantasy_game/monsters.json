However, their true nature is revealed in their hunger for human flesh, particularly that of unborn fetuses. Aswangs use their shapeshifting ability to get close to pregnant women, then use their long, hollow tongues to pierce the womb and drain the fetus of its blood and organs. They are cunning, stealthy, and incredibly difficult to detect, making them one of the most feared monsters in Timorese folklore."

By day, it appears as a beautiful woman, but at night, it splits its body in half. The upper half grows large, bat-like wings and flies off into the night to hunt for prey, while the lower half remains rooted to the spot. The Manananggal preys primarily on pregnant women, using its long, hollow tongue to suck the hearts out of unborn fetuses. It is also known to drain the blood of sleeping victims. The Manananggal is vulnerable during the day when it must rejoin its two halves. If one half is destroyed, the creature dies."

Bound tightly from head to toe in white cloth, the Pocong moves by hopping, as it cannot walk with its legs bound together. Despite its awkward movement, the Pocong is surprisingly quick and agile. It attacks by biting with its exposed teeth, the only part of its body not covered by the shroud. The Pocong's bite is said to be venomous, causing the flesh around the wound to rot. Pocongs are often said to be the result of improper burial rites, or the corpses of those who died with unfinished business in the mortal world."
