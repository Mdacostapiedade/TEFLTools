Applying Myofascial Release:
1. Begin with gentle, broad contact over the area of restriction, using your hands or a tool.
2. Slowly sink into the tissue, applying sustained pressure in a specific direction.
3. Wait patiently for the tissue to soften, melt, or release under your touch.
4. Follow any subtle movements or sensations in the tissue, without forcing or pushing.
5. Maintain a state of presence, curiosity, and non-judgment throughout the process.

Facilitating Unwinding:
1. As the tissue releases, notice any spontaneous movements, tremors, or sensations in the client's body.
2. Allow these unwinding patterns to unfold naturally, without resistance or interference.
3. Support the client's body and provide gentle, reassuring touch as needed.
4. Encourage the client to breathe deeply and surrender to the unwinding process.
5. Maintain a safe, grounded space for the client to explore and express their experience.

Responding to Rebounding:
1. After a significant release or unwinding, the tissue may rebound or contract briefly.
2. Notice any changes in tissue texture, temperature, or sensitivity after the release.
3. Adapt your pressure and technique to meet the new state of the tissue.
4. Support the client in integrating and embodying the changes that have occurred.
5. Repeat the release process as needed, following the tissue's lead and the client's response.

Closing the Session:
1. When you sense the session is complete, slowly remove your hands from the client's body.
2. Allow the client to rest and integrate for a few moments before assisting them in sitting up.
3. Offer water and a grounded, present space for the client to reorient and debrief.
4. Discuss any notable sensations, emotions, or insights that arose during the session.
5. Provide any relevant self-care recommendations or exercises for the client to explore.

2. Take time to reflect on your own experience as a practitioner, noticing any challenges, learnings, or insights.
3. Engage in self-care practices to maintain your own physical, emotional, and energetic well-being.
4. Seek ongoing education, mentorship, and peer support to refine your MFR skills and knowledge.
