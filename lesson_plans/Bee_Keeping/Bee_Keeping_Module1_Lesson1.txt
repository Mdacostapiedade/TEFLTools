Module 1: Foundations of Natural Beekeeping

Lesson Objectives:
- Understand the history and philosophy behind natural beekeeping
- Explore connections between natural beekeeping and permaculture principles
- Increase vocabulary related to natural beekeeping concepts

Vocabulary Review (10 mins): 
Have students review the vocabulary words and definitions from Timor_Leste_Bee_Keeper_Story_Activity.txt in the Activities folder. Put students in pairs and have them quiz each other on the word meanings.

Reading & Comprehension (30 mins):
Have students read the passage in Timor_Leste_Bee_Keeper_Story.txt, in the Readings folder, about José the Timorese natural beekeeper. As they read, they should underline any words/phrases related to beekeeping history, philosophy or practices.

After reading, put students in small groups to discuss and answer the comprehension questions together. Allow each group to share 1-2 answers with the class.

Natural Beekeeping Principles (20 mins):
Explain that José's practices reflect the core philosophy and ethics of the natural beekeeping movement. Using the board, co-create a list of the key principles exemplified in the story, such as:
- Non-interference/Minimal disturbance
- Bee-centric hive designs 
- No chemicals/treatments
- Facilitating rather than controlling
- Sacred relationship with bees
- Integration with environment

Then have students write 1-2 examples from the story that illustrate each principle.

Permaculture Connections (15 mins):
Discuss how natural beekeeping aligns with core permaculture ethics like Earth Care, People Care, and Fair Shares. Students should be able to identify story elements that relate to each ethic.

Review principles like "Observe & Interact" and "Use & Value Renewable Resources" and have students explain the connection to José's practices.

Assign reading on the foundations/history of the natural beekeeping movement for next class. (see History_and_Philosophy_of-Natural_Beekeeping.txt in the Readings folder
