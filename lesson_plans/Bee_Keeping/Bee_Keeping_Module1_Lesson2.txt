Permaculture Ethics (10 mins):
Introduce the three core ethical principles of permaculture:
1. Earth Care - Provisions for all life systems to remain viable
2. People Care - Allowing people to access resources for their needs
3. Fair Shares - Ensuring resources are utilized sustainably and shared equitably

At the heart of natural beekeeping is prioritizing the intuitive needs and natural processes of the honeybee colony over human desires for management and production. Conventional beekeeping often views the hive as a honeycomb factory to be optimized and controlled. Natural approaches instead aim to provide accommodations that work in harmony with the bees' ingrained tendencies and nest structure preferences shaped over millions of years.
Hive Designs
Two key hive styles embodying bee-centric design are top-bar hives and horizontal lay hives. Rather than the stacked, vertically-organized boxes of Langstroth hives, these models arrange the colony's living space horizontally in a single unified cavity.
Top-Bar Hives feature angled roofs and side walls containing only a series of top bars where bees attach their naturally-built combs. The open architecture and lack of frames/foundation allows the colony complete freedom to construct their home according to ancient blueprints. Top-bar hives also make harvesting easier as combs can simply be removed from the end without disturbing those with brood.
Horizontal Lay Hives contain long, deep frames, up to 24" in depth, more closely replicating the expansive dimensions of a hollow tree trunk. The bees are unencumbered by the narrow spacing and small volumes that can constrain normal colony development. Top bars are arranged in a single level plane, avoiding the need for laborious heavy lifting of stacked boxes.
Both designs enable the colony to establish the ideal brood nest geometry and properly stratify their food reserves, pollen stores and population demographics in balanced concordance with seasonal, environmental and metabolic conditions. Their modularity also supports natural processes like swarming for colony reproduction.
Facilitative Hive Management
Natural beekeepers adopting these hive styles gravitate towards facilitative, bee-centric practices over the intense interventions that characterize conventional approaches. Some key aspects include:
Mimimal Disturbance - Hives are opened for inspection as infrequently as possible, often only once or twice a year at most. This limits stress on the colony and random termination of regionally-adapted genetics through swarm prevention.
Embracing Natural Reproduction - Rather than aggressive swarm deterrence methods or artificial propagation, natural beekeepers make accommodations for functional swarming and natural reproductive cycles. Swarm capture and colony multiplication occurs in alignment with ancient processes.
Chemical-Free Living - No synthetic miticides, fumigants, antibiotics or other chemical treatments are introduced to the hives. The bees' immune systems and life-force energy remains unadulterated.
Balanced Harvesting - Rather than unsustainably extracting maximum yields, hive products like honey and wax are harvested judiciously, always leaving ample reserves to nurture colony resiliency and overwintering capacity.
Locally-Adapted Stock - Great care is taken to cultivate regionally adapted, therapy-free strains optimized for local climate and flora conditions through natural selection and increase.
Holistic Habitat Management - The broader landscape is developed to provide year-round, biodiverse forage and habitat that nurtures wellness, genetic diversity and vitality for all pollinator inhabitants.
Through these facilitative, bee-first practices, natural beekeepers aim to cooperatively steward and learn from the inexhaustible genius found within these resilient superorganisms. When the bees' inbuilt strengths and cohesive interdependence with their environment is honored, they can thrive as they have for millennia before our management interventions.
