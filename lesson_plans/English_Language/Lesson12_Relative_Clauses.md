# Lesson Plan: Relative Clauses (Defining and Non-defining)

## Resources:
- Textbook: English Grammar Guide
- Handouts with example sentences and exercises
- Pictures of famous people or places to practice describing with relative clauses
- Quotes:
    "The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot read." - Mark Twain (example of defining relative clause)
    "My brother, who lives in New York, is visiting next week." (example of non-defining relative clause)

## Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn the difference between defining and non-defining relative clauses
- Students will practice forming and using both types of relative clauses
- Students will analyze when to use different relative pronouns (who, which, that, whose, whom)

## Warm-up (10 mins):
- Show pictures of famous people and elicit descriptions, guiding students to use relative clauses
- Discuss the difference between essential and additional information in these descriptions

## Pre-Teaching (10 mins):
- Introduce key vocabulary: clause, antecedent, relative pronoun, comma
- Review basic sentence structure

## Presentation (20 mins):
- Explain defining relative clauses:
  * Provide essential information
  * No commas
  * Can use that, which, who, whose, whom
- Explain non-defining relative clauses:
  * Provide additional, non-essential information
  * Use commas
  * Cannot use that
- Demonstrate the use of different relative pronouns

## Practice Activities (30 mins):
1. Sentence combination: Students combine pairs of sentences using relative clauses
2. Punctuation exercise: Students add or remove commas in sentences with relative clauses
3. Relative pronoun selection: Students choose the correct relative pronoun for given sentences

## Production (20 mins):
- Group work: Students create a quiz show with questions containing relative clauses
- Role-play: Groups take turns hosting and participating in their quiz shows

## Wrap-up (10 mins):
- Review key points and address any remaining questions
- Quick quiz: Students identify whether given relative clauses are defining or non-defining

## Homework:
- Write a short biography of a famous person, using both defining and non-defining relative clauses
