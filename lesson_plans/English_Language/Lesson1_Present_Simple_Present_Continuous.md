# Lesson Plan: Present Simple and Present Continuous

## Resources:
- Textbook: English Grammar Guide
- Handouts with example sentences and exercises
- Video clips showing daily routines and ongoing actions
- Quotes:
    "I think, therefore I am." - Ren√© Descartes (example of present simple for states)
    "I'm loving it." - McDonald's slogan (example of stative verb used in continuous form for emphasis)
    "The Earth revolves around the Sun." (example of present simple for general truths)
    "Look! It's raining outside." (example of present continuous for current situations)

## Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn to distinguish between uses of the present simple and present continuous
- Students will practice forming affirmative, negative, and question forms in both tenses
- Students will analyze the appropriate contexts for using each tense

## Warm-up (10 mins):
- Show pictures of people doing various activities and ask students to describe what they see
- Elicit responses in both present simple (e.g., "He works in an office") and present continuous (e.g., "She is reading a book")
- Discuss the difference in meaning between the two forms used

## Pre-Teaching (10 mins):
- Introduce key vocabulary: habit, routine, temporary, permanent, state verb, action verb
- Have students categorize common verbs into "state" and "action" groups

## Presentation (20 mins):
- Explain the form and use of present simple:
  * Form: subject + base verb (+ s/es for third person singular)
  * Uses: habits, routines, general truths, states
- Explain the form and use of present continuous:
  * Form: subject + be (am/is/are) + verb-ing
  * Uses: actions happening now, temporary situations, future arrangements
- Provide examples for each use and elicit more from students

## Practice Activities (30 mins):
1. Gap-fill exercise: Students complete sentences with the correct form of verbs in brackets
2. Error correction: Students identify and correct mistakes in present tense usage
3. Sentence transformation: Change present simple sentences to present continuous and vice versa, discussing the change in meaning

## Production (20 mins):
- Pair work: Students interview each other about their daily routines (present simple) and what they're doing this week (present continuous)
- Report back: Students tell the class about their partner using both tenses

## Wrap-up (10 mins):
- Review key points and address any remaining questions
- Quick quiz: Students identify whether given sentences should use present simple or present continuous

## Homework:
- Write a paragraph describing your typical day (present simple) and what you're doing differently this week (present continuous)
- Complete exercises from the textbook on present simple and present continuous

## Vocabulary:
- Habit (noun) - A settled or regular tendency or practice, especially one that is hard to give up
- Routine (noun) - A sequence of actions regularly followed
- Temporary (adj) - Lasting for only a limited period of time; not permanent
- Permanent (adj) - Lasting or intended to last or remain unchanged indefinitely

- Action verb (noun) - A verb that expresses physical or mental action

This lesson plan introduces students to the fundamental differences between the present simple and present continuous tenses. Through a mix of explicit instruction, guided practice, and communicative activities, students will develop their understanding of when and how to use each tense appropriately. The homework assignment encourages students to apply their learning in a personal context.
