# Lesson Plan: Present Perfect Simple and Continuous

## Resources:
- Textbook: English Grammar Guide
- Handouts with example sentences and exercises
- Audio recordings of conversations using present perfect tenses
- Quotes:
    "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe." - Roy Batty, Blade Runner (example of present perfect simple)
    "I've been waiting for you all day!" (example of present perfect continuous)

## Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn to distinguish between uses of the present perfect simple and present perfect continuous
- Students will practice forming affirmative, negative, and question forms in both tenses
- Students will analyze the appropriate contexts for using each tense

## Warm-up (10 mins):
- Ask students about their life experiences (e.g., "Have you ever traveled abroad?")
- Discuss current situations that started in the past (e.g., "How long have you been studying English?")

## Pre-Teaching (10 mins):
- Introduce key vocabulary: experience, achievement, result, duration, recent past
- Review past participle forms of common irregular verbs

## Presentation (20 mins):
- Explain the form and use of present perfect simple:
  * Form: subject + have/has + past participle
  * Uses: past experiences with present relevance, completed actions with present results
- Explain the form and use of present perfect continuous:
  * Form: subject + have/has been + verb-ing
  * Uses: ongoing actions that started in the past and continue to the present, emphasis on duration

## Practice Activities (30 mins):
1. Gap-fill exercise: Students complete sentences with the correct present perfect form
2. Sentence transformation: Change present perfect simple to continuous and vice versa, discussing the change in meaning
3. Role-play: Students interview each other about life experiences and current activities

## Production (20 mins):
