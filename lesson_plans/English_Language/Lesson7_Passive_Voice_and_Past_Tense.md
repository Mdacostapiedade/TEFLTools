# Lesson Plan: Passive Voice in Present and Past Tenses

## Resources:
- Textbook: English Grammar Guide
- Handouts with example sentences and exercises
- News articles or scientific texts with passive voice examples
- Quotes:
    "Rome wasn't built in a day." (example of passive in past simple)
    "Mistakes were made." (common use of passive to avoid responsibility)

## Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn the structure and use of passive voice in present and past tenses
- Students will practice transforming active sentences to passive and vice versa
- Students will analyze contexts where passive voice is preferable or necessary

## Warm-up (10 mins):
- Show sentences describing processes (e.g., "Coffee beans are harvested by hand")
- Ask students to identify who or what is performing the action, introducing the concept of focus in passive voice

## Pre-Teaching (10 mins):
- Introduce key vocabulary: agent, recipient of action, past participle, by-phrase
- Review past participle forms of common irregular verbs

## Presentation (20 mins):
- Explain the structure of passive voice:
  * Be + past participle
- Demonstrate formation in present simple and past simple:
  * Present: am/is/are + past participle
  * Past: was/were + past participle
- Explain uses of passive voice:
  * When the doer of the action is unknown, unimportant, or obvious
  * To focus on the action or recipient rather than the agent
  * In formal or scientific writing

## Practice Activities (30 mins):
1. Sentence transformation: Students change active sentences to passive and vice versa
2. Gap-fill exercise: Students complete passive sentences with correct form of 'be' and past participles
3. Information gap: Students exchange information about processes using passive voice

## Production (20 mins):
- Group work: Students create a poster describing how a product is made, using passive voice
- Presentations: Groups present their posters to the class

## Wrap-up (10 mins):
- Review key points and address any remaining questions
- Quick quiz: Students identify whether given sentences are active or passive and transform them

## Homework:
- Write a short report on how something is done (e.g., how a car is manufactured) using passive voice
- Complete exercises from the textbook on passive voice in present and past tenses

## Vocabulary:
- Agent (noun) - The person or thing that performs an action
- Recipient of action (noun phrase) - The person or thing that is affected by the action
- Past participle (noun) - The form of a verb, typically ending in -ed, -en, or -t, used in forming perfect and passive tenses
- By-phrase (noun) - The part of a passive sentence that indicates who or what performs the action
