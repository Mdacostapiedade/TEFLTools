## Resources:
- Textbook: English Grammar Guide
- Handouts with example sentences and exercises
- Visual aids showing count and noncount nouns
- Quotes:
    "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?" (example using both count and noncount nouns)
    "Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy ice cream, which is kind of the same thing." (example of noncount and count nouns)

## Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn to distinguish between count and noncount nouns
- Students will practice using appropriate quantifiers with count and noncount nouns
- Students will analyze how some nouns can be both count and noncount with different meanings

## Warm-up (10 mins):
- Show a variety of objects and substances, asking students to categorize them as things they can count or things they can't count
- Introduce the terms "count" and "noncount" nouns

## Pre-Teaching (10 mins):
- Introduce key vocabulary: quantifier, partitive, container, unit of measurement
- Review plural forms of count nouns

## Presentation (20 mins):
- Explain characteristics of count nouns:
  * Can be pluralized
  * Used with a/an in singular form
  * Used with number quantifiers (e.g., many, few, several)
- Explain characteristics of noncount nouns:
  * Cannot be pluralized
  * Not used with a/an
  * Used with non-number quantifiers (e.g., much, little, some)
- Demonstrate nouns that can be both count and noncount:
  * e.g., "chicken" (animal vs. meat), "paper" (sheet vs. material)

## Practice Activities (30 mins):
1. Classification exercise: Students sort a list of nouns into count and noncount categories
2. Gap-fill exercise: Students complete sentences with appropriate quantifiers
3. Sentence creation: Students write sentences using given nouns as both count and noncount

## Production (20 mins):
- Pair work: Students create a menu for a restaurant, using a mix of count and noncount nouns
- Presentations: Pairs present their menus, explaining their choices of nouns and quantifiers

## Wrap-up (10 mins):
- Review key points and address any remaining questions
- Quick quiz: Students identify whether given nouns are count, noncount, or can be both

## Homework:
- Write a short descriptive paragraph about a room in your house, using a variety of count and noncount nouns with appropriate quantifiers
