Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

I am a story teller and I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call the danger of the single story I grew up in the University campus in eastern Nigeria my mother says that I started reading at the age of two although I think four is probably close to the truth so I was an early reader British and American children's books I was also an early writer the age of seven stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading all my characters were white and blue white they played in the snow the 8 Appleseed and they talked a lot about the weather how lovely it was that the sun had come out  now this despite the fact that I live play Nigeria I've never been outside Nigeria we didn't have snow we ate mango and we never talked about the weather because there was no need to my character is also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the British books I read drunk ginger beer never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was and for many years afterwards I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer but that is another story what does demonstrates I think is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story particularly as children because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign I have become convinced that books by the very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify nothing's changed when I discovered African books there weren't many of them available and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books but because of writers like to know what should be on camera live I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature I realize that people like me girls with skin the color of chocolate kinky hair could not form ponytails could also exist in literature I started to write about things I recognized no I loved those American and British books I read they said my imagination opened up new walls for me but the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature so what the discovery of African writers did for me was this it saved me from having a single story of what books are I come from a conventional middle class Nigerian family my father was a professor my mother was an administrator  live in domestic help who would often come from nearby rural villages so the year I turned eight we got a new house boy his name was fetty the only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor my mother sent yams and rice and are old Clues to his family and when I didn't finish my dinner my mother would say finish your food don't you know people like fiddies family have nothing so I felt enormous pity 40 days family then on Saturday we went to his village to visit and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of diet Raffia that his brother had made I was startled to me that anybody in his family could actually make all I had heard about them was how poor they were so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor the poverty was my single story of them yes later I thought about this when I left Nigeria to go to university in the United States  my American roommate was play she asked where I had learned to speak English so well and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language she asked if she could listen to what she called my tribal music I was consequently very disappointed when I produced my tape of Mariah car she assumed that I did not know how to use a stove what struck me was this she had felt sorry for me even before she saw me had default position toward me as an African was a kind of patronizing well meaning pixie my roommate had a single story of Africa single story of catastrophe in this single story there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way no possibility of feelings more complex than pity no possibility of a connection as human equals I must say that before I went to the US I didn't consciously identify as African but in the US whenever Africa came out people turn to me never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia but I did come to embrace this new identity and in many ways I think of myself now as African although I still get quite irritable when Africa is referred to as a country the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from Lagos 2 days ago in which there was an announcement on the Virgin Flight about the Charity Walk in India Africa and other countries so after I had spent some years in the US as an African I began to understand my roommates response to me if I had not grown up in Nigeria and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images I too would think the Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes beautiful animals and incomprehensible people fighting senseless Wars dying of poverty and AIDS unable to speak for themselves I'm waiting to be saved play a  I would see Africans in the same way that I as a child Hudson fee days family this single story of Africa ultimately comes I think from Western literature I hear some quotes from the rising of a London Merchant call John Locke who sailed to West Africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage after referring to the black Africans as beasts who have no houses he writes they are also people without heads having their mouths and eyes in their breasts now I've left every time I've read this and one must admire the imagination of John Locke but what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling African stories in the West a tradition of sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives of difference of Darkness of people who in the words of the wonderful poets Richard Kipling a half devil half child  I began to realize that my American must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of the single story ask how to Professor who once told me that my novel was not authentically African no I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel 35 field in the number of places but I had no price imagine that it had failed at achieving something called African authenticity in fact I did not know what African authenticity was the professor told me that my character what's too much like him an educated on middle class my characters drove they were not starving therefore they were not authentically African but I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty and the question of the single story I visited Mexico from the US the political climate in the US of the time was tense and there were debates going on about immigration and as often happens in America immigration became synonymous with Mexicans they were endless stories of Mexicans as people who were please sing the Healthcare System sneaking across the border being arrested at the border that sort of thing I remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara watching the people going to work rolling up to Tia's in the marketplace smoking laughing I remember first feeling slight surprise and then I was overwhelmed with shame I realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind the abject immigrant I had bought into the single story of Mexicans and I could not have been more ashamed of myself so that is how to create a single story show a people as one thing as only one thing over and over again and that is what they become it is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power there's a word an evil word that I think about whenever I think about the past structures of the world and it is in Cali it's a noun that Loosely translates to to be greater than another like economic and political walls Stories 2 are defined by the principal of alkyl how they are who tells them when they are told how many stories are told I really dependent on power how is the ability not just to tell the story of another person but to make it the definitive story of that person the Palestinian poet movie rights that if you want to dispossess a people the simplest way to do it is to tell the story and to start with secondly start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans and not with the arrival of the British and you have an entirely different story start the story with the failure of the African I'm not with the colonial creation of the African and you have an entirely different story I recently spoke at the University where a student told me that it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abuses like the father character in my novel I told him that I had just read a novel called American Psycho and that it was such a shame that Young Americans with serial murderers it was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all  I know this is not because I'm a better person than that student but because of America's cultural and economic power I had many stories of America I had read Thailand Updike and Steinberg and gateskill I did not have a single story of America when I learned some years ago that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful I began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me  but the truth is that I had a very happy childhood full of laughter and love in a very close-knit family but I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps my cousin Polly died because he could not get adequate Health Care one of my closest friends to Coloma died in a plane crash because of fire trucks did not have water I grew up on the repressive military government that devalued education so that sometimes my parents will not pay their salaries and so was a child I saw Jam disappear from The Breakfast Table then margarine disappeared then bread became too expensive then became Russian a list of all a kind of normalized political fear invaded Our Lives all of these stories make me who I am what's the insistent only these negative stories is the flat in my experience answer Overlook the many other stories that formed me the single story creates stereotypes and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue but that they are incomplete they make one story become the only story of course Africa is a continent full of catastrophes immense one such as the horrific ribs in Congo and depressing one such as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in Nigeria but the other stories  and it's very important it is just as important to talk about them I've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person the consequence of the single story is this it robs people of dignity it makes our recognition of equal Humanity difficult it emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar so what is before my Mexican trip I had followed the immigration debate from both the US and the Mexican what if my mother had told us that fiddies family was poor and had walking what if we had an African television network that broadcast diverse African stories all over the world what the Nigerian rights are chinua Achebe calls a balance of stories what is my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher mukhtar Bakery a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a Publishing House the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature he disagreed he felt that people who could read would read if you made literature affordable and available to them shortly after he published my first novel I went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview on a woman who walks there as a messenger came up to me and said I really like your novel I didn't like the ending now you must try to Sequel and this is what will happen she went on to tell me what to write in this people that was very moved here was a woman part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians who are not supposed to be readers  justified in telling me what to write in the sequ what is my roommate knew about my friend for me yond a Fearless woman who hosts the TV show in Lagos and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget what if my roommate new about the hot procedure that was performed in the Legos hospital last week what is my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music talented people singing in English and pigeon and Igbo and Yoruba and it mixing influences from Jay Z to Fela to Bob Marley to their grandfathers what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports what is my roommate knew about Nollywood full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds films so popular that they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they produce what is my roommate near about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider who was just started her own business selling hair extensions all about the millions of other Nigerians Who start businesses and sometimes fail but continue to nurse ambition every time I am home I'm confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerian a field infrastructure a field government but also by the incredible resilience of people who Thrive despite the government rather than because of it I teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer and it is amazing to me how many people apply how many people are eager to to tell stories my Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit it's called for a financial stand we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that are already exists and providing books for State schools that don't have anything in the libraries and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops and reading and writing for all the people who are eager to tell our ministers stories matter many stories matter stories have been used to dispossess and to my line what stories can also be used to empower add to humanize stories can break the Dignity of the people but stories can also repair  the American right to Alice Walker wrote this about the southern relatives who had moved to the north and she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind they sat around reading the book themselves listening to me read the book and the kind of paradise what's regained I would like to end with this thought that when we reject the single story when we realize that there is never a single story about any place we regain a kind of paradise thank you
