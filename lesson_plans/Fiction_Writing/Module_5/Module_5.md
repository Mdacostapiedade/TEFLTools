# ### Module 5
Why do I write? To investigate the mystery of existence. To tolerate myself. To get closer to everything that is outside of me.

If I want to understand what moves me, what confuses me, what pains me—everything that makes me react, in short—I have to put it into words. Writing is my only way of absorbing and organizing life. Otherwise it would terrify me, it would upset me too much.

What passes without being put into words, without being transformed and, in a certain sense, purified by the crucible of writing, has no meaning for me. Only words that endure seem real. They have a power, a value superior to us.

Given that I try to decipher everything through writing, maybe writing in Italian is simply my way of learning the language in a more profound, more stimulating way.

Ever since I was a child, I’ve belonged only to my words. I don’t have a country, a specific culture. If I didn’t write, if I didn’t work with words, I wouldn’t feel that I’m present on the earth.

What does a word mean? And a life? In the end, it seems to me, the same thing. Just as a word can have many dimensions, many nuances, great complexity, so, too, can a person, a life. Language is the mirror, the principal metaphor. Because ultimately the meaning of a word, like that of a person, is boundless, ineffable.

### Dialogue-Only Scene featuring Characters from Different Cultural Backgrounds

1. Choose two characters from distinctly different cultural backgrounds.
2. Write a scene of 500-750 words using only dialogue (no narrative or action beats).
3. The scene should reveal:

   - A conflict or misunderstanding arising from their cultural differences
   - An attempt to resolve or understand the conflict
4. Use techniques discussed in class to give each character a unique voice.

## 5. Assignment Details

### Multicultural Dialogue Analysis and Creation

1. Select a piece of dialogue (200-300 words) from a work of multicultural literature not discussed in class.
2. Analyze the dialogue, addressing:
   - How the author creates unique voices for the characters
   - Ways in which cultural background is revealed through dialogue
   - Techniques used to make the dialogue feel authentic
3. Rewrite the dialogue, changing the cultural backgrounds of the characters. Maintain the same basic content and conflict, but alter the voices and cultural references to fit the new backgrounds.
4. Write a reflection (500 words) on the challenges you faced in rewriting the dialogue and what you learned about crafting culturally diverse voices.
