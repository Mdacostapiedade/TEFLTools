For a fiction writing course covering "The Art of Dialogue" from John Gardner's "The Art of Fiction," I can provide a general overview of key concepts related to writing effective dialogue in fiction, without reproducing copyrighted material:

1. Purpose of dialogue:
- Reveal character
- Advance the plot

2. Characteristics of good dialogue:

- Uses subtext effectively

3. Techniques for writing dialogue:

- Show interruptions and pauses

4. Common dialogue mistakes to avoid:

- All characters sounding the same

5. Exercises to improve dialogue writing:
