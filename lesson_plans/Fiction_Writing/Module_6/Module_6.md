# Week 11-12 Resources: Theme, Subtext, and the Impact of Science and Technology

## Lecture Notes

### Incorporating themes and symbolism in fiction
- Definition of theme: The central idea or underlying meaning of a literary work
- How to develop themes:
  - Through character development and growth
  - Plot events and conflicts
  - Dialogue and character interactions
  - Setting and atmosphere
- Symbolism: Using objects, characters, or events to represent abstract ideas
- Examples of common symbols and their potential meanings
- Techniques for subtly incorporating themes without being heavy-handed

### Exploring works that push the boundaries of reality
- Overview of speculative fiction genres: science fiction, fantasy, magical realism
- Key authors and works that blend reality and imagination
- Techniques for world-building and establishing alternate realities
- Balancing familiar elements with the fantastical

### The role of imagination and speculation in literature
- How authors use "what if" scenarios to explore human nature and society
- The power of metaphor in addressing complex real-world issues
- Extrapolating current trends and technologies into potential futures
- Using imaginative elements to provide fresh perspectives on familiar themes

## Discussion Questions

1. How can authors effectively incorporate themes without making their work feel didactic or preachy?
2. What are some examples of symbols you've encountered in your reading, and how did they enhance the story's themes?
3. How do works of speculative fiction allow us to examine real-world issues from new angles?
4. What responsibilities, if any, do authors have when imagining potential futures or alternate realities?
5. How can technological elements in fiction serve as more than just plot devices?
6. What makes some theme-heavy works feel timeless, while others become dated?

## Writing Exercise Instructions

2. Select a scientific concept or technological innovation as a central element
3. Write a flash fiction piece (500 words max) that incorporates both the theme and the scientific/technological element
4. Focus on using symbolism and subtext to convey your theme, rather than stating it explicitly
5. Consider how the scientific/technological element interacts with or illuminates your chosen theme
