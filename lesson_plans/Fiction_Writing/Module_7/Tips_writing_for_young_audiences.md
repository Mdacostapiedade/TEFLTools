Writing Tip Sheet: 5 Ways to Avoid Clichés in Coming-of-Age Stories

Coming-of-age stories are a beloved genre in literature, but they can easily fall into predictable patterns. Here are five ways to keep your coming-of-age story fresh and engaging:

1. Subvert Traditional Milestones

Cliché: First kiss, prom night, graduation
How to avoid:
- Focus on unconventional rites of passage
- Explore cultural or personal milestones specific to your character
- Show growth through unexpected experiences

Example: Instead of centering on prom night, have your character experience a transformative moment during a part-time job or while caring for a sick relative.

Exercise: List three unique milestones that could be significant for your protagonist, considering their background, interests, and circumstances.

2. Develop Complex Mentor Relationships

Cliché: Wise, all-knowing adult guide
How to avoid:
- Create flawed mentors with their own struggles
- Show mentors learning from the protagonist
- Explore non-traditional mentor figures (e.g., younger siblings, rivals)

Example: Depict a mentor figure who is dealing with their own coming-of-age challenges, creating a parallel journey with the protagonist.

Exercise: Write a scene where your protagonist teaches their mentor something important, reversing the typical dynamic.

3. Reimagine Family Dynamics

Cliché: Rebellious teen vs. strict parents
How to avoid:
- Explore nuanced family relationships
- Show evolving dynamics as the protagonist matures
- Include non-traditional family structures

Example: Portray a protagonist who has a close relationship with their parents but struggles with living up to their own expectations rather than rebelling against authority.

Exercise: Create a family tree for your protagonist, including at least one unconventional relationship or family structure.

4. Avoid Stereotypical Friend Groups

Cliché: The popular crowd, the outcasts, the jocks
How to avoid:
- Develop unique, multifaceted characters
- Show friendships that cross social boundaries
- Explore the complexity of teen social dynamics

Example: Depict a friendship between a star athlete and a passionate artist, focusing on their shared interests and mutual growth.

Exercise: Write character profiles for three of your protagonist's friends, ensuring each has a distinct personality, background, and role in the story.

5. Challenge Gender and Sexuality Norms

Cliché: Heteronormative romance plots
How to avoid:
- Include diverse LGBTQ+ characters and experiences
- Explore gender identity and expression
- Focus on self-discovery beyond romantic relationships

Example: Write a coming-of-age story where the protagonist's journey centers on understanding and embracing their non-binary identity.

Exercise: Rewrite a classic coming-of-age scene (e.g., first crush, school dance) from the perspective of an LGBTQ+ character.

Additional Tips:

1. Research contemporary teen experiences to ensure authenticity.
2. Read diverse, modern coming-of-age stories for inspiration.
3. Seek feedback from beta readers in the target age group.
4. Focus on internal growth as much as external events.
5. Incorporate technology and social media realistically.

Remember: The key to avoiding clichés is to focus on your character's unique journey. What makes their coming-of-age story different from others? How can you tell it in a way that feels fresh and authentic?

Final Exercise:
Outline a coming-of-age story that incorporates at least three of the techniques discussed above. Include a brief character description, the central conflict, and key moments in the protagonist's journey.

By following these guidelines and exercises, you'll be well-equipped to write a coming-of-age story that avoids common clichés and resonates with contemporary readers.
