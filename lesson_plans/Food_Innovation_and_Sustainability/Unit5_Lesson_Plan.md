Here's a detailed lesson plan for the unit "Sustainable Food Systems" formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Sustainable Food Systems in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with local food system diagrams
- Photos or videos of local farming practices
- Guest speaker (local farmer or agricultural expert) if possible

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define sustainability in the context of food systems
- Identify key challenges and opportunities in Timor-Leste's food production
- Analyze and discuss case studies of sustainable food initiatives in Timor-Leste
- Propose ideas for improving local food sustainability

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show images of various food items common in Timor-Leste
- Ask students to brainstorm where these foods come from and how they are produced
- Discuss the concept of a "food system" and what it might include

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Sustainability
- Food system
- Agroecology
- Food security
- Biodiversity
- Climate resilience

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Principles of sustainability in food production
   - Define sustainable agriculture
   - Explain the three pillars: environmental, economic, and social sustainability
   - Discuss the importance of biodiversity and ecosystem services

2. Local challenges and opportunities in Timor-Leste
   - Climate change impacts on agriculture
   - Soil degradation and erosion
   - Water scarcity
   - Market access for small-scale farmers
   - Opportunities for organic farming and agroforestry

3. Case studies of sustainable food initiatives in Timor-Leste
   - Present 2-3 local case studies (e.g., community gardens, agroforestry projects, organic coffee production)
   - Analyze the benefits and challenges of each initiative

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

1. Group discussion: Divide students into small groups and assign each group a local food item. Ask them to map out its current production system and identify areas for improving sustainability.

2. Role-play: Students take on roles of different stakeholders in the food system (farmers, consumers, policymakers) and discuss potential solutions to local food sustainability challenges.

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Design a sustainable farm: Students work in pairs to sketch and describe a small-scale sustainable farm suitable for Timor-Leste, incorporating principles learned in the lesson.

2. Presentation: Each pair presents their farm design to the class, explaining their sustainability features.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Conduct a quick quiz on main concepts
- Encourage students to share one new thing they learned and one question they still have

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will:
1. Research and write a one-page report on a traditional Timorese farming practice that promotes sustainability
2. Interview an elder in their community about how local food production has changed over time and summarize the findings

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Sustainability: Meeting present needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs
- Food system: The interconnected activities involved in producing, processing, distributing, and consuming food
- Agroecology: An ecological approach to agriculture that promotes sustainable farming practices
- Food security: The state of having reliable access to sufficient, affordable, nutritious food
