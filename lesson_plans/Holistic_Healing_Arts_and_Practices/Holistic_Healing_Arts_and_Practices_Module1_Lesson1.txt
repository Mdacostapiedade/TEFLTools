Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn vocabulary related to holistic healing and the mind-body-spirit connection
- Students will practice reading comprehension and discussion skills
- Students will analyze the benefits and limitations of a holistic approach to health

Warm-up (10 mins):
- Write "holistic", "mind-body-spirit" on one side of the board and "functional" and "Western medicine" on the other and have students brainstorm related words or concepts
- Discuss the idea that functional medicine centers on establishing the root cause of symptoms and developing a plan to eliminate them vs. holistic medicine which looks at the body, diet, exercise, family, emotional and spiritual health all as one.
- Ask students which type they would prefer to rely on and what kind of treatment/help they might expect if they had a problem like if they had a broken arm, a death in the family, were overweight, had PTSD or cancer, etc.
  Studies show that people who actively take charge of their healing and use all the resources they have available to them have the best chances of healing.
Pre-Reading (10 mins):
- Introduce key vocabulary: holistic, emotional wellness, multifaceted, embodiment, mindfulness
- Have students share their experiences with the impact of mental or emotional states on physical health

Reading Activity (15 mins):
- Provide excerpts from the quotes or your own transcript related to holistic medicine
- As they read, students identify the main principles and supporting examples

Post-Reading (20 mins):
- Comprehension questions to check understanding (e.g., What are the key principles of holistic medicine? How do thoughts, emotions, diet and environment impact physical health?)
- Ask students to share any holistic or natural healing practices from their country, family or things they do personally for themselves like prayer, meditation, making herbal medicine, etc.
- Have students analyze case studies or personal experiences demonstrating the mind-body-heart connection

Wrap-up (10 mins):
- Review key vocabulary and concepts from the lesson
- Assign homework: Research a specific holistic therapy (e.g., meditation, prayer, martial arts, herbalism, shamanism, Chinese traditional medicine, ayurveda, massage, etc.) and its reported benefits for physical and mental health

Vocabulary:
- Holistic (adj) - Characterized by the belief that the parts of something are intimately interconnected and explicable only by reference to the whole
- Interrelated (noun) - The state of being connected with each other

This lesson plan introduces students to the fundamental concepts of holistic medicine, encouraging them to explore the interconnectedness of mental, physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. The reading activity, discussion questions, and homework assignment are designed to foster critical thinking about the potential benefits and limitations of holistic healing approaches.

## Grammar Points:

- Articles with abstract nouns: Discuss the use of articles (a, an, the) with abstract nouns related to holistic healing (e.g., "the mind," "a balance," "harmony"). Explain when to use or omit articles with these concepts.

- Noun phrases: Practice forming and using complex noun phrases to describe holistic concepts (e.g., "mind-body connection," "emotional well-being," "spiritual healing practices").
