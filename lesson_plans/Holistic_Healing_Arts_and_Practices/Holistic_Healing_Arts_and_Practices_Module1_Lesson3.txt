Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn vocabulary related to trauma, polyvagal theory, and nervous system regulation
- Students will practice reading comprehension and discussion skills
- Students will understand the basic concepts of how trauma affects the nervous system and the role of polyvagal theory in understanding this process

Warm-up (10 mins):
- Write the words "trauma," "nervous system," and "polyvagal theory" on the board and ask students to share what they know or have heard about these terms
- Briefly discuss how traumatic experiences can have lasting effects on an individual's physical and mental well-being

Pre-Reading (10 mins):
- Introduce key vocabulary: trauma, autonomic nervous system, sympathetic nervous system, parasympathetic nervous system, vagus nerve, polyvagal theory
- Have students discuss how they think the nervous system might respond to a threatening or traumatic situation

Reading Activity (20 mins):
- Provide a simplified text explaining the basics of polyvagal theory and how it relates to trauma and nervous system regulation
- As they read, students should identify the main ideas and supporting details
- Text: "Polyvagal theory, developed by Dr. Stephen Porges, helps explain how our autonomic nervous system responds to stress and trauma. The theory proposes that the vagus nerve, a key component of the parasympathetic nervous system, has two branches: the ventral vagal and the dorsal vagal. The ventral vagal is associated with feelings of safety and social engagement, while the dorsal vagal is activated during life-threatening situations, leading to a shutdown response. When faced with a perceived threat, our nervous system first activates the sympathetic branch, preparing us for fight or flight. If the threat is overwhelming, the dorsal vagal may take over, causing us to freeze or collapse. Understanding these different nervous system states can help us develop strategies to regulate our responses to stress and trauma."

Post-Reading (20 mins):
- Check comprehension with questions like: "What are the two branches of the vagus nerve, and what are their roles?", "How does our nervous system typically respond to a perceived threat?", "Why is it important to understand the different nervous system states described in polyvagal theory?"
- Discuss how this information might be relevant to individuals who have experienced trauma or high levels of stress
- Brainstorm strategies for promoting a sense of safety and supporting nervous system regulation (e.g., deep breathing, mindfulness, social support)

Wrap-up (10 mins):
- Review the key vocabulary and concepts from the lesson
- Encourage students to reflect on how they can apply this knowledge to their own lives or to supporting others who may have experienced trauma

Homework:
- Have students write a short paragraph summarizing what they learned about polyvagal theory and its relevance to understanding trauma and nervous system regulation. Ask them to include at least three of the key vocabulary words in their paragraph.

Here's a Grammar Points section for the lesson plan, formatted as requested:

## Grammar Points:

- Reported Speech: Practice using reported speech when discussing research findings or expert opinions about trauma and polyvagal theory. For example: "Dr. Porges said that the vagus nerve has two branches."

- Conditional Sentences: Use conditional sentences to discuss hypothetical situations related to trauma responses. For instance: "If a person feels safe, their ventral vagal system will likely be activated."

- Passive Voice: Employ passive voice when describing physiological processes. Example: "The sympathetic nervous system is activated when a threat is perceived."

- Present Simple for Scientific Facts: Utilize the present simple tense when stating general truths about the nervous system. For example: "The autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary bodily functions."

- Cause and Effect Language: Practice using cause and effect structures to explain the relationship between trauma and nervous system responses. For instance: "As a result of experiencing trauma, some individuals may have an overactive sympathetic nervous system."
