Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn vocabulary related to subtle anatomy and energy systems
- Students will practice reading comprehension and discussion skills
- Students will understand the basic concepts of subtle anatomy and energy systems in the context of holistic healing

Warm-up (10 mins):
- Write the words "subtle anatomy" and "energy systems" on the board and ask students to share what they think these terms might mean
- Briefly discuss the idea that many holistic healing traditions believe in the existence of subtle energy systems within the body

Pre-Reading (10 mins):
- Introduce key vocabulary: subtle anatomy, energy systems, meridians, chakras, aura, prana, qi
- Have students discuss any experiences they may have had with practices that work with subtle energy, such as acupuncture, reiki, or yoga

Reading Activity (20 mins):
- Provide a simplified text explaining the basics of subtle anatomy and energy systems
- As they read, students should identify the main ideas and supporting details
- Text: "Many holistic healing traditions recognize the existence of subtle energy systems within the body, which are believed to play a vital role in overall health and well-being. These energy systems, sometimes referred to as subtle anatomy, include concepts such as meridians, chakras, and the aura. Meridians, as understood in Traditional Chinese Medicine, are pathways through which life energy, or qi, flows. Chakras, a concept from Indian yogic traditions, are believed to be energy centers located along the spine, each associated with specific physical, emotional, and spiritual qualities. The aura is thought to be a luminous energy field surrounding the body, reflecting an individual's overall state of health. Practices such as acupuncture, reiki, and yoga aim to balance and harmonize these subtle energy systems, promoting healing and wellness on all levels."

Post-Reading (20 mins):
- Check comprehension with questions like: "What are meridians, and what role do they play in Traditional Chinese Medicine?", "How are chakras understood in Indian yogic traditions?", "What is the aura, and what is it thought to reflect?"
- Discuss how the concept of subtle energy systems relates to a holistic understanding of health and well-being
- Brainstorm ways in which practices that work with subtle energy, such as acupuncture or reiki, might be incorporated into a holistic healing approach

Wrap-up (10 mins):
- Review the key vocabulary and concepts from the lesson
- Encourage students to reflect on their own experiences with or beliefs about subtle energy systems and how they might relate to their understanding of health and healing

Homework:
- Have students choose one subtle energy system (e.g., meridians, chakras, or the aura) and write a short paragraph describing its key features and how it is believed to influence health and well-being. Ask them to include at least three of the key vocabulary words in their paragraph.
