Teacher's Text (20 mins):
- The teacher reads the following text to the class:
"Throughout history, various cultures have developed unique perspectives on healing that reflect their beliefs, traditions, and understanding of the world. In this lesson, we will explore shamanism in Siberian cultures, ancient goddess religions in Mesopotamia and Greece, ethnic and cultural traditions in Timor Leste, and the healing traditions of the Shipibo and Quechua people of South America, the Norse culture of Scandinavia, the teachings of Lalleshwari from Kashmir, and the Hopi and Cherokee Native American tribes.

Shamanism has been practiced by various Siberian cultures, such as the Evenks, Yakuts, and Buryats, for centuries. In these cultures, shamans are believed to have the ability to communicate with the spirit world and harness spiritual energy for healing. They often use techniques such as drumming, chanting, and the use of medicinal plants to induce altered states of consciousness and facilitate healing.

In ancient Mesopotamia, around 3000 BCE, the goddess Inanna was revered as a deity associated with love, fertility, and healing. Similarly, in ancient Greece, around 600 BCE, the goddess Hygieia was worshipped as a symbol of health, cleanliness, and sanitation. These ancient goddess religions emphasized the nurturing and healing aspects of the divine feminine.

In Timor Leste, different ethnic groups have their own unique healing traditions. The Tetum people, the largest ethnic group in the country, believe in the power of traditional healers called 'matan dook,' who use a combination of herbal remedies, massage, and spiritual rituals to treat various ailments. The Mambai people, another ethnic group, have a strong belief in the connection between the physical and spiritual worlds, and their healing practices often involve offerings to ancestral spirits. The Fataluku people, who inhabit the eastern part of the country, have a tradition of using sacred caves for healing rituals and seeking guidance from ancestral spirits.

The Shipibo and Quechua people of the Amazon basin have a rich tradition of shamanic healing practices. Shipibo shamans, known as 'onanya,' use a combination of plant medicines, such as ayahuasca, and healing songs called 'icaros' to diagnose and treat illnesses. Similarly, Quechua shamans, or 'paqos,' use divination techniques and offerings to the nature spirits to restore balance and promote healing.

In Norse culture, healing was associated with the goddess Eir, who was known for her knowledge of medicinal herbs and her ability to heal the sick and wounded. Norse shamans, called 'sei√∞r,' used chanting, drumming, and herbs to communicate with the spirit world and facilitate healing.

Lalleshwari, also known as Lal Ded, was a 14th-century mystic and poet from Kashmir. Her teachings emphasized the importance of self-realization and the unity of all beings. She taught that true healing comes from within and that by recognizing the divine presence in oneself and others, one can attain a state of wholeness and well-being.

The Hopi and Cherokee Native American tribes have a holistic approach to healing that recognizes the interconnectedness of the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of life. Hopi healers, or 'qaqas,' use prayer, herbal remedies, and sacred ceremonies to restore balance and harmony. Cherokee healers, or 'didanvwisgi,' use a combination of plant medicines, prayer, and spiritual practices to promote healing and well-being.

Despite the diversity of these cultures, there are several common themes in their perspectives on healing:

1. Holistic approach: Many of these cultures recognize the interconnectedness of the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of life and seek to address imbalances in all these areas to promote healing.

2. Connection to nature: These cultures often view nature as a source of healing and use plants, animals, and natural elements in their healing practices.

3. Spiritual dimension: Healing is often seen as a spiritual process that involves communicating with the spirit world, ancestors, or divine beings to restore balance and promote well-being.

4. Importance of self-realization: Some of these cultures, such as the teachings of Lalleshwari, emphasize the importance of self-realization and the recognition of the divine presence within oneself as a key to true healing.

As we learn about these perspectives, it's essential to understand that they are deeply rooted in the cultural beliefs and traditions of their respective communities. By exploring these diverse approaches to healing, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of health and well-being, and appreciate the value of traditional knowledge in the context of modern healthcare."

Group Discussion (30 mins):
- Divide the class into small groups of 3-4 students
- Ask the students to discuss the following questions:
  1. What are some healing traditions or practices that have been passed down in your family or community?
  2. How do these traditions compare to the healing practices of the Tetum, Mambai, and Fataluku people of Timor Leste?
  3. Are there any similarities or differences between your family's traditions and the traditions of the cultures mentioned in the teacher's text (Siberian, Shipibo, Quechua, Norse, Lalleshwari, Hopi, and Cherokee)?
  4. How might understanding and respecting diverse healing traditions contribute to a more holistic approach to healthcare in Timor Leste?
- Have each group share their main discussion points with the class

Teacher-Led Discussion (15 mins):
- Facilitate a class discussion based on the groups' sharing
