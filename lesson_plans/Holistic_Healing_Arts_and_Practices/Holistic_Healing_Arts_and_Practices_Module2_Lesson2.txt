Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn vocabulary related to client intake, assessment, and documentation
- Students will practice conducting a client intake interview and assessment
- Students will understand the importance of thorough and accurate documentation
- Students will learn how to create and maintain client records

Warm-up (10 mins):
- Ask students to brainstorm what information they think is important to gather during a client intake and assessment
- Write their ideas on the board and discuss the purpose of collecting this information

Teacher's Text (20 mins):
- The teacher reads the following text to the class:

"Client intake, assessment, and documentation are crucial aspects of the therapeutic process. They help the healer gather necessary information, establish a baseline, and create a record of the client's progress over time.

The intake process typically involves an initial interview where the healer asks the client about their health history, current concerns, lifestyle habits, and treatment goals. Key areas to cover include:
- Identifying information (name, age, contact info)
- Chief complaint or reason for seeking treatment
- Medical history and current medications
- Family health history
- Lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, stress, sleep)
- Mental/emotional well-being
- Past treatments and their effectiveness

During the assessment, the healer evaluates the client's current condition through observation, palpation, and various diagnostic methods specific to their modality. This may include assessing posture, range of motion, tissue quality, pain levels, energy flow, and other relevant factors.

Throughout the intake and assessment, it's important to document all findings clearly and accurately in the client's record. This includes noting any subjective information the client shares, as well as objective data from the healer's evaluations. 

Good documentation practices include:
- Writing legibly and using clear, professional language
- Being specific and descriptive in your notes
- Noting the date, time, and duration of each session
- Recording any treatments provided and the client's response
- Maintaining client confidentiality and securing records appropriately

Thorough documentation serves several purposes:
- It allows the healer to track the client's progress over time
- It provides a record for future reference or if another healer takes over the case
- It may be necessary for insurance or legal purposes
- It supports clear communication if referring to another healthcare provider

Effective intake, assessment, and documentation skills are essential for providing high-quality, individualized care to clients. They form the foundation for treatment planning and help ensure continuity of care."

Small Group Activity (30 mins):
- Divide the class into groups of 3-4 students
- Provide each group with a sample client case study
- Have the groups work together to:
  1. Identify what information they would gather in an initial intake interview
  2. Conduct a mock assessment based on the case study details
  3. Document their findings and create a sample client record

- Have each group present their case and documentation to the class

Class Discussion (15 mins):
- As a class, discuss the following:
  - What did you find most challenging about the intake and assessment process?
  - What strategies did you use to document your findings clearly?
  - How might cultural considerations impact the intake and documentation process?
  - What questions do you still have about this topic?

Documentation Practice (15 mins):
- Provide students with several brief client scenarios
- Have them individually practice documenting an intake, assessment, and treatment plan for each scenario
- Encourage them to apply the best practices discussed in the lesson

Wrap-up (10 mins):
- Review the key vocabulary and concepts from the lesson
- Emphasize the importance of developing strong intake, assessment, and documentation skills
- Encourage students to continue practicing these skills in their own work with clients

Homework:
- Have students create a client intake and assessment template they can use in their own practice
- Ask them to conduct a mock intake interview with a friend or family member and document their findings
- Provide feedback on their templates and documentation in the next class

## Grammar Points:

- Use of third-person pronouns (he, she, they) when referring to clients in documentation to maintain professionalism and clarity. For example: "The client reported that she experiences frequent headaches."

- Proper use of possessive pronouns (his, her, their) when describing client information or belongings. For instance: "Document the client's medical history and their current medications."

- Consistent use of tenses, particularly present tense for current observations and past tense for historical information. Example: "The client presents with lower back pain. She stated that the pain began three weeks ago."

- Use of conditional sentences to discuss potential treatment plans or outcomes. For example: "If the client continues with the recommended exercises, their range of motion should improve."

- Appropriate use of passive voice in documentation to maintain objectivity and focus on the action rather than the doer. For instance: "The assessment was conducted, and the findings were recorded in the client's file."
