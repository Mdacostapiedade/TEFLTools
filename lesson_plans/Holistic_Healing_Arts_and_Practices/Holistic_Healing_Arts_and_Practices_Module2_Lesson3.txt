Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn vocabulary related to indications, contraindications, and scope of practice
- Students will understand the importance of identifying indications and contraindications for various healing modalities
- Students will recognize the limits of their scope of practice as healers
- Students will practice making decisions about appropriate treatment based on case scenarios

Warm-up (10 mins):
- Write the terms "indications," "contraindications," and "scope of practice" on the board
- Ask students to share their initial understanding of these terms and why they might be important in a healing context

Teacher's Text (20 mins):
- The teacher reads the following text to the class:

"As healers, it's crucial to understand when a particular treatment is likely to be helpful (indicated), when it might be harmful or unsafe (contraindicated), and what falls within your scope of practice. This knowledge helps ensure client safety and appropriate care.

Indications refer to the specific conditions or circumstances in which a certain treatment is known to be beneficial. For example, massage therapy is often indicated for reducing muscle tension, promoting relaxation, and relieving pain. 

Contraindications, on the other hand, are situations in which a treatment could be detrimental or dangerous. These can be absolute contraindications, meaning the treatment should never be used (e.g., massage on an area with a blood clot), or relative contraindications, where extra caution or modification is needed (e.g., lighter pressure on osteoporotic bones).

Common contraindications to be aware of include:
- Infectious diseases
- Uncontrolled hypertension 
- Certain medications (e.g., blood thinners)
- Open wounds or skin infections
- Malignant tumors
- Pregnancy (for some modalities)
- Acute injuries or inflammation
- Severe mental health conditions

It's important to thoroughly review a client's intake form and assess their current condition to identify any potential contraindications before proceeding with treatment.

Scope of practice refers to the range of services, treatments, and advice that a healer is qualified and legally permitted to provide based on their training, certification, and local regulations. Working within your scope of practice ensures that you're offering treatments you're competent in and not overstepping professional boundaries.

Examples of scope of practice considerations include:
- Not diagnosing medical conditions unless qualified to do so
- Referring clients to other providers when needed (e.g., for a serious injury or mental health crisis)
- Not claiming to cure diseases or making unrealistic promises
- Staying within your area of expertise and training
- Following all relevant laws and ethical guidelines

Maintaining clear boundaries and knowing when to refer out is essential for responsible and effective healing work. When in doubt, always prioritize client safety and consult with mentors or colleagues for guidance."

Case Study Discussion (30 mins):
- Present students with several client case studies that include a mix of indicated and contraindicated conditions for various healing modalities
- Divide the class into small groups and assign each group a case study
- Have the groups discuss:
  1. What indications or contraindications they identify in the case
  2. How they would proceed with treatment (if at all)
  3. Whether the case falls within their scope of practice
  4. What additional information they might need

- Have each group present their case and conclusions to the class for discussion

Role-Play Activity (20 mins):
- Divide the class into pairs
- Have each pair take turns role-playing a client intake interview, with one student as the healer and the other as a client with a complex health history
- The healer's goal is to identify any indications or contraindications and determine an appropriate treatment plan within their scope of practice
- Have the pairs switch roles and repeat the exercise

Reflection & Synthesis (15 mins):
- Give students time to write reflectively on what they've learned about indications, contraindications, and scope of practice
- Prompts:
  - Why is it important to consider these factors in your work as a healer?
  - What challenges might you face in identifying contraindications or staying within your scope of practice?
  - How will you ensure client safety and appropriate care in your practice?

- Invite students to share their reflections with the class

Wrap-up (5 mins):
- Review the key terms and concepts from the lesson
- Emphasize the healer's responsibility to prioritize client safety and work within their professional boundaries
- Encourage students to continue deepening their understanding of indications, contraindications, and scope of practice for their specific modalities

Homework:
- Provide students with a list of common health conditions
- Ask them to research and identify the indications and contraindications for their chosen healing modality in relation to these conditions
- Have them present their findings in small groups at the next class session

## Grammar Points:

- Use of conditional statements to discuss potential scenarios:
  - Zero conditional for general truths: "If a client has an infectious disease, massage is contraindicated."
  - First conditional for likely future scenarios: "If you encounter a contraindication, you will need to modify or cancel the treatment."
  - Second conditional for hypothetical situations: "If a client were to have uncontrolled hypertension, what would you do?"

- Modal verbs to express degrees of necessity, possibility, and advice:
  - "You must always prioritize client safety."
  - "Massage may be beneficial for reducing muscle tension."
  - "You should refer clients to other providers when necessary."

- Present perfect tense to discuss experience and knowledge:
  - "Have you ever encountered a contraindication in your practice?"
  - "I have learned about several indications for aromatherapy."

- Passive voice to emphasize actions and processes rather than the actor:
  - "Contraindications should be carefully assessed before treatment."
  - "The client's medical history must be thoroughly reviewed."

- Comparative and superlative forms to discuss treatment options:
  - "This treatment is more appropriate for the client's condition."
  - "The safest approach would be to refer the client to a specialist."
