Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn vocabulary related to boundaries, communication, and ethics in a healing context
- Students will understand the importance of establishing and maintaining clear boundaries with clients
- Students will practice effective communication techniques for working with clients
- Students will explore ethical considerations and dilemmas that may arise in their healing practice

Warm-up (10 mins):
- Ask students to brainstorm why boundaries, communication, and ethics might be important in a healing relationship
- Write their ideas on the board and discuss how these factors contribute to client safety and trust

Teacher's Text (20 mins):
- The teacher reads the following text to the class:

"Boundaries, communication, and ethics form the foundation of a safe, effective, and professional healing practice. By attending to these areas with care and skill, healers create a container of trust and integrity for their work with clients.

Boundaries refer to the physical, emotional, and energetic limits that define the healing relationship. They help ensure that interactions remain therapeutic and appropriate. Examples of important boundaries include:
- Maintaining client confidentiality
- Refraining from dual relationships (e.g., friendships or romantic involvement with clients)
- Respecting the client's personal space and privacy
- Keeping sessions within agreed-upon time limits
- Not engaging in inappropriate touch or sexual contact
- Being clear about the scope and limits of your services

Effective communication is essential for establishing boundaries, building rapport, and supporting clients' healing processes. Key communication skills include:
- Active listening and reflecting back what you hear
- Asking open-ended questions to elicit more information
- Using clear, direct language to explain procedures and techniques
- Checking for understanding and obtaining consent before treatment
- Offering choices and respecting the client's right to decline or modify treatment
- Providing a non-judgmental, empathetic presence

Ethical considerations involve navigating the complex moral territory of working intimately with people in a healing capacity. Healers must grapple with questions of power dynamics, cultural differences, and potential conflicts of interest. Some key ethical principles include:
- Beneficence: Striving to promote the client's well-being and avoid harm
- Non-maleficence: Refraining from any action that could cause harm
- Autonomy: Respecting the client's right to make informed choices about their care
- Justice: Treating all clients fairly and equitably, regardless of background or identity
- Veracity: Being truthful and accurate in your communication and representation of services

When ethical dilemmas arise, it's important to consult with colleagues, supervisors, or professional organizations for guidance. Having a clear decision-making framework and a commitment to ongoing self-reflection can help navigate these challenging situations with integrity."

Small Group Discussion (20 mins):
- Divide the class into groups of 4-5 students
- Assign each group one of the following scenarios:
  1. A client asks you to keep a secret from their family member who is paying for their sessions
  2. You feel a strong personal attraction to a client and wonder if it's okay to ask them out
  3. A client brings up a concern that you don't feel qualified to handle and asks for your advice
  4. You suspect a client may be involved in illegal activity or experiencing abuse

- Have each group discuss how they would respond to the scenario, considering boundaries, communication, and ethical principles
- Each group shares their scenario and key points with the class

Boundary Setting Practice (20 mins):
- Divide the class into pairs
- Have each pair practice setting clear boundaries in a mock healer-client interaction
- Provide prompts such as:
  - The client asks for your personal phone number
  - The client wants to extend the session beyond the scheduled time
  - The client requests a treatment you don't feel comfortable providing

- Have partners take turns being the healer and the client, then debrief together

Reflection & Action Planning (15 mins):
- Give students time to reflect individually on their own boundaries, communication skills, and ethical commitments
- Prompts:
  - What boundaries feel most important for you to maintain in your healing practice?
  - What communication skills do you want to strengthen?
  - What ethical principles will guide your decision-making?
  - How will you handle boundary crossings or ethical dilemmas that may arise?

- Have students write down 2-3 specific action steps they will take to develop their skills in these areas

Wrap-up (5 mins):
- Review the key concepts and vocabulary from the lesson
- Emphasize the ongoing nature of developing strong boundaries, communication, and ethical practices
- Encourage students to seek ongoing support, consultation, and learning opportunities in these areas

Homework:
- Have students research professional codes of ethics relevant to their healing modality
- Ask them to identify 3-5 key ethical principles that resonate with them and write a short reflection on how they will apply these in their work
- Discuss findings and reflections in small groups at the next class

## Grammar Points:

- Present Simple tense for stating general truths and principles: Use this tense when discussing ethical guidelines, boundary setting, and communication skills that are always applicable. For example, "Boundaries help ensure that interactions remain therapeutic and appropriate."

- Modal verbs for expressing obligation and possibility: Utilize modal verbs like "must," "should," and "may" when discussing ethical responsibilities and potential scenarios. For instance, "Healers must grapple with questions of power dynamics" or "Ethical dilemmas may arise in your practice."

- Conditional sentences for hypothetical situations: Use conditional structures when exploring potential ethical dilemmas or boundary issues. For example, "If a client asks for your personal phone number, how would you respond?"

- Present Perfect tense for discussing experience and ongoing practices: Employ this tense when talking about the development of skills or ethical awareness over time. For instance, "Have you ever encountered a situation where maintaining boundaries was challenging?"

- Future tenses for action planning: Use future forms like "will" or "going to" when discussing how students plan to implement what they've learned. For example, "I will establish clear boundaries with my clients from the beginning of our professional relationship."
