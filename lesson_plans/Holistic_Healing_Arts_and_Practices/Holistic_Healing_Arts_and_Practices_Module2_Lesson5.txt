Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn vocabulary related to cultural competence and humility in healing work
- Students will understand the importance of considering cultural context when working with clients
- Students will explore their own cultural identities and biases
- Students will practice strategies for providing culturally sensitive care

Warm-up (10 mins):
- Write the word "culture" on the board and ask students to brainstorm different aspects of culture (e.g., race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexuality, ability, etc.)
- Discuss how culture shapes our experiences, beliefs, and expectations related to health and healing

Teacher's Text (20 mins):
- The teacher reads the following text to the class:

"As healers, it's essential to recognize that our clients come from diverse cultural backgrounds that shape their understanding of health, illness, and treatment. To provide effective and respectful care, we must develop cultural competence and humility.

Cultural competence involves developing awareness, knowledge, and skills related to working with people from different cultural backgrounds. This includes:
- Being aware of your own cultural identity, biases, and privileges
- Learning about different cultural beliefs, practices, and communication styles
- Adapting your approach to meet the unique needs and preferences of each client
- Collaborating with cultural brokers or interpreters when needed

Cultural humility takes this a step further by acknowledging that we can never fully understand another person's culture. It involves:
- Approaching cultural differences with openness, curiosity, and respect
- Recognizing power imbalances and working to minimize them
- Being willing to learn from and be changed by our interactions with clients
- Engaging in ongoing self-reflection and learning

When working with clients from different cultural backgrounds, it's important to:
- Avoid stereotyping or making assumptions based on cultural generalizations
- Ask open-ended questions to understand the client's individual beliefs and preferences
- Explain concepts in clear, jargon-free language and check for understanding
- Be attuned to nonverbal cues and communication styles
- Respect cultural taboos, gender roles, and family dynamics
- Incorporate culturally meaningful elements into treatment when appropriate
- Be prepared to adapt or modify techniques to fit the client's cultural context

Developing cultural competence and humility is a lifelong process that requires ongoing self-reflection, education, and engagement with diverse communities. By committing to this work, healers can create more inclusive, equitable, and effective healing spaces for all."

Self-Reflection Activity (20 mins):
- Have students complete a cultural self-assessment worksheet that prompts them to reflect on their own cultural identities, biases, and experiences
- Questions might include:
  - What cultural groups do you belong to? How have these shaped your worldview?
  - What biases or stereotypes do you hold about certain cultural groups?
  - What experiences have you had interacting with people from different cultures?
  - How might your cultural background influence your approach to healing work?

- Have students pair up and share their reflections with a partner

Case Study Discussion (30 mins):
- Divide the class into small groups and give each group a case study involving a client from a different cultural background
- Example case: "A 60-year-old Vietnamese woman comes to you for help with chronic pain. She speaks limited English and seems hesitant to make eye contact or discuss personal matters."

- Have each group discuss:
  - What cultural factors might be important to consider in this case?
  - How might the healer adapt their approach to build trust and rapport with this client?
  - What resources or supports might be helpful in providing culturally responsive care?

- Have each group share their key insights and strategies with the class

Role-Play Activity (20 mins):
- Have students pair up and practice a mock healer-client interaction where cultural differences are present
- Prompt them to use strategies like asking open-ended questions, checking for understanding, and adapting communication style
- Have partners take turns being the healer and client, then debrief together

Wrap-up (10 mins):
- Review key vocabulary and concepts from the lesson
- Emphasize the importance of ongoing self-reflection, learning, and cultural humility in healing work
- Encourage students to continue exploring their own cultural identities and engaging with diverse communities

Homework:
- Have students research a specific cultural group they are less familiar with and prepare a short presentation on key health beliefs, practices, and communication styles for that group
- Assign readings or videos related to cultural competence in healthcare for discussion at the next class

Here's a Grammar Points section for the lesson plan, emphasizing the use of conjunctions in the context of cultural competence and humility:

## Grammar Points:

1. Using coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or) to connect related ideas about cultural competence:
   - Example: "Cultural competence involves awareness AND knowledge AND skills."

2. Employing subordinating conjunctions (because, although, while) to express relationships between cultural concepts:
   - Example: "ALTHOUGH we strive for cultural competence, we must also practice cultural humility BECAUSE we can never fully understand another person's culture."

3. Utilizing correlative conjunctions (both...and, not only...but also) to emphasize multiple aspects of cultural sensitivity:
   - Example: "Healers must BOTH be aware of their own cultural biases AND be open to learning from their clients' diverse backgrounds."

4. Using conjunctive adverbs (however, therefore, moreover) to transition between ideas related to cultural competence:
   - Example: "Cultural competence is essential; HOWEVER, it must be paired with cultural humility for truly effective healing work."

5. Incorporating conditional conjunctions (if, unless) to discuss potential cultural scenarios:
   - Example: "IF a client's cultural background differs significantly from the healer's, it may be necessary to seek additional resources or support."
