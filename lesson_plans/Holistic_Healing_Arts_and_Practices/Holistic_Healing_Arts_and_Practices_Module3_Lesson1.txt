- Students will practice describing the lymphatic system and self-massage techniques to a partner

Warm-up (10 mins):
- Show pictures of the lymphatic system and ask students to share what they know about it

- Provide simple definitions and examples for each word
- Have students practice pronouncing and using the new vocabulary in sentences

Reading Passage (30 mins):
- Adapt a short passage explaining the basics of the lymphatic system, such as:
  - The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and nodes that helps circulate fluid and fight infection
  - Lymph nodes filter the lymph fluid and trap harmful substances like bacteria and viruses
  - Sometimes the lymphatic system can become sluggish or congested, leading to swelling or illness
  - Gentle massage techniques can help stimulate lymphatic flow and boost overall health

- Read the passage aloud and check for understanding
- Have students take turns reading sections of the passage

- Guide students in practicing these techniques on themselves, focusing on proper direction and pressure
- Provide verbal cues and reminders to breathe deeply and massage gently
- Encourage students to notice any sensations or changes they feel in their body

Partner Practice and Discussion (30 mins):
- Have students pair up and take turns describing the lymphatic system and demonstrating the self-massage techniques to their partner
- Encourage partners to give each other feedback and ask questions to clarify understanding
- Have each pair discuss how they might incorporate these techniques into their daily routine and why it might be beneficial for their health

- Invite pairs to share key points from their discussions with the whole class

Reflection and Wrap-up (20 mins):
- Ask students to reflect on what they learned about the lymphatic system and self-massage
- Discuss how a healthy lymphatic system contributes to overall well-being and immunity
- Review the key vocabulary words and their meanings
- Provide a list of resources (e.g., diagrams, articles, videos) for students who want to learn more

Homework:
- Ask students to practice the self-massage techniques for at least 5 minutes a day and notice any changes in their energy or well-being
- Have them teach the techniques to a friend or family member and share their experience
- Invite students to bring any questions or insights to discuss at the next class
