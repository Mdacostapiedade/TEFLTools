Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn basic vocabulary related to the myofascial system and myofascial release (MFR)
- Students will understand the key principles and techniques of MFR
- Students will practice simple self-MFR techniques using foam rollers or balls
- Students will engage in partner discussions and reflections on their experiences with MFR

Introduction (10 mins):
- Show pictures or videos of people receiving MFR treatments
- Ask students to share any experiences they have with muscle tension, pain, or stiffness

Vocabulary Introduction (20 mins):
- Present key terms related to MFR, such as:
  - Fascia, connective tissue, restriction, release
  - Pressure, compression, stretch, sensation
  - Posture, flexibility, range of motion, relaxation

- Provide simple definitions and examples for each word
- Have students practice pronouncing and using the new vocabulary in sentences

Reading Passage (30 mins):
- Adapt a short passage explaining the basic principles of MFR, such as:
  - Fascia is a type of connective tissue that surrounds and supports our muscles
  - Sometimes fascia can become tight or restricted, causing pain and limiting movement
  - MFR involves applying gentle, sustained pressure to these restricted areas
  - The goal is to help the fascia soften, release, and allow for more ease and flexibility

- Read the passage aloud and check for understanding
- Have students take turns reading sections of the passage
- Discuss the main ideas and answer any questions that arise

Demonstration and Practice (40 mins):
- Show a video or live demonstration of simple self-MFR techniques using a foam roller or ball
- Guide students in practicing these techniques on themselves, focusing on common areas of tension (e.g., neck, shoulders, back, legs)
- Provide verbal cues and reminders to breathe, go slowly, and listen to their body's sensations
- Encourage students to notice any changes or releases they feel in their muscles and fascia

Partner Discussion (20 mins):
- Have students pair up and discuss their experiences with the self-MFR practice
- Provide prompts such as:
  - What did you notice in your body during the practice?
  - Which areas felt the most tense or restricted?
  - Did you feel any changes or releases in your muscles or fascia?
  - How do you feel overall after practicing self-MFR?

- Invite pairs to share highlights from their discussions with the whole class

Reflection and Wrap-up (20 mins):
- Ask students to reflect on what they learned about MFR and their own bodies
- Discuss how self-MFR techniques could be incorporated into their daily routines
- Review the key vocabulary words and their meanings
- Provide a list of resources (e.g., videos, articles, local MFR practitioners) for students who want to learn more

Homework:
- Ask students to practice self-MFR for at least 10 minutes a day, focusing on a different area of the body each time
- Have them keep a simple journal or record of their observations and experiences
- Invite students to share any insights, questions, or challenges at the next class
