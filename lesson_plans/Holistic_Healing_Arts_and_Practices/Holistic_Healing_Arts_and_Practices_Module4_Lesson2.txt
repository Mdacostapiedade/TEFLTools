Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn vocabulary related to somatic trauma and its impact on the body
- Students will understand the basic principles and benefits of somatic trauma releasing exercises
- Students will practice simple somatic exercises for self-regulation and stress relief
- Students will reflect on their own experiences with stress and the mind-body connection

Warm-up (10 mins):
- Ask students to share any experiences they have with stress or tension in their body
- Discuss how stress and trauma can affect both physical and mental well-being

Vocabulary Introduction (20 mins):
- Present key terms related to somatic trauma and releasing exercises, such as:
  - Trauma, stress, tension, dysregulation
  - Somatic, embodiment, self-regulation, resilience
  - Tremors, shaking, grounding, orienting

- Provide definitions and examples for each word in the context of somatic healing
- Have students practice pronouncing and using the new vocabulary in sentences

Reading and Discussion (30 mins):
- Provide a short reading on the basic principles and benefits of somatic trauma releasing exercises, such as:
  - Trauma and stress can get "stuck" in the body, leading to chronic tension and dysregulation
  - Somatic exercises help release this stored stress through gentle, mindful movement and awareness
  - These exercises can help regulate the nervous system, promote relaxation, and build resilience
  - Examples include tremoring, shaking, grounding, and orienting practices

- Read the passage aloud and check for understanding
- Have students take turns reading sections of the passage
- Discuss the main ideas and answer any questions that arise

Demonstration and Practice (30 mins):
- Guide students through a simple somatic trauma releasing exercise, such as a tremoring or shaking practice
- Provide clear instructions and demonstrations for the exercise
- Emphasize the importance of going slowly, staying within one's comfort zone, and listening to the body's sensations and feedback
- Have students practice the exercise for a few minutes, then pause to check in and share their experiences

Reflection and Discussion (30 mins):
- Ask students to reflect on their experience with the somatic exercise and any sensations or emotions that arose
- Discuss the potential challenges and benefits of incorporating somatic practices into daily life
- Explore how cultural attitudes and beliefs may influence perceptions of stress, trauma, and healing
- Encourage students to share their own self-care strategies and how they relate to the mind-body connection

Wrap-up (10 mins):
- Review the key vocabulary and concepts from the lesson
- Emphasize the importance of self-compassion and patience when working with somatic practices
- Provide resources for further learning about somatic trauma therapy and self-regulation techniques

Homework:
- Ask students to practice the somatic exercise learned in class for at least 5 minutes a day and keep a journal of their observations
- Have them write a short reflection on how stress and trauma manifest in their own bodies and lives, and how somatic practices might support their well-being
- Invite students to share their reflections and experiences at the next class

## Grammar Points:

- Reported Speech: Practice using reported speech to discuss experiences with stress and somatic exercises. For example, "Sarah said that she felt tension in her shoulders" or "The instructor explained that trauma can get stuck in the body."

- Present Perfect Tense: Use this tense to discuss past experiences that have a connection to the present, such as "I have experienced stress in my body" or "We have learned about somatic trauma releasing exercises."

- Conditional Sentences: Employ conditional sentences to discuss potential outcomes of somatic practices, like "If I practice these exercises regularly, I might feel more relaxed" or "What would happen if we incorporated somatic awareness into our daily routines?"

- Passive Voice: Utilize passive voice to describe processes related to somatic trauma and healing, such as "Stress can be stored in the body" or "Tension is often released through gentle movements."

- Adverbs of Frequency: Incorporate adverbs of frequency when discussing the regularity of practicing somatic exercises or experiencing stress, for example, "I often feel tense in my neck" or "She always does a grounding exercise before bed."
