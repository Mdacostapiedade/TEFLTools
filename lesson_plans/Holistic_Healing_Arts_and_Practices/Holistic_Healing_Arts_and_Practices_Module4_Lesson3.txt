Reading and Discussion (30 mins):
- Provide a short reading on the basic principles and benefits of breathwork for self-regulation, such as:
  - The breath is closely tied to the nervous system and can influence our stress response
  - Deep, slow breathing can activate the parasympathetic nervous system and promote relaxation

- Encourage students to share their own strategies for managing stress and promoting well-being

Wrap-up (10 mins):
- Review the key vocabulary and concepts from the lesson
- Emphasize the power of the breath as a simple, accessible tool for self-regulation and resilience
- Provide resources for further learning about breathwork and stress management techniques

Homework:
- Ask students to practice the breathing exercise learned in class for at least 5 minutes a day and keep a journal of their observations
- Have them write a short reflection on how stress manifests in their own lives and how breathwork might support their well-being
- Invite students to share their reflections and experiences at the next class
