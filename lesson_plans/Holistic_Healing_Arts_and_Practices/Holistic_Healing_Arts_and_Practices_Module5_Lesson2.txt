Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn vocabulary related to alternative health treatments and their potential benefits
- Students will understand the basic principles and applications of balneotherapy, DMSO, methylene blue, and activated charcoal
- Students will practice reading and discussing information about these treatments
- Students will reflect on their own experiences or opinions regarding alternative health approaches

Warm-up (10 mins):
- Ask students to brainstorm different types of alternative or complementary health treatments they are familiar with
- Write their ideas on the board and briefly discuss the potential benefits and limitations of alternative approaches

Vocabulary Introduction (25 mins):
- Present key terms related to balneotherapy, DMSO, methylene blue, and activated charcoal, such as:
  - Mineral springs, hot springs, hydrotherapy

- Have students practice pronouncing and using the new vocabulary in sentences

Jigsaw Reading Activity (50 mins):
- Divide the class into four groups and assign each group one of the following topics:
  1. Balneotherapy: the use of mineral-rich water for healing
  2. DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide): a natural compound with pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory properties
  3. Methylene blue: a synthetic compound with antioxidant and neuroprotective effects
  4. Activated charcoal: a highly porous substance used for detoxification and digestive health

- Provide each group with a short reading passage about their assigned topic, covering its history, mechanisms of action, potential benefits, and risks
- Have each group read and discuss their passage, identifying key information and vocabulary
- Rearrange the groups so that each new group has one member from each of the original topic groups
- Have students take turns teaching their topic to their new group members, using the information and vocabulary from their reading

Class Discussion (25 mins):
- As a class, discuss the potential benefits and limitations of each treatment, based on the information shared in the jigsaw activity
- Encourage students to ask questions, share their own experiences or opinions, and consider the cultural or scientific perspectives on these approaches
- Explore the importance of consulting with healthcare professionals and using caution when trying new treatments

Reflection and Wrap-up (15 mins):
- Have students write a short reflection on whether they would consider trying one of these treatments and why or why not
- Invite volunteers to share their reflections with the class
