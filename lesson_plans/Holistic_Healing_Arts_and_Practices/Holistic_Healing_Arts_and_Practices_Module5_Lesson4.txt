Reading Passage (30 mins):
- Give students a short text about the science behind color and light therapies, such as:

Jigsaw Activity (40 mins):

Wrap-up (5 mins):
- Recap the key vocabulary and concepts learned 
- Encourage students to notice color and light in their environment and how it makes them feel
- Challenge students to experiment with using color or light to influence their mood or energy

Extension:
