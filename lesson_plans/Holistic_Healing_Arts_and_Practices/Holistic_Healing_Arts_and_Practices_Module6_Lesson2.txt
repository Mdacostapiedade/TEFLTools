Wrap-Up (1 min):
"As women, we must root our power not in renunciation of self but in the honest pursuit of self-knowledge, self-respect, and self-love." - Bell Hooks
This quote from the renowned feminist scholar bell hooks gets to the heart of why self-care is a feminist issue. For too long, women have been taught that being selfless, self-negating, and putting everyone else's needs first is the ideal. But hooks states powerfully that true female empowerment comes from the "honest pursuit" of knowing ourselves deeply, respecting our inherent worth, and ultimately loving ourselves fully.

This lesson covers an important aspect of the Women's Health module, contextualizing feminine care within a holistic healing framework. It aims to provide factual education while opening up a respectful discussion around cultural attitudes, taboos, and the pursuit of menstrual dignity. Hands-on activities and practices reinforce self-care tools students can use.

## Grammar Points:

- Use of possessive adjectives (my, her, our) when discussing personal experiences and body parts related to feminine hygiene (e.g., "My menstrual cycle is regular," "Her self-care routine includes meditation").

- Practice using the present simple tense for describing regular habits and routines related to self-care (e.g., "I change my pad every four hours," "She takes iron supplements during her period").

- Employ modal verbs (can, should, might) to discuss recommendations and possibilities for feminine hygiene practices (e.g., "You can try using a menstrual cup," "Women should wash their hands before and after changing sanitary products").

- Utilize the passive voice when discussing societal attitudes and cultural practices (e.g., "Menstruation is often stigmatized in many cultures," "Feminine hygiene products are not always readily available").

- Punctuation: Practice using quotation marks for direct quotes from the reading or guest speaker, colons to introduce lists of self-care practices or hygiene products, and commas in compound sentences when discussing multiple aspects of feminine health and hygiene.
