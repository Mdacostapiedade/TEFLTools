Warm-up (10 mins):

Ask students to share any prior knowledge or experiences related to pregnancy/birth
Introduce the classic book "What to Expect When You're Expecting" as the main resource

Vocabulary Preview (15 mins):

Present a list of key vocabulary words like trimester, ultrasound, contractions, dilated, epidural, etc.
Have students use dictionaries/translations to define the words

Trimester
A trimester is one of the three 3-month periods into which a pregnancy is divided. The three trimesters are:
1st trimester - Weeks 1-12
2nd trimester - Weeks 13-27
3rd trimester - Weeks 28-40
Ultrasound
An ultrasound is a diagnostic imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of the baby and mother's reproductive organs during pregnancy. It allows doctors to monitor the baby's growth and development.
Contractions
Contractions are periodic tightenings of the muscles in the uterus which cause discomfort or pain. They help open (dilate) the cervix and push the baby out during labor and childbirth.
Dilated
Dilated refers to the gradual opening and thinning of the cervix during labor. As contractions intensify, the cervix dilates or widens from 0 to 10 centimeters to allow the baby to descend into the birth canal.
Epidural
An epidural is a type of regional anesthesia used during labor to relieve pain. An anesthetic medication is injected through a catheter into the epidural space around the spinal cord in the lower back. It numbs the body from the abdomen down while the mother remains awake.
The Three Trimesters (25 mins):

Explain the concept of trimesters and the breakdown of the 9 months (see Trimesters.txt in Readings folder)
Describe the typical milestones and changes in each trimester
What symptoms, challenges and self-care needs arise in each phase

The Birth Process (30 mins):

Describe the onset of labor (see the Childbirth.txt in the Readings folder) - the stages of dilation and effacement
Explain pain management options like breathing, massage, medications
Discuss the actual childbirth - when to push, potential interventions
