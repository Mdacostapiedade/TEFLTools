Warm-up (10 minutes):
- Write "Clinical Practice" and "Community Work" on the board. Ask students to brainstorm words or phrases they associate with each term.
- Discuss the students' ideas and introduce the lesson topic.

Vocabulary (20 minutes):
- Introduce key vocabulary related to clinical practice and community work (e.g., private practice, public health, outreach, patient, client, community center, clinic).
- Provide examples of each term in context and have students practice using them in sentences.
- Divide students into pairs to complete a matching activity with vocabulary words and definitions.

Reading and Discussion (30 minutes):
- Distribute case studies of healers working in clinical and community settings.
- Have students read the case studies individually and answer comprehension questions.
- Divide the class into small groups to discuss the advantages and challenges of each career path, using the case studies as examples.
- Groups share their main discussion points with the class.

Role-play (20 minutes):
- Divide students into pairs. One student will play the role of a healer, while the other plays a client or community member.
- Provide scenarios for each pair, such as a healer explaining their services in a clinical setting or a healer discussing a community outreach program.
- Have students switch roles and practice different scenarios.

Wrap-up (10 minutes):
- Review the main points of the lesson and the key vocabulary.
- Encourage students to reflect on which career path they find most appealing and why.
- Assign homework: Write a short paragraph comparing clinical practice and community work, using the lesson's vocabulary and concepts.

Here's a Grammar Points section for the lesson plan, formatted as requested:

## Grammar Points:

- Reported Speech: Practice using reported speech when discussing case studies or role-play scenarios. For example, "The healer said that she preferred working in a clinical setting" or "The community member reported that the outreach program had improved their health."

- Comparative and Superlative Adjectives: Use these when comparing clinical practice and community work. For instance, "Clinical practice can be more lucrative than community work" or "Community work is often the most rewarding for healers who enjoy public engagement."

- Modal Verbs for Possibility and Necessity: Incorporate modal verbs when discussing career options and requirements. Examples include "A healer might need additional certifications to work in a clinical setting" or "Community healers must be able to adapt to various environments."

- Conditional Sentences: Use conditional sentences to explore hypothetical situations in both career paths. For example, "If a healer works in a community setting, they would have the opportunity to reach a broader audience" or "Had she chosen clinical practice, she would have had a different set of challenges."

- Present Perfect vs. Simple Past: Utilize these tenses when discussing healers' experiences and career paths. For instance, "She has worked in community outreach for five years" (present perfect) vs. "She worked in a private clinic last year" (simple past).
