Lesson Plan: Module 7 - Healing Career Considerations
Topic: Implementing culturally-resonant healing protocols

Objectives:
- Students will understand the importance of culturally-resonant healing protocols.
- Students will learn strategies for incorporating cultural traditions and beliefs into their healing practices.
- Students will gain vocabulary related to cultural competence and sensitivity in healing.

Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with vocabulary and discussion questions
- Case studies of culturally-resonant healing practices
- Videos showcasing healers working within specific cultural contexts

Warm-up (10 minutes):
- Write "Culture" and "Healing" on the board. Ask students to share examples of how culture can influence healing practices.
- Discuss the students' ideas and introduce the lesson topic.

Vocabulary (20 minutes):
- Introduce key vocabulary related to cultural competence and sensitivity (e.g., cultural awareness, cultural humility, traditional healing, cultural adaptation, cultural beliefs).
- Provide examples of each term in context and have students practice using them in sentences.
- Divide students into pairs to create mini-dialogues using the new vocabulary.

Video and Discussion (30 minutes):
- Show short video clips of healers working within specific cultural contexts, explaining how they adapt their practices to align with local traditions and beliefs.
- Divide the class into small groups to discuss the videos, focusing on the strategies used to implement culturally-resonant healing protocols.
- Groups share their main takeaways with the class.

Case Study Analysis (30 minutes):
- Distribute case studies of culturally-resonant healing practices from various communities.
- Have students work in pairs to read and analyze the case studies, identifying the specific ways in which the healers incorporated cultural elements into their work.
- Pairs share their findings with the class, and the teacher facilitates a discussion on the importance of cultural competence in healing.

Wrap-up (10 minutes):
- Review the main points of the lesson and the key vocabulary.
- Encourage students to reflect on how they can incorporate cultural awareness and sensitivity into their own healing practices.
- Assign homework: Write a short essay discussing the benefits of implementing culturally-resonant healing protocols and propose strategies for doing so in a specific cultural context.

## Grammar Points:

- Word Formation: Practice forming adjectives from nouns related to culture and healing (e.g., culture → cultural, tradition → traditional, resonance → resonant). This helps students describe cultural aspects of healing more accurately.

- Conditional Sentences: Use conditional structures to discuss hypothetical scenarios in culturally-sensitive healing practices (e.g., "If a healer were working in a different cultural context, they would need to adapt their approach.").

- Passive Voice: Employ passive constructions to describe healing practices and protocols (e.g., "Traditional methods are often incorporated into modern healing practices."). This allows for a focus on the action rather than the actor.

- Comparative and Superlative Forms: Use these forms to compare different cultural approaches to healing (e.g., "Some healing practices are more widely accepted in certain cultures than in others.").

- Gerunds and Infinitives: Practice using gerunds and infinitives to discuss healing activities and goals (e.g., "Implementing culturally-resonant protocols involves understanding local traditions." or "To become culturally competent, healers need to study diverse healing practices.").
