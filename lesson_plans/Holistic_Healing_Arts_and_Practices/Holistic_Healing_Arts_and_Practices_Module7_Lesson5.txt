## Grammar Points:

- Use of conditional tenses when discussing potential business scenarios (e.g., "If you choose this location, you might attract more clients.")

- Proper use of possessive pronouns when referring to business ownership and management (e.g., "Your practice," "Their marketing strategy," "Our financial records")

- Employing the passive voice to describe business processes and regulations (e.g., "Licenses are required," "Taxes must be paid," "Services are offered")

- Correct use of subject pronouns when discussing various stakeholders in the healing arts business (e.g., "They (clients) expect quality service," "We (practitioners) must maintain ethical standards," "It (the business) requires careful planning")

- Utilizing object pronouns when describing interactions with clients and partners (e.g., "Serve them ethically," "Build trust with her," "Market to us effectively")
