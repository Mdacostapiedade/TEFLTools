        "When we talk about the mental health benefits of yoga, dance, tai chi and exercise some of this release is because with all of these we are working the fascia." - https://www.drlizaegbogah.com/blog/fascia-myofascial-release-emotional-trauma
        
        "Myofascial release is one of the most effective forms of therapy to release stored up emotional trauma from our body." - https://www.drlizaegbogah.com/blog/fascia-myofascial-release-emotional-trauma
        
        "The fascia is a semiconducting communication network that can convey the bioelectric signals between every part of the body and every other part." - James Oschman, author of "Energy Medicine: The Scientific Basis"
        
        "When we experience trauma, our bodies can become stuck in a state of hypervigilance, and this can be reflected in the tension and holding patterns within our fascial network." - Robert Schleip, author of "Fascia: The Tensional Network of the Human Body"
        
        "Myofascial release is a hands-on soft tissue technique that facilitates a stretch into the restricted fascia. A sustained pressure is applied into the restricted tissue barrier; after 90-120 seconds the tissue will undergo histological length changes allowing the first release to be felt." - John Barnes, physical therapist and author of "Myofascial Release: The Search for Excellence"
        
        "Fascia is the biological fabric that holds us together, the connective tissue network. You are about 70 trillion cells all humming in relative harmony; fascia is the 3D spider web of fibrous, gluey, and wet proteins that hold them all together." - Tom Myers, author of "Anatomy Trains"
        
        "Fascia forms a whole-body continuous three-dimensional matrix of structural support. It interpenetrates and surrounds all organs, muscles, bones, and nerve fibers, creating a unique environment for body systems functioning." - Robert Schleip, author of "Fascia: The Tensional Network of the Human Body"
        
        "Fascia seems to combine the property of a sol-liquid conductor and of a crystal generator system, which can generate and conduct direct currents as well as vibrations. A consequence of such communication is that every process occurring anywhere in the organism produces a characteristic pattern of vibrations that travel widely, distributing regulatory information." - (Oschman, 2009)
        
        "The information encoded in cell and tissue structure and activity may be read holographically, by tuning to the appropriate frequencies. This may even lead to a recall of past traumas and of an array of related sensations." - (https://www.bodyworkmovementtherapies.com/article/S1360-8592%2813%2900192-7/fulltext)
        
        "Fascia is like a copper wire that connects all the lights in your house. If there's a kink in the wire, the whole circuit is affected." - Tom Myers, author of "Anatomy Trains"


Lesson Objectives:

Students will understand the role of fascia as a whole-body communication network and its potential for storing emotional trauma
Students will learn about how myofascial release can help release stored tension and promote healing
Students will explore the concept of tissue memory and its implications for manual therapy practice

Presentation (30 mins):

Introduce the concept of fascia as a continuous, whole-body matrix that surrounds and interpenetrates all structures in the body.
Watch one of the videos.

Discussion ideas;
Discuss the role of fascia as a semiconducting communication network capable of transmitting bioelectric signals and vibrational information throughout the body
Explain how trauma is potentially stored emotional memories in the fascial tissue
Describe the process of myofascial release and how it can help release restricted fascia, promoting tissue change and the potential release of stored trauma
Explore the concept of tissue memory and the experiences of bodyworkers who have encountered phenomena suggestive of the release of memory traces during manual therapy
Discuss the idea that fascia may act as a liquid crystalline medium capable of storing and transmitting information holographically, potentially allowing access to past traumas and related sensations through appropriate frequency tuning

"Fascia wraps our bones, muscles, organs, our brain, our circulation and lymphatic system. It's like a spider web that goes from liquid to crystaline. It interconnectects all our parts.
Trauma or a really bad experience can get stuck in our fascia. Our sympathetic nervous system picks up on the crystaline signal and puts you in a state of fight/flight or shutdown if you hit a trigger event that is like the visceral stimuli present when the initial trauma occured.
Here are a few quotes..."

Small Group Discussion (20 mins):

Divide students into small groups and have them discuss the following questions:

How might the understanding of fascia as a whole-body communication network change the way we approach manual therapy and the treatment of emotional trauma?
What are some potential mechanisms by which emotional trauma could be stored in the fascial network, and how might myofascial release facilitate the release of this stored tension?
How can the concept of tissue memory inform the development of new manual therapy techniques or treatment strategies, and what are some potential challenges or limitations to consider?

Wrap-up (10 mins):

Have each group share the main points of their discussion with the class
Clarify any questions or misconceptions that arise
Emphasize the importance of understanding the role of fascia in emotional trauma and the potential of myofascial release and other manual therapies to promote healing and well-being

Vocabulary:

Myofascial (adj) - Relating to the muscle tissue (myo) and the connective tissue that surrounds it (fascia)
Fascia (noun) - A band or sheet of connective tissue, primarily collagen, beneath the skin that attaches, stabilizes, encloses, and separates muscles and other internal organs
Thixotropic (adj) - Describing a substance that becomes less viscous when subjected to an applied stress, such as agitation or shear stress
Piezoelectric effect (noun) - The ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress, or to generate mechanical stress in response to an applied electric field
Exclusion zone (EZ) water (noun) - A fourth phase of water, distinct from solid, liquid, and vapor, that forms a crystalline gel-like structure and exhibits unique properties, such as increased viscosity and charge separation
