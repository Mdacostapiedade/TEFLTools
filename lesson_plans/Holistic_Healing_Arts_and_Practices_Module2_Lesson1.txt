Lesson Objectives:

Students will learn vocabulary related to the therapeutic relationship and presence
Students will practice listening comprehension and discussion skills
Students will understand the basic concepts of holding healing space and therapeutic presence
Students will reflect on ways to create a healing environment and be fully present with clients

Warm-up (10 mins):

Write the phrase "holding healing space" on the board. Ask students what they think it means and what qualities or actions might help create a healing space.
Briefly discuss the importance of the healer's presence and the therapeutic relationship in any healing interaction.

Teacher's Text (20 mins):

The teacher reads the following text to the class:

"One of the most important aspects of being an effective healer is the ability to hold healing space and maintain a therapeutic presence. Holding space means creating a safe, non-judgmental environment where the client feels heard, respected and cared for. It's about meeting them where they are with compassion and supporting their innate healing process.
Key elements of holding space include:

Establishing a warm, welcoming atmosphere in the healing space
Bringing your full attention and presence to the client
Actively listening with empathy and without judgment
Allowing the client to go at their own pace; not rushing the process
Respecting the client's boundaries and right to make their own choices
Holding an intention for the client's highest good

Therapeutic presence is the quality of being fully engaged and attuned to what is happening with the client moment to moment. It means setting aside your own agenda, preconceptions or distractions to be completely available to the client and their experience. Some aspects of presence are:

Grounding yourself and settling your own mind and body
Connecting with a sense of openness, curiosity and caring
Paying attention to verbal and non-verbal cues from the client
Noticing your own internal responses but not getting caught up in them
Trusting the process and allowing things to unfold organically
Being responsive and flexible in the moment

Cultivating this strong therapeutic container and healing presence is a skill that takes ongoing practice and self-reflection. It also requires the healer to do their own personal growth work and take good care of themselves so they can show up fully for their clients. Some practices that support this are:

Developing a daily meditation or mindfulness routine
Taking time in nature to ground and refresh yourself
Seeking out your own healing sessions or supervision support
Setting clear boundaries and not overextending yourself
Continuing to learn and expand your skills and awareness

The quality of the relationship and the presence you bring is at the heart of the healing process. By tending to these with great care and humility, you create the optimal conditions for transformation and well-being to emerge."
Pair & Share (15 mins):

Divide the class into pairs. Have each pair discuss:

What stood out to you from the reading about holding space and presence?
How would you go about creating a healing environment for a client?
What do you think would be most challenging for you in bringing therapeutic presence?


Come back together as a class and have a few pairs share highlights of their discussion.

Role Play Activity (30 mins):

Divide the class into groups of 3. One student will play the healer, one the client, and one an observer.
Give them a simple prompt, such as the client is coming in with stress and muscle tension from a difficult work situation. The healer's aim is to create a healing space, be fully present and use some of the elements discussed to support the client.
Have them role play the scenario for about 5 minutes, then take a few minutes for the observer to give feedback.
Then have them switch roles and repeat 2 more times until everyone has had a turn in each role.
Come back together as a class and debrief. What was it like to hold space and be present in this way? What worked well? What was challenging? What did you notice as the client and observer?

Reflection Journal (10 mins):

Give students time to write reflectively on their key takeaways from the lesson. Prompts:

What does holding healing space and therapeutic presence mean to you now?
What is one thing you want to put into practice to develop your capacity in this area?
What further questions do you have?



Wrap-up (5 mins):

Review the key vocabulary and concepts from the lesson
Encourage students to notice their own presence and capacity for holding space in their daily lives and interactions
Emphasize that this is a lifelong learning edge that will continue to deepen for them over time as healers.

Homework:

Have students identify 3 simple practices they can implement this week to cultivate healing presence (e.g. 5 mins of meditation each morning, mindful listening with a friend, self-care activity). Ask them to keep a short log of their experiences to share next class.
