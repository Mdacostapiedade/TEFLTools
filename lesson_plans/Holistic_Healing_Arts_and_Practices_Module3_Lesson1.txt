Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn the basic anatomy and physiology of the lymphatic system
- Students will understand the role of the lymphatic system in immune function and overall health
- Students will learn hands-on techniques for stimulating lymphatic flow and drainage
- Students will practice lymphatic drainage techniques on each other and receive feedback

Warm-up (10 mins):
- Show a short video or diagram of the lymphatic system and how it relates to the immune system
- Ask students to share any personal experiences they've had with swollen lymph nodes or lymphatic issues

Lecture (30 mins):
- Explain the structure and function of the lymphatic system, including:
  - Lymph vessels and nodes
  - Lymph fluid composition and flow
  - Role in immune surveillance and response
  - Relationship to the circulatory system

- Discuss common conditions related to lymphatic dysfunction, such as:
  - Lymphedema
  - Chronic infections
  - Autoimmune disorders
  - Cancer

- Introduce the benefits of manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) for supporting lymphatic function, including:
  - Reducing edema and swelling
  - Boosting immune function
  - Promoting relaxation
  - Detoxifying the body

- Explain the basic principles and techniques of MLD, such as:
  - Using gentle, rhythmic strokes to stimulate lymph flow
  - Following the direction of lymphatic pathways
  - Clearing the nodes before working on the surrounding tissues
  - Adapting pressure and speed based on the client's needs

Demonstration (20 mins):
- Demonstrate a basic lymphatic drainage sequence on a volunteer student, narrating each step and technique
- Show how to:
  - Assess the client's lymphatic health and areas of congestion
  - Position the client for optimal drainage
  - Perform clearing strokes on the lymph nodes
  - Use specific techniques for the face, neck, arms, abdomen, and legs
  - Integrate breathing and relaxation cues

- Allow time for students to ask questions and take notes

Practice Session (50 mins):
- Divide the class into pairs and have them take turns practicing lymphatic drainage techniques on each other
- Provide a handout with step-by-step instructions and pictures for reference
- Circulate among the pairs to offer guidance, feedback, and adjustments
- Encourage students to give each other constructive feedback on pressure, pace, and flow

- Have students switch roles halfway through so each person gets to practice giving and receiving

Group Discussion (20 mins):
- Bring the class back together and lead a discussion on their experiences practicing MLD
- Ask students to share:
  - What did it feel like to give and receive lymphatic drainage?
  - What challenges or questions came up during practice?
  - How might they adapt the techniques for different clients or conditions?

- Discuss how to integrate lymphatic drainage into a holistic treatment plan, along with other modalities and lifestyle recommendations

Closing (10 mins):
- Summarize the key points from the lecture and practice session
- Emphasize the importance of proper technique, client communication, and scope of practice when performing MLD
- Encourage students to continue practicing and refining their skills outside of class

Homework:
- Assign reading on the lymphatic system and related disorders from the course textbook
- Have students research a specific condition that may benefit from MLD and write a short summary of their findings
- Ask students to practice the MLD sequence on at least two friends or family members before the next class
