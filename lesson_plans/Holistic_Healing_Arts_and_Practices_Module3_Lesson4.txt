Lesson Objectives:
- Students will understand the anatomy and physiology of the myofascial system
- Students will learn the principles and techniques of myofascial release (MFR)
- Students will explore the concepts of tissue unwinding and rebounding in MFR
- Students will practice MFR techniques on themselves and each other

Introduction (10 mins):
- Begin with a brief overview of the goals and format of the class
- Ask students to share any prior knowledge or experiences with myofascial work

Lecture (45 mins):
- Explain the structure and function of the myofascial system, including:
  - The composition and properties of fascia
  - The role of fascia in posture, movement, and pain
  - The concept of myofascial restrictions and their effects on the body

- Discuss the key principles and techniques of myofascial release, such as:
  - Applying sustained, gentle pressure to restricted areas
  - Waiting for the tissue to soften and release on its own
  - Following the tissue's inherent movements and directions of ease
  - Using different tools and positions to access various layers of fascia

- Introduce the concepts of unwinding and rebounding in MFR, including:
  - The phenomenon of spontaneous tissue movements or sensations during release
  - The importance of allowing and following these unwinding patterns
  - The rebound effect that can occur after a release, as tissues adjust to a new state

- Describe the potential benefits and applications of MFR, such as:
  - Reducing pain and tension in the body
  - Improving posture, flexibility, and range of motion
  - Enhancing circulation and lymphatic flow
  - Promoting relaxation and parasympathetic activation

Demonstration (30 mins):
- Invite a volunteer student to receive a brief MFR session from you
- Demonstrate the key techniques and principles of MFR, such as:
  - Using different hand positions and tools (e.g., knuckles, elbows, foam rollers)
  - Sinking slowly into the tissue and waiting for a release
  - Following the tissue's inherent movements and unwinding patterns
  - Responding to any rebound effects or shifts in the client's body

- Highlight any important safety considerations or contraindications for MFR
- Allow time for students to ask questions and share their observations

Practice Session (60 mins):
- Guide students in practicing some self-MFR techniques using foam rollers or balls
- Divide the class into pairs and have them take turns giving and receiving MFR to each other
- Provide guidance and feedback on their technique, pressure, and body mechanics
- Encourage students to tune into the subtle sensations and responses in the tissue
- Have students experiment with different tools, positions, and areas of the body

Group Discussion (30 mins):
- Invite students to share their experiences and reflections from the practice session
- Ask prompting questions such as:
  - What did you notice in your own body during self-MFR and partner work?
  - What challenges or insights arose for you as a practitioner or recipient?
  - How might MFR be integrated with other modalities or movement practices?

- Discuss the importance of self-care, body awareness, and professional boundaries in MFR

Closing (15 mins):
- Lead a final integration exercise, such as a guided meditation or group stretch
- Review the key concepts and techniques covered in the class
- Provide resources for further study and training in MFR, such as books, videos, or workshops
- Encourage students to continue exploring MFR in their personal and professional lives

Homework:
- Ask students to practice self-MFR for at least 15 minutes per day and keep a journal of their observations
- Assign reading on the myofascial system and MFR research from the course materials
- Invite students to share a case study or reflection on their MFR experiences at the next class
