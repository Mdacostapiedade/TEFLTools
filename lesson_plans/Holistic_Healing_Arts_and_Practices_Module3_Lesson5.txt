Lesson Objectives:
- Students will understand the basic principles and history of acupressure and trigger point therapy
- Students will learn the location and function of key acupressure points and trigger points
- Students will practice palpation and pressure techniques for addressing specific conditions
- Students will understand safety considerations and contraindications for acupressure and trigger point therapy

Introduction (10 mins):
- Begin with a brief centering or grounding exercise to bring awareness to the body
- Ask students to share any prior knowledge or experiences with acupressure or trigger point therapy

Lecture (45 mins):
- Explain the origins and theoretical foundations of acupressure and trigger point therapy, including:
  - The concept of qi or life force energy in Traditional Chinese Medicine
  - The relationship between acupressure points, meridians, and organ systems
  - The definition and characteristics of myofascial trigger points
  - The role of trigger points in pain, tension, and referred sensations

- Discuss the key principles and techniques of acupressure and trigger point therapy, such as:
  - Using firm, sustained pressure on specific points to release tension and promote healing
  - Locating acupressure points and trigger points through palpation and client feedback
  - Applying pressure using fingers, knuckles, elbows, or tools like acupressure pens
  - Incorporating breathing, stretching, and movement to enhance the effects of pressure

- Introduce some common acupressure points and their indications, such as:
  - LI4 for headaches, facial pain, and constipation
  - ST36 for digestive issues, fatigue, and immune support
  - GB20 for neck pain, headaches, and eye strain
  - LV3 for stress, anxiety, and menstrual cramps

- Describe the potential benefits and applications of acupressure and trigger point therapy, such as:
  - Reducing pain and muscle tension
  - Improving circulation and lymphatic flow
  - Balancing the nervous system and promoting relaxation
  - Enhancing sleep, digestion, and overall well-being

Demonstration (30 mins):
- Invite a volunteer student to receive a brief acupressure and trigger point session from you
- Demonstrate the techniques for locating and releasing specific points, such as:
  - Using the "search and destroy" method to find active trigger points
  - Applying gradual, steady pressure to the point until a release is felt
  - Incorporating breath, movement, or stretching to facilitate the release
  - Checking in with the client about their sensations and comfort level

- Highlight any important safety considerations, such as avoiding certain points during pregnancy or in cases of acute injury
- Allow time for students to ask questions and practice locating the demonstrated points on themselves

Practice Session (60 mins):
- Divide the class into pairs and have them take turns giving and receiving acupressure and trigger point therapy
- Provide a handout or chart of key acupressure points and trigger point locations for common conditions
- Guide students in practicing the techniques demonstrated, offering feedback and adjustments as needed
- Encourage students to communicate clearly with their partners about pressure, comfort, and boundaries
- Have students switch roles halfway through the session so both can experience giving and receiving

Group Discussion (30 mins):
- Invite students to share their experiences and reflections from the practice session
- Ask prompting questions such as:
  - What did you notice in your own body during giving and receiving acupressure?
  - What challenges or insights arose in locating and releasing trigger points?
  - How might you integrate acupressure and trigger point therapy into your self-care or professional practice?

- Discuss the importance of proper technique, client communication, and scope of practice when using these modalities

Closing (15 mins):
- Guide a final self-acupressure exercise for stress relief and integration
- Review the key points and techniques covered in the lesson
- Provide resources for further study, such as acupressure charts, books, or online courses
- Encourage students to continue practicing and refining their skills through self-care and supervised sessions

Homework:
- Ask students to choose one acupressure point or trigger point location to work with daily for self-care
- Assign reading on case studies or research related to acupressure and trigger point therapy
- Invite students to reflect on their experiences and share any insights or questions at the next class
