Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn vocabulary related to somatic trauma and its impact on the body
- Students will understand the basic principles and benefits of somatic trauma releasing exercises
- Students will practice simple somatic exercises for self-regulation and stress relief
- Students will reflect on their own experiences with stress and the mind-body connection

Warm-up (10 mins):
- Ask students to share any experiences they have with stress or tension in their body
- Discuss how stress and trauma can affect both physical and mental well-being

Vocabulary Introduction (20 mins):
- Present key terms related to somatic trauma and releasing exercises, such as:
  - Trauma, stress, tension, dysregulation
  - Somatic, embodiment, self-regulation, resilience
  - Tremors, shaking, grounding, orienting

- Provide definitions and examples for each word in the context of somatic healing
- Have students practice pronouncing and using the new vocabulary in sentences

Reading and Discussion (30 mins):
- Provide a short reading on the basic principles and benefits of somatic trauma releasing exercises, such as:
  - Trauma and stress can get "stuck" in the body, leading to chronic tension and dysregulation
  - Somatic exercises help release this stored stress through gentle, mindful movement and awareness
  - These exercises can help regulate the nervous system, promote relaxation, and build resilience
  - Examples include tremoring, shaking, grounding, and orienting practices

- Read the passage aloud and check for understanding
- Have students take turns reading sections of the passage
- Discuss the main ideas and answer any questions that arise

Demonstration and Practice (30 mins):
- Guide students through a simple somatic trauma releasing exercise, such as a tremoring or shaking practice
- Provide clear instructions and demonstrations for the exercise
- Emphasize the importance of going slowly, staying within one's comfort zone, and listening to the body's sensations and feedback
- Have students practice the exercise for a few minutes, then pause to check in and share their experiences

Reflection and Discussion (30 mins):
- Ask students to reflect on their experience with the somatic exercise and any sensations or emotions that arose
- Discuss the potential challenges and benefits of incorporating somatic practices into daily life
- Explore how cultural attitudes and beliefs may influence perceptions of stress, trauma, and healing
- Encourage students to share their own self-care strategies and how they relate to the mind-body connection

Wrap-up (10 mins):
- Review the key vocabulary and concepts from the lesson
- Emphasize the importance of self-compassion and patience when working with somatic practices
- Provide resources for further learning about somatic trauma therapy and self-regulation techniques

Homework:
- Ask students to practice the somatic exercise learned in class for at least 5 minutes a day and keep a journal of their observations
- Have them write a short reflection on how stress and trauma manifest in their own bodies and lives, and how somatic practices might support their well-being
- Invite students to share their reflections and experiences at the next class
