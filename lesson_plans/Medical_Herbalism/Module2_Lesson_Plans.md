Vocabulary:
1. Taxonomy: The science of naming, describing, and classifying organisms
   Etymology: From Greek taxis "arrangement" + -nomia "method"
2. Binomial nomenclature: The system of naming species using two terms, the genus name and species epithet
   Etymology: From Latin bi- "two" + nomen "name" + -claturam "calling, naming"
3. Genus (plural: genera): A rank in taxonomy between family and species, containing one or more related species
   Etymology: Latin, meaning "birth, origin, type, group"
4. Species: The basic unit of biological classification, a group of organisms capable of interbreeding
   Etymology: Latin, meaning "kind, sort"
5. Phylogenetic: Relating to or based on evolutionary development and history of organisms
   Etymology: From Greek phylon "race, tribe" + genetikos "origin"
6. Morphological: Relating to the form and structure of organisms
   Etymology: From Greek morphe "form" + -logos "study"
7. Epithet: The second part of a binomial name, identifying the species within a genus
   Etymology: From Greek epitheton "adjective"
8. Cultivar: A plant variety produced by selective breeding
   Etymology: Contraction of "cultivated variety"
9. Variety: A taxonomic rank below species, distinguishing a subgroup with minor differences
   Etymology: From Latin varietas "difference, variety"
10. Nomenclature: The system of names or terms used in a particular field of study
    Etymology: From Latin nomenclatura "calling of names"

## Grammar Points:

1. Use of the present tense for describing scientific concepts:
   - Example: "Taxonomy is the science of naming, describing, and classifying organisms."
   - This structure emphasizes the timeless nature of scientific principles.

2. Parallel structure in lists:
   - Example: "Major ranks in plant taxonomy include Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species."
   - Using parallel structure helps to clearly present hierarchical information.

3. Compound sentences to connect related ideas:
   - Example: "The genus name is capitalized, and the species name is lowercase."
   - This structure allows for the presentation of multiple related rules in a single sentence.

4. Use of passive voice in scientific writing:
   - Example: "Plants are classified based on their morphological and genetic characteristics."
   - Passive voice is often used in scientific contexts to emphasize the action or process rather than the actor.

5. Conditional sentences to explain taxonomic rules:
   - Example: "If a plant belongs to a different genus, it cannot be the same species."
   - This structure is useful for explaining the logical relationships in taxonomic classification.
