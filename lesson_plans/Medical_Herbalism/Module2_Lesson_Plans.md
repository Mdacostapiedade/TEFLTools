Vocabulary:
1. Taxonomy: The science of naming, describing, and classifying organisms
   Etymology: From Greek taxis "arrangement" + -nomia "method"
2. Binomial nomenclature: The system of naming species using two terms, the genus name and species epithet
   Etymology: From Latin bi- "two" + nomen "name" + -claturam "calling, naming"
3. Genus (plural: genera): A rank in taxonomy between family and species, containing one or more related species
   Etymology: Latin, meaning "birth, origin, type, group"
4. Species: The basic unit of biological classification, a group of organisms capable of interbreeding
   Etymology: Latin, meaning "kind, sort"
5. Phylogenetic: Relating to or based on evolutionary development and history of organisms
   Etymology: From Greek phylon "race, tribe" + genetikos "origin"
6. Morphological: Relating to the form and structure of organisms
   Etymology: From Greek morphe "form" + -logos "study"
7. Epithet: The second part of a binomial name, identifying the species within a genus
   Etymology: From Greek epitheton "adjective"
8. Cultivar: A plant variety produced by selective breeding
   Etymology: Contraction of "cultivated variety"
9. Variety: A taxonomic rank below species, distinguishing a subgroup with minor differences
   Etymology: From Latin varietas "difference, variety"
10. Nomenclature: The system of names or terms used in a particular field of study
    Etymology: From Latin nomenclatura "calling of names"
