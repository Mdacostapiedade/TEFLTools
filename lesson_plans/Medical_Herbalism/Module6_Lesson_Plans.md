## Grammar Points:

- Use of colons (:) to introduce lists or explanations, particularly when describing preparation methods, equipment needed, or factors to consider. For example: "Factors influencing preparation choice: herb properties, desired therapeutic effect, patient preferences."

- Proper use of hyphens (-) in compound adjectives related to herbal preparations, such as "weight-to-volume method" or "alcohol-based tincture." This helps clarify the relationship between words and prevents misinterpretation.

- Correct placement of commas (,) in lists of herbs, ingredients, or preparation steps. For instance: "Suitable herbs for teas and infusions include chamomile, peppermint, and lemon balm."

- Appropriate use of parentheses () to provide additional information or examples without disrupting the flow of the sentence. Example: "Suitable herbs for decoctions (e.g., roots, barks, seeds) require longer cooking times."

- Proper capitalization of specific herbal preparation names when used as proper nouns, such as "Folk method" or "Hot process method," to distinguish them from general descriptions.
