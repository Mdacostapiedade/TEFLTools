## 11. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Tuber: The swollen underground stem of the potato plant that we eat as a vegetable
- Cultivar: A plant variety that has been selected for specific desirable characteristics and can be maintained by propagation
- Photoperiod: The duration of daily exposure to light, which affects potato plant growth and tuber formation
- Dormancy: A period of inactivity in potato tubers before they begin to sprout
- Hilling: The practice of mounding soil around potato plants to protect developing tubers and increase yield
