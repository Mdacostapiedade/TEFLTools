## Overview of Potato Production in Timor-Leste

### Current Production Statistics
- Total potato production in Timor-Leste: Approximately 2,500 metric tons annually
- Main production areas: Aileu, Ainaro, and Manufahi districts
- Average yield: 8-10 tons per hectare (significantly lower than global average)

### Economic Importance
- Cash crop for smallholder farmers
- Growing domestic demand due to changing dietary habits
- Potential for import substitution and export to neighboring countries

### Challenges and Opportunities
- Challenges:
  * Limited access to quality seed potatoes
  * Lack of proper storage facilities
  * Pest and disease pressure
  * Climate variability
- Opportunities:
  * Increasing local and regional demand
  * Potential for value-added products (chips, frozen fries)
  * Government support for agricultural diversification

## Potato Varieties Adapted to Tropical Highlands

### Characteristics of Heat-Tolerant Varieties
- Short dormancy period
- Early maturity (90-100 days)
- Tolerance to high day temperatures (up to 35°C)
- Ability to tuberize under short day conditions

### Local and Introduced Cultivars
1. Local varieties:
   - 'Mantega' (yellow flesh, good for boiling)
   - 'Merah' (red skin, suitable for frying)

2. Introduced varieties:
   - 'Granola' (Indonesian variety, widely adapted)
   - 'Atlantic' (good for processing)
   - 'Desiree' (red skin, drought tolerant)

### Comparison of Yield Potential and Disease Resistance
| Variety   | Yield Potential (t/ha) | Late Blight Resistance | Virus Resistance |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Mantega   | 15-20                  | Moderate               | Low               |
| Merah     | 12-15                  | Low                    | Moderate          |
| Granola   | 25-30                  | High                   | Moderate          |
| Atlantic  | 20-25                  | Low                    | High              |
| Desiree   | 18-22                  | Moderate               | Moderate          |

## Basic Potato Growth Requirements

### Soil Type and Preparation
- Well-drained, loose soil with pH 5.5-6.5
- Sandy loam or loamy soils preferred
- Soil preparation:
  * Deep plowing (30-40 cm)
  * Incorporation of organic matter
  * Formation of raised beds or ridges

### Temperature and Altitude Considerations
- Optimal temperature range: 15-20°C (night), 20-25°C (day)
- Altitude: 800-2000 meters above sea level in Timor-Leste
- Higher altitudes compensate for latitude in tropical regions

### Water Requirements
- 500-700 mm of water during the growing season
- Critical periods: 
  * Planting to emergence
  * Tuber initiation
  * Tuber bulking
- Irrigation methods: furrow, sprinkler, or drip

### Nutrient Needs
- Nitrogen (N): 100-150 kg/ha
- Phosphorus (P2O5): 80-120 kg/ha
- Potassium (K2O): 100-150 kg/ha
- Timing of application:
  * Basal dose at planting
  * Top dressing at hilling

# Discussion Questions

1. How does potato production contribute to food security and economic development in Timor-Leste?
2. What are the main challenges faced by potato farmers in Timor-Leste, and how can they be addressed?
3. Compare and contrast the characteristics of local potato varieties with introduced varieties. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
4. How might climate change impact potato production in Timor-Leste, and what adaptation strategies could be implemented?
5. Discuss the importance of proper seed potato selection and storage in improving overall potato production.
6. How can traditional farming practices be integrated with modern techniques to enhance potato cultivation in Timor-Leste?
7. What role can value-added potato products play in developing the agricultural sector in Timor-Leste?
8. Discuss the potential environmental impacts of increased potato production and how they can be mitigated.

# Assignment Details

## Research Assignment: Potato Variety Profile

1. Choose one potato variety not discussed in class that you think might be suitable for cultivation in Timor-Leste.
2. Research the following aspects of your chosen variety:
   - Origin and breeding history
   - Physical characteristics (skin color, flesh color, shape)
   - Growth habits (maturity time, plant size)
   - Yield potential
   - Disease and pest resistance
   - Adaptability to tropical highland conditions
   - Culinary uses and market potential
3. Prepare a 5-minute presentation (with visual aids) on your chosen variety, explaining why you think it would be suitable for Timor-Leste.
