# Support Material for Potato Production Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Tuber**: The swollen underground stem of the potato plant that we eat as a vegetable
- **Cultivar**: A plant variety that has been selected for specific desirable characteristics and can be maintained by propagation
- **Photoperiod**: The duration of daily exposure to light, which affects potato plant growth and tuber formation
- **Dormancy**: A period of inactivity in potato tubers before they begin to sprout
- **Hilling**: The practice of mounding soil around potato plants to protect developing tubers and increase yield
- **Tropical highlands**: Mountainous areas in tropical regions, typically with cooler temperatures suitable for potato cultivation

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barriers**
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of proficiency in the language of instruction.
   - Solution: Use visual aids extensively, provide handouts in multiple languages if possible, and encourage peer translation.

2. **Limited Familiarity with Modern Agricultural Practices**
   - Challenge: Some students may be more familiar with traditional farming methods.
   - Solution: Start with familiar concepts and gradually introduce modern techniques, emphasizing how they complement traditional practices.

3. **Varied Levels of Prior Knowledge**
   - Challenge: Students may have different levels of experience with potato farming.
   - Solution: Use the warm-up activity to assess prior knowledge and adjust the lesson accordingly. Encourage knowledge sharing among students.

4. **Limited Access to Technology**
   - Challenge: Some students may not have experience with PowerPoint presentations or digital resources.
   - Solution: Have printed backups of all digital materials and be prepared to explain concepts without relying on technology.

5. **Misconceptions about Potato Cultivation**
   - Challenge: Students may have incorrect beliefs about potato growing practices.
   - Solution: Address common misconceptions directly, using local examples and evidence-based information to correct them.

6. **Difficulty Relating to Non-Local Varieties**
   - Challenge: Students may be unfamiliar with potato varieties not commonly grown in their area.
   - Solution: Always relate new varieties to local ones, emphasizing similarities and differences in characteristics and cultivation practices.
