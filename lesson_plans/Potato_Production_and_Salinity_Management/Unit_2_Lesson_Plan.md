# Lesson Plan: Understanding Salinity and Its Impact

## 1. Resources Needed

- Soil and water samples from local farms
- EC meters
- Beakers and distilled water
- Projector and slides
- Handouts with salinity threshold charts for potatoes
- Potato plants at different growth stages (or clear photos)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify visual signs of salinity in soil and water
- Explain how salinity affects potato growth at different stages
- Measure and interpret electrical conductivity (EC) of soil and water samples
- Describe the main causes of salinity in Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Display photos of healthy potato plants and salt-stressed potato plants. Ask students to work in pairs to list the differences they observe. Have pairs share their observations with the class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Salinity
- Electrical conductivity (EC)
- Osmotic stress
- Leaching
- Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR)

Use visual aids and simple definitions to ensure understanding.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Causes of Salinity in Timor-Leste
- Discuss natural sources (marine sediments, weathering of rocks)
- Explain human-induced causes (irrigation practices, deforestation)
- Present a map showing salinity-prone areas in Timor-Leste

### Salinity Measurement Units and Thresholds for Potatoes
- Explain EC units (dS/m, mS/cm)
- Present threshold chart for potato salinity tolerance
- Discuss how thresholds vary by growth stage

### Effects of Salinity on Potato Plant Physiology
- Explain osmotic stress and its impact on water uptake
- Discuss specific ion toxicity (Na+ and Cl-)
- Describe nutrient imbalances caused by salinity
- Show images of salinity symptoms at different growth stages

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Activity 1: EC Measurement
Students work in small groups to measure EC of soil and water samples using handheld meters. They record results and classify samples as non-saline, slightly saline, moderately saline, or highly saline.

### Activity 2: Symptom Identification
Provide students with a set of plant samples or detailed photos showing various salinity stress symptoms. Students work in pairs to identify and describe the symptoms, linking them to physiological effects discussed earlier.

## 7. Production Task (20 minutes)

Students create a simple flowchart or concept map showing the causes of salinity, its effects on potato plants, and potential management strategies. They present their work to a neighboring group for peer feedback.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Conduct a quick quiz using true/false and multiple-choice questions to check understanding
- Address any misconceptions or questions that arose during the lesson
- Summarize key points about salinity and its impact on potato production

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will:
1. Collect soil and water samples from their own farms or local areas
2. Measure EC of these samples (if meters are available) or describe visual indicators of salinity
3. Write a short report (1-2 pages) on their findings, including potential implications for potato farming in their area

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Salinity: The concentration of dissolved salts in soil or water
- Electrical conductivity (EC): A measure of the ability of a solution to conduct electricity, used to estimate salinity
- Osmotic stress: Difficulty in water uptake by plants due to high salt concentration in soil solution
- Leaching: The process of washing accumulated salts out of the root zone using excess irrigation or rainfall
- Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR): A measure of the sodium hazard of irrigation water relative to calcium and magnesium concentrations
