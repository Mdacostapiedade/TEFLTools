Here's the support material for the lesson on "Understanding Salinity and Its Impact" formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Salinity Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Salinity**: The concentration of dissolved salts in soil or water
- **Electrical conductivity (EC)**: A measure of the ability of a solution to conduct electricity, used to estimate salinity
- **Osmotic stress**: Difficulty in water uptake by plants due to high salt concentration in soil solution
- **Leaching**: The process of washing accumulated salts out of the root zone using excess irrigation or rainfall
- **Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR)**: A measure of the sodium hazard of irrigation water relative to calcium and magnesium concentrations
- **Threshold**: The level of salinity at which crop yield begins to decline
- **Ion toxicity**: Harmful effects on plant growth caused by excessive uptake of specific ions (e.g., sodium, chloride)
- **Nutrient imbalance**: Disruption in the normal balance of essential nutrients in plants due to salinity stress

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Salinity Effects Diagram**: A simple illustration showing:
   - Healthy potato plant on one side
   - Salt-stressed potato plant on the other side
   - Arrows pointing to specific symptoms (leaf burn, stunted growth, etc.)

2. **Salinity Map of Timor-Leste**: A map of the country highlighting:
   - Areas prone to salinity (coastal regions, specific valleys)
   - Color-coded to show severity (low, moderate, high salinity risk)

3. **EC Measurement Scale**: A visual scale showing:
   - EC values (0-16 dS/m)
   - Corresponding salinity classifications (non-saline, slightly saline, etc.)
   - Potato tolerance thresholds marked at different growth stages

4. **Osmotic Stress Illustration**: A diagram depicting:
   - Plant roots in saline soil
   - Water molecules and salt ions
   - Arrows showing difficulty in water uptake due to osmotic pressure

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Salinity Threshold Chart for Potatoes**:
   - Table format with columns for growth stage, EC threshold, and expected yield reduction
   - Includes values for germination, vegetative growth, tuber initiation, and tuber bulking

2. **EC Measurement Recording Sheet**:
   - Spaces to record sample location, EC reading, and salinity classification
   - Instructions for taking measurements and interpreting results

3. **Salinity Symptom Identification Worksheet**:
   - Images of potato plants showing various salinity stress symptoms
   - Space for students to describe symptoms and link to physiological effects

4. **Salinity Management Flowchart Template**:
   - Blank flowchart with sections for causes, effects, and management strategies
   - Instructions for students to complete based on lesson content

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 61: "Agricultural Drainage Water Management in Arid and Semi-Arid Areas"
2. International Potato Center (CIP) guide: "Potato Production in Saline Conditions"
3. Online EC to TDS conversion calculator
4. Video tutorial: "How to Use a Handheld EC Meter"
5. Local extension service fact sheets on salinity management in Timor-Leste (in Tetum and Portuguese)

## 5. Tips for Teachers

1. **Language Barrier**: Be prepared with visual aids and simple explanations in local languages. Consider having a translator if needed.

2. **Varying Literacy Levels**: Use hands-on activities and demonstrations to reinforce concepts for all learners.

3. **Limited Resources**: If EC meters are scarce, demonstrate usage and then have students rotate through stations to practice.

4. **Contextualizing Content**: Relate salinity issues to local experiences and traditional knowledge where possible.

5. **Practical Application**: Emphasize how the information can be directly applied to improve farming practices.

6. **Misconceptions**: Be prepared to address common local beliefs about salinity that may not be scientifically accurate.

7. **Engagement**: Use local case studies and invite experienced farmers to share their salinity management strategies.

8. **Follow-up**: Plan for ways to provide ongoing support as farmers implement new practices (e.g., WhatsApp group, follow-up visits).
