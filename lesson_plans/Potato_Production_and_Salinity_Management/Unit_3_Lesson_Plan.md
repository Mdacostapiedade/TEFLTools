# Lesson Plan: Soil and Water Testing for Salinity

## 1. Resources Needed

- Soil sampling tools (augers, trowels, buckets)
- Clean plastic bags for soil samples
- Water sampling bottles
- Portable EC meter
- Distilled water
- Soil and water testing kits
- Sample laboratory reports
- Handouts with soil and water testing guidelines
- Projector and computer for presentations

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Demonstrate proper soil and water sampling techniques for salinity assessment
- Explain the importance of representative sampling
- Interpret basic soil and water test results for salinity
- Identify key parameters in laboratory reports related to salinity

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show pictures of healthy potato plants and salt-affected potato plants
- Ask students to discuss in pairs what they observe and potential causes
- Share observations with the class, introducing the concept of salinity testing

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Electrical Conductivity (EC)
- Soil saturation extract
- Parts per million (ppm)
- Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)
- Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Soil Sampling Methods
- Explain the importance of representative sampling
- Demonstrate the zigzag pattern for field sampling
- Show proper sampling depth for potatoes (0-30cm and 30-60cm)
- Discuss sample size and mixing techniques

### Water Sampling Techniques
- Explain proper methods for sampling irrigation water
- Demonstrate how to collect a representative water sample
- Discuss timing of water sampling (seasonal variations)

### Understanding Laboratory Reports
- Review key parameters in soil and water test reports
- Explain how to interpret EC, pH, and SAR values
- Discuss threshold levels for potato production

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### Activity 1: Soil Sampling Simulation
- Divide class into groups
- Provide each group with a "field map" and sampling tools
- Have groups practice the zigzag sampling pattern and proper techniques

### Activity 2: Interpreting Test Results
- Provide sample laboratory reports to each group
- Have students identify key salinity parameters and interpret the results
- Discuss findings as a class

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

### Task 1: Develop a Sampling Plan
- Students create a sampling plan for a hypothetical potato field
- Include number of samples, sampling pattern, and depths

### Task 2: EC Measurement Practice
- Demonstrate use of portable EC meter
- Students practice measuring EC in water and soil samples

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points of soil and water sampling for salinity
- Review interpretation of test results
- Address any remaining questions from students

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a one-page summary on how different soil textures affect salinity measurements
- Practice interpreting three additional soil test reports (provided)

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Electrical Conductivity (EC): A measure of the ability of a solution to conduct electricity, used to estimate salinity levels
- Soil saturation extract: A soil testing method where water is added to soil until saturated, then the liquid is extracted for analysis
- Parts per million (ppm): A unit of measurement for very dilute concentrations of substances
- Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC): The total capacity of a soil to hold exchangeable cations
- Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR): A measure of the sodicity of soil, calculated from the concentrations of sodium, calcium, and magnesium
