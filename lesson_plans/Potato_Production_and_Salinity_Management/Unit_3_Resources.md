## Soil Sampling Methods for Salinity Assessment

### Importance of Representative Sampling
- Salinity can vary greatly across a field
- Proper sampling ensures accurate assessment of overall salinity levels
- Helps in making informed management decisions

### Zigzag Pattern for Field Sampling
- Walk in a zigzag pattern across the field
- Take samples at regular intervals
- Ensures coverage of different areas within the field

### Proper Sampling Depth for Potatoes
- 0-30 cm: Primary root zone, critical for initial growth
- 30-60 cm: Secondary root zone, important for later growth stages
- Take separate samples from each depth range

### Sample Size and Mixing Techniques
- Collect at least 15-20 subsamples per field
- Mix subsamples thoroughly in a clean bucket
- Take a composite sample of about 500g for analysis

## Water Quality Testing for Irrigation

### Methods for Sampling Irrigation Water
- Sample directly from the irrigation source (well, river, etc.)
- For drip systems, sample from emitters at different locations
- Collect samples in clean, rinsed plastic bottles

### Collecting a Representative Water Sample
- Let water run for a few minutes before sampling
- Rinse the bottle with the water to be sampled
- Fill the bottle completely, leaving no air space

### Timing of Water Sampling
- Sample at the beginning, middle, and end of the growing season
- Account for seasonal variations in water quality
- More frequent sampling if water quality is variable

## Understanding Laboratory Reports

### Key Parameters in Soil and Water Test Reports
- Electrical Conductivity (EC)
- pH
- Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR)
- Major cations: Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium
- Major anions: Chloride, Sulfate, Bicarbonate

### Interpreting EC, pH, and SAR Values
- EC: Measure of total dissolved salts
  * < 2 dS/m: Generally safe for potatoes
  * 2-4 dS/m: Moderate salinity, yield reduction possible
  * > 4 dS/m: Severe salinity, significant yield reduction
- pH: Optimal range for potatoes is 5.5-6.5
- SAR: Indicates potential for sodium-related soil structure problems
  * < 6: Low risk
  * 6-9: Medium risk
  * > 9: High risk

### Threshold Levels for Potato Production
- EC threshold: 1.7 dS/m (saturated soil extract)
- Yield decrease: 12% per dS/m increase above threshold
- Critical SAR level: 12 (may vary with soil texture)

# Discussion Questions

1. Why is representative sampling important when assessing soil salinity? How might improper sampling lead to incorrect management decisions?

2. How does the sampling depth affect our understanding of salinity in potato fields? Why do we sample at different depths?

3. What are the potential consequences of irrigating potatoes with water that has a high EC value? How might this impact plant growth and yield?

4. How can seasonal variations in water quality affect potato production? Why is it important to sample water at different times during the growing season?

5. Discuss the relationship between EC, SAR, and soil structure. How do these parameters interact to affect potato growth?

6. What strategies could a farmer employ if soil test results show moderate salinity levels (EC 2-4 dS/m) in a potato field?

7. How might different soil textures (sandy vs. clay) influence the interpretation of salinity test results?

8. Discuss the importance of pH in relation to nutrient availability and potato growth. How does salinity affect soil pH?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Developing a Salinity Management Plan for a Potato Farm in Timor-Leste"

Your essay should include:
- An introduction explaining the importance of salinity management in potato production
- A description of the key steps in developing a salinity management plan
- Discussion of specific soil and water testing procedures relevant to Timor-Leste
- Explanation of how test results would be interpreted and used to inform management decisions
- Conclusion summarizing the main points and emphasizing the importance of ongoing monitoring

Use the lecture notes and your own research to support your essay. Include at least three specific management strategies that could be implemented based on soil and water test results.

# Assignment Details

## Soil Sampling Plan Development

1. You have been given a map of a 5-hectare potato field in Timor-Leste. The field has a slight slope from north to south and is irrigated using a center pivot system.

2. Develop a comprehensive soil sampling plan for assessing salinity in this field. Your plan should include:
   - A diagram showing the sampling pattern and locations
   - The number of samples to be collected
   - Sampling depths and rationale for chosen depths
   - A list of equipment needed for sampling
   - A step-by-step procedure for collecting and handling samples
   - Recommendations for sample storage and transportation to the laboratory

3. Explain how you would modify your sampling plan if:
   - The field had been divided into different management zones based on yield data
   - There was a known salinity problem in one corner of the field
   - The field had recently been converted from rice production to potatoes

4. Provide a brief explanation (200-300 words) of how this sampling plan will ensure accurate representation of the field's salinity status and how the results will inform management decisions.

Submit your sampling plan, diagram, and explanation as a single document.

# Additional Materials

## EC Measurement Procedure Using a Portable EC Meter

1. Calibrate the EC meter using standard solutions according to manufacturer instructions.

2. For soil EC measurement:
   - Mix 1 part soil with 2 parts distilled water in a clean container
   - Stir the mixture thoroughly and let it settle for 30 minutes
   - Insert the EC probe into the clear liquid above the settled soil
   - Record the EC reading once it stabilizes

3. For water EC measurement:
   - Rinse the EC probe with distilled water
   - Insert the probe directly into the water sample
   - Gently stir and wait for the reading to stabilize
   - Record the EC value

4. Clean the probe with distilled water between measurements.

5. Convert EC readings to appropriate units if necessary (e.g., dS/m to mmhos/cm).

## Example Soil Test Report Interpretation

Soil Test Results:
- EC (saturated paste extract): 3.2 dS/m
- pH: 7.8
- SAR: 8
- Texture: Sandy loam

Interpretation:
- EC indicates moderate salinity; expect some yield reduction in potatoes
- pH is slightly high for optimal potato growth; may affect nutrient availability
- SAR is in the medium risk range; monitor for soil structure issues
- Sandy loam texture may allow for easier leaching of salts

Management Recommendations:
1. Implement leaching irrigation to flush salts from the root zone
2. Consider adding organic matter to improve soil structure and water-holding capacity
3. Monitor irrigation water quality closely
4. Select salt-tolerant potato varieties if available
5. Apply acidifying fertilizers to help lower soil pH over time
