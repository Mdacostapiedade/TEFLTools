# Lesson Plan: Irrigation Management in Saline Conditions

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts with irrigation scheduling examples
- Soil moisture sensors (for demonstration)
- EC meters (for demonstration)
- Drip irrigation system components (for demonstration)
- Calculators
- Graph paper

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the principles of irrigation scheduling for potatoes in saline conditions
- Calculate leaching requirements for salt management
- Describe the benefits of drip irrigation for salinity control
- Design a basic irrigation plan for a potato field with saline soil and water

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Divide the class into small groups. Ask each group to brainstorm and list potential problems that might occur when irrigating potatoes with saline water. Have groups share their ideas with the class and discuss.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Leaching fraction
- Evapotranspiration (ET)
- Soil moisture tension
- Emitter
- Soil water holding capacity

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### a. Irrigation Scheduling for Potatoes
- Discuss the importance of proper timing and amount of irrigation
- Explain methods for determining crop water requirements (ET-based, soil moisture-based)
- Present guidelines for potato irrigation at different growth stages

### b. Leaching Techniques for Salt Management
- Explain the concept of leaching fraction
- Demonstrate how to calculate leaching requirements
- Discuss the timing of leaching irrigations

### c. Drip Irrigation Systems for Salt Management
- Outline the benefits of drip irrigation in saline conditions
- Describe key components of a drip system
- Explain how drip irrigation helps manage salinity in the root zone

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### a. Irrigation Scheduling Exercise
Provide students with weather data, crop coefficients, and soil information. Have them calculate irrigation requirements for a potato crop at different growth stages.

### b. Leaching Requirement Calculation
Give students scenarios with different irrigation water EC values and soil salinity thresholds. Have them calculate the required leaching fractions.

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

Divide the class into small groups. Assign each group a hypothetical potato field scenario with specific soil type, climate data, water quality, and field size. Have students design an irrigation plan that includes:
- Irrigation scheduling
- Leaching strategy
- Drip system layout (if applicable)

Groups will present their plans to the class for discussion and feedback.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Summarize key points of the lesson
- Address any remaining questions from students
- Conduct a quick quiz on main concepts (e.g., multiple choice questions on irrigation scheduling, leaching, and drip irrigation)

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will research and write a short report (1-2 pages) on a case study of successful irrigation management in saline conditions, either from Timor-Leste or a similar tropical region. They should focus on the specific strategies used and the outcomes achieved.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Leaching fraction: The portion of applied irrigation water that drains below the root zone, carrying salts with it.
- Evapotranspiration (ET): The combined process of water evaporation from soil and plant surfaces and transpiration through plant tissues.
- Soil moisture tension: The force with which water is held in the soil, measured in centibars or kPa.
- Emitter: A device in a drip irrigation system that delivers water to the soil at a controlled rate.
- Soil water holding capacity: The amount of water that a soil can hold against the force of gravity.
