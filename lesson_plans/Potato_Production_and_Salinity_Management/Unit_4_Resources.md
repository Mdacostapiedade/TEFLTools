# Lecture Notes

## Irrigation Scheduling for Potatoes

### Introduction
- Importance of proper irrigation timing and amount for potatoes in saline conditions
- Challenges of balancing water needs with salt management

### Methods for Determining Crop Water Requirements
1. ET-based scheduling
   - Using weather data and crop coefficients
   - Calculating daily ET rates
   - Adjusting for crop growth stage

2. Soil moisture-based scheduling
   - Using soil moisture sensors
   - Interpreting soil moisture tension readings
   - Setting irrigation triggers based on soil water depletion

### Guidelines for Potato Irrigation at Different Growth Stages
1. Vegetative stage
   - Maintain soil moisture at 65-75% of field capacity
   - Frequent, light irrigations to promote root development

2. Tuber initiation
   - Increase soil moisture to 80-90% of field capacity
   - Avoid water stress to maximize tuber set

3. Tuber bulking
   - Maintain consistent soil moisture at 70-80% of field capacity
   - Regular irrigations to support rapid tuber growth

4. Maturation
   - Gradually reduce irrigation frequency
   - Allow soil to dry slightly to promote skin set

### Adjusting Irrigation for Saline Conditions
- Increasing irrigation frequency
- Applying excess water for leaching
- Monitoring soil salinity levels

## Leaching Techniques for Salt Management

### Concept of Leaching Fraction
- Definition: Portion of applied water that drains below the root zone
- Purpose: Remove accumulated salts from the root zone

### Calculating Leaching Requirements
1. Leaching Requirement (LR) formula:
   LR = ECw / (5 * ECe - ECw)
   Where:
   ECw = Electrical conductivity of irrigation water
   ECe = Electrical conductivity threshold for crop yield decline

2. Example calculation:
   If ECw = 2 dS/m and ECe for potatoes = 1.7 dS/m
   LR = 2 / (5 * 1.7 - 2) = 0.31 or 31%

### Timing of Leaching Irrigations
- Pre-planting leaching
- In-season leaching
- Post-harvest leaching

### Leaching Strategies
- Continuous leaching vs. intermittent leaching
- Adjusting irrigation system for leaching events
- Monitoring drainage water quality

## Drip Irrigation Systems for Salt Management

### Benefits of Drip Irrigation in Saline Conditions
- Precise water application
- Maintains consistent soil moisture
- Reduces salt accumulation in root zone
- Improves fertilizer efficiency

### Key Components of a Drip System
1. Water source and pumping system
2. Filtration system
3. Pressure regulators
4. Main and sub-main lines
5. Laterals and emitters
6. Control valves and automation equipment

### Managing Salinity with Drip Irrigation
- Frequent, low-volume irrigations
- Pushing salts to periphery of wetted area
- Combining drip with periodic sprinkler irrigation for leaching

### Design Considerations for Saline Conditions
- Emitter selection for clog resistance
- System flushing capabilities
- Chemigation options for amendments

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the irrigation strategy for potatoes grown in saline conditions differ from those grown in non-saline soils?

2. What are the potential risks of over-irrigating in saline conditions, and how can these risks be mitigated?

3. Discuss the pros and cons of using soil moisture sensors versus ET-based scheduling for irrigation management in Timor-Leste.

4. How might climate change impact irrigation management strategies for potato production in Timor-Leste?

5. What cultural or economic factors in Timor-Leste might influence the adoption of drip irrigation systems for potato production?

6. How can traditional Timorese irrigation practices be integrated with modern salinity management techniques?

7. Discuss the potential environmental impacts of leaching practices and how these can be minimized.

8. How might the irrigation management strategies discussed in this lesson be adapted for other crops commonly grown in Timor-Leste?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay comparing and contrasting drip irrigation and surface irrigation methods for potato production in saline conditions. Consider the following points:

- Water use efficiency
- Salt management effectiveness
- Initial costs and maintenance requirements
- Suitability for different field sizes and terrain
- Potential for integration with local farming practices in Timor-Leste

Your essay should include an introduction, body paragraphs addressing each point, and a conclusion summarizing your findings and recommendations.

# Assignment Details

## Irrigation Plan Design

Design an irrigation plan for a 1-hectare potato field in Timor-Leste with the following conditions:

- Soil type: Sandy loam
- Average daily ET during growing season: 5 mm
- Irrigation water EC: 1.8 dS/m
- Potato variety salt tolerance threshold (ECe): 1.7 dS/m
- Field dimensions: 100m x 100m
- Available water sources: Groundwater well, seasonal stream

Your irrigation plan should include:

1. Choice of irrigation method (justify your selection)
2. Irrigation scheduling strategy
3. Leaching requirement calculations and strategy
4. System layout (if using drip irrigation)
5. Water source management plan
6. Monitoring and adjustment protocols

Submit a 3-4 page report detailing your plan, including any necessary calculations, diagrams, and justifications for your decisions.
