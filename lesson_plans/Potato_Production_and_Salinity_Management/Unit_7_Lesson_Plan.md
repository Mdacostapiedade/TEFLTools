# Lesson Plan: Monitoring and Management Strategies for Potato Production in Saline Conditions

## 1. Resources Needed

- Handheld EC meters (1 per 3-4 students)
- Soil moisture sensors (1 per 3-4 students)
- Plant tissue sampling kits
- Sample record-keeping sheets and logbooks
- Laptop and projector for presentations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on monitoring techniques and threshold values

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Use handheld EC meters and other monitoring tools correctly
- Interpret EC readings and other monitoring data
- Develop a comprehensive season-long monitoring plan for a potato crop
- Understand the importance of record-keeping in salinity management

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Group discussion: Ask students to share their experiences with crop monitoring. What methods have they used? What challenges have they faced? How have they used monitoring data to make decisions?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Electrical Conductivity (EC)
- Soil moisture tension
- Leaf tissue analysis
- Threshold values
- Adaptive management

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### a. In-season soil and plant monitoring methods
- Soil EC monitoring: frequency, sampling locations, interpretation
- Soil moisture monitoring: types of sensors, placement, reading interpretation
- Plant tissue sampling: timing, collection methods, what to look for in results
- Visual plant health assessments: key indicators of salt stress

### b. Adjusting management based on monitoring results
- EC thresholds for potato at different growth stages
- Irrigation adjustments based on soil EC and moisture readings
- Fertilizer modifications in response to tissue analysis
- Importance of timely interventions

### c. Record-keeping for long-term improvement
- Types of data to record: EC readings, irrigation amounts, fertilizer applications, yields
- Methods of record-keeping: paper logbooks vs. digital systems
- Analyzing trends over multiple seasons
- Using historical data to inform future management decisions

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

### a. EC meter practice (20 minutes)
In small groups, students practice using handheld EC meters on soil samples with varying salinity levels. They record readings and discuss interpretation.

### b. Monitoring data interpretation exercise (25 minutes)
Provide students with a set of sample monitoring data (EC readings, soil moisture, tissue analysis) from a hypothetical potato field. In pairs, they analyze the data and propose management adjustments.

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

In groups of 3-4, students develop a season-long monitoring plan for a potato crop in saline conditions. The plan should include:
- Monitoring schedule (what to measure and when)
- Sampling locations within the field
- Threshold values for different parameters
- Proposed management responses to different scenarios

Groups present their plans to the class for feedback.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Address any remaining questions
- Emphasize the importance of consistent monitoring and adaptive management

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will:
1. Research and write a one-page summary of a new monitoring technology or method that could be useful for managing potato production in saline conditions.
2. Begin a practice logbook, recording daily weather conditions and any observations of their home garden or a nearby crop for one week.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Electrical Conductivity (EC): A measure of the ability of a solution to conduct electricity, used as an indicator of salinity levels.
- Soil moisture tension: The force with which water is held in the soil, indicating how hard plants must work to extract water.
- Leaf tissue analysis: Laboratory testing of plant leaves to determine nutrient content and potential deficiencies or toxicities.
- Threshold values: Specific levels of a measured parameter (e.g., EC) at which management actions should be taken.
- Adaptive management: A flexible approach to crop management that involves continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment of practices based on observed results.
