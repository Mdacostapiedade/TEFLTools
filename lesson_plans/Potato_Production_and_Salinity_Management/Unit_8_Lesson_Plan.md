# Lesson Plan: Harvesting and Post-Harvest Handling of Potatoes in Saline Conditions

## 1. Resources Needed

- Mature potato plants (both salt-stressed and normal)
- Harvesting tools (shovels, buckets, baskets)
- Potato samples in various stages of maturity
- EC meter
- Storage crates or bags
- Thermometer and hygrometer
- Projector and screen for presentations
- Handouts on potato maturity indicators and storage guidelines

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Determine the optimal harvest time for potatoes grown in saline conditions
- Demonstrate proper harvesting techniques to minimize damage
- Explain the key considerations for storing potatoes affected by salt stress
- Design a basic storage plan for potatoes harvested from saline soils

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display various potato samples (some from saline conditions, some from normal conditions)
- Ask students to observe and discuss in pairs the differences they notice
- Have pairs share their observations with the class, focusing on how salinity might affect harvest timing and quality

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Skin set
- Specific gravity
- Bruising
- Curing
- Respiration rate
- Dormancy

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### A. Determining Potato Maturity in Saline Conditions
- Discuss how salinity affects potato maturity indicators
- Explain methods to test for maturity:
  * Skin set test
  * Specific gravity measurement
  * Dry matter content

### B. Harvesting Methods to Minimize Damage
- Demonstrate proper digging techniques
- Explain the importance of careful handling to prevent bruising
- Discuss how salt stress may affect potato skin and susceptibility to damage

### C. Storage Considerations for Salt-Stressed Potatoes
- Explain the impact of salinity on potato storage life
- Discuss optimal temperature and humidity conditions
- Address the importance of proper ventilation
- Explain the curing process and its significance for salt-stressed potatoes

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### A. Maturity Assessment Exercise (20 minutes)
- Divide students into groups
- Provide each group with potato plants grown in different salinity levels
- Have students perform maturity tests and decide if the potatoes are ready for harvest

### B. Harvesting Technique Practice (20 minutes)
- Demonstrate proper harvesting techniques
- Allow students to practice harvesting potatoes, emphasizing gentle handling
- Discuss any differences noticed between salt-stressed and normal potatoes

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

### Storage Facility Design Exercise
- Divide students into small groups
- Task each group with designing a small-scale storage facility for potatoes harvested from saline soils
- Groups should consider temperature control, humidity management, and ventilation
- Have groups present their designs to the class, explaining their choices

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the key points of the lesson
- Conduct a quick quiz on the main concepts covered
- Address any remaining questions from students

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a one-page report on traditional potato storage methods used in Timor-Leste
- Explain how these methods might be adapted or improved for storing potatoes grown in saline conditions

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Skin set: The process by which potato skin toughens, making it less susceptible to damage during harvest
- Specific gravity: A measure of potato density, used to estimate dry matter content
- Bruising: Physical damage to potatoes that can occur during harvest and handling
- Curing: The process of healing potato wounds and toughening skin after harvest
- Respiration rate: The rate at which potatoes use oxygen and release carbon dioxide, affecting storage life
- Dormancy: The natural resting state of potatoes after harvest, before sprouting begins
