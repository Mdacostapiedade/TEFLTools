## Determining Potato Maturity in Saline Conditions

### Impact of Salinity on Maturity Indicators
- Salinity can delay maturity and affect traditional indicators
- Leaf senescence may occur earlier due to salt stress
- Skin set may be slower or incomplete in saline conditions

### Methods to Test for Maturity

#### Skin Set Test
- Gently rub thumb against potato skin
- Mature potatoes: skin doesn't peel off easily
- Immature potatoes: skin slips off

#### Specific Gravity Measurement
1. Weigh potato in air
2. Weigh potato suspended in water
3. Calculate specific gravity: 
   Weight in air / (Weight in air - Weight in water)
- Higher specific gravity indicates higher dry matter content
- Salinity may lower specific gravity

#### Dry Matter Content
- Cut and weigh a sample of potato
- Dry in oven at 105°C for 24 hours
- Weigh dried sample
- Calculate dry matter %: (Dry weight / Fresh weight) x 100
- Aim for 20-25% dry matter content

## Harvesting Methods to Minimize Damage

### Proper Digging Techniques
- Wait for vines to die back naturally or kill them 2-3 weeks before harvest
- Avoid harvesting in wet conditions
- Use diggers or forks to loosen soil around plants
- Lift plants gently, avoiding direct contact with tubers

### Careful Handling
- Allow potatoes to dry on surface for 1-2 hours if conditions permit
- Handle gently when picking up and placing in containers
- Avoid dropping potatoes or allowing them to roll
- Use padded containers to reduce bruising

### Impact of Salt Stress on Potato Skin
- Salt-stressed potatoes may have thinner, more delicate skin
- Increased susceptibility to skinning and bruising
- Extra care needed during harvest and handling

## Storage Considerations for Salt-Stressed Potatoes

### Impact of Salinity on Storage Life
- Potentially shorter dormancy period
- Higher respiration rates
- Increased susceptibility to storage diseases

### Optimal Storage Conditions
- Temperature: 7-10°C (45-50°F)
- Relative Humidity: 90-95%
- Darkness to prevent greening

### Ventilation
- Crucial for removing heat and moisture
- Helps prevent condensation on potato surfaces
- Aim for air exchange of 10-20 times the storage volume per hour

### Curing Process
- Hold at 10-13°C (50-55°F) and 90-95% RH for 10-14 days
- Allows for wound healing and skin set
- May need extended curing time for salt-stressed potatoes

# Discussion Questions

1. How might salinity affect the traditional indicators of potato maturity? What challenges does this present for farmers?

2. Compare and contrast the harvesting methods for potatoes grown in normal conditions versus those grown in saline conditions. What extra precautions might be necessary?

3. Discuss the potential long-term effects of salt stress on potato storability. How might farmers need to adjust their storage practices?

4. How could traditional storage methods in Timor-Leste be adapted to better suit potatoes grown in saline conditions?

5. What role does proper ventilation play in potato storage, and why might it be especially important for salt-stressed potatoes?

6. Discuss the economic implications of potentially shorter storage life for salt-stressed potatoes. How might this affect marketing and distribution strategies?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Adapting Potato Harvest and Storage Practices for Saline Conditions in Timor-Leste"

Your essay should address the following points:
- The unique challenges of harvesting potatoes grown in saline conditions
- Modifications to traditional harvesting techniques to minimize damage
- Key considerations for storing salt-stressed potatoes
- Potential adaptations of local storage methods to improve outcomes
- The importance of educating farmers on these specialized practices

Use specific examples and information from the lecture notes to support your arguments. Consider the local context of Timor-Leste in your discussion.
