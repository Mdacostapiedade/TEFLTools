Here's the support material for the lesson on "Harvesting and Post-Harvest Handling of Potatoes in Saline Conditions," formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Skin set**: The process by which potato skin toughens, making it less susceptible to damage during harvest
- **Specific gravity**: A measure of potato density, used to estimate dry matter content
- **Bruising**: Physical damage to potatoes that can occur during harvest and handling
- **Curing**: The process of healing potato wounds and toughening skin after harvest
- **Respiration rate**: The rate at which potatoes use oxygen and release carbon dioxide, affecting storage life
- **Dormancy**: The natural resting state of potatoes after harvest, before sprouting begins
- **Electrical conductivity (EC)**: A measure of the soil's ability to conduct electricity, used to estimate salt content
- **Salinity stress**: The negative effects on plant growth and development caused by high salt concentrations in soil or water
- **Dry matter content**: The portion of the potato that is not water, typically higher in potatoes grown under saline conditions

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have difficulty distinguishing between normal and salt-stressed potatoes.
   - **Solution**: Provide a diverse range of samples and create a comparative chart highlighting key differences.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to advanced testing equipment (e.g., specific gravity meters).
   - **Solution**: Teach alternative, low-tech methods such as the salt solution float test for estimating dry matter content.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with the concept of curing potatoes.
   - **Solution**: Set up a small-scale curing demonstration in the classroom to show the process over several days.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in simulating proper storage conditions in a classroom setting.
   - **Solution**: Use virtual simulations or create a miniature model of a storage facility to demonstrate principles.

5. **Challenge**: Students may not fully grasp the long-term effects of salinity on potato storage life.
   - **Solution**: Incorporate case studies or invite guest speakers with practical experience in managing salt-stressed potato crops.

6. **Challenge**: Adapting traditional storage methods to accommodate salt-stressed potatoes.
   - **Solution**: Encourage students to interview local farmers and conduct research on traditional methods, then facilitate a discussion on potential adaptations.
