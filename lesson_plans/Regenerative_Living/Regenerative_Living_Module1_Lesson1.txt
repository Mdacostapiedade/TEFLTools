# Lesson Plan: Foundations of Permaculture - Ethics and Principles

## Objective:
By the end of the lesson, learners will be able to:
- Define permaculture and its core ethics
- Identify and explain the 12 principles of permaculture design
- Apply the ethics and principles to real-life scenarios

## Duration: 90 minutes

## Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with permaculture ethics and principles (see resources)
- Case study scenarios for group activity

## Lesson Outline:

1. Introduction (10 minutes)
   - Greet the learners and introduce the topic of permaculture
   - Write "Permaculture" on the board and ask learners to share their understanding of the term
   - Provide a clear definition of permaculture and its origins

2. Permaculture Ethics (20 minutes)
   - Introduce the three core ethics of permaculture: Earth Care, People Care, and Fair Share
   - Divide learners into three groups and assign each group one ethic
   - Groups discuss and prepare a short presentation on their assigned ethic
   - Each group presents their ethic to the class

3. Permaculture Principles (30 minutes)
   - Distribute handouts with the 12 principles of permaculture design - see Readings folder
   - Briefly explain each principle, providing examples and encouraging learner participation
   - Divide learners into pairs and assign each pair 2-3 principles
   - Pairs discuss their assigned principles and create mind maps or posters to illustrate them
   - Pairs present their mind maps or posters to the class

4. Application Activity (20 minutes)
   - Present learners with real-life scenarios related to permaculture (e.g., designing a garden, managing waste)
   - In small groups, learners discuss how to apply the permaculture ethics and principles to address the scenarios
   - Groups share their ideas with the class

5. Conclusion (10 minutes)
   - Review the main points of the lesson: permaculture definition, ethics, and principles
   - Encourage learners to reflect on how they can apply permaculture in their own lives
   - Address any remaining questions and provide resources for further learning

## Assessment:
- Observe learner participation and understanding during group activities and discussions
- Review mind maps, posters, and scenario solutions created by learners
- Administer a short quiz or written reflection at the end of the lesson to assess comprehension

Here's a Grammar Points section for the lesson plan on Foundations of Permaculture:

## Grammar Points:

1. Imperative sentences: Use imperative sentences to express the principles of permaculture concisely. For example, "Observe and interact" or "Use and value renewable resources and services."

2. Conditional sentences: Employ conditional sentences to discuss potential applications of permaculture principles. For instance, "If we apply the principle of 'Produce no waste,' we could significantly reduce our environmental impact."

3. Present simple for facts and general truths: Utilize the present simple tense to state the core ethics and principles of permaculture. For example, "Permaculture ethics consist of Earth Care, People Care, and Fair Share."

4. Gerunds and infinitives: Use gerunds and infinitives to describe permaculture activities and goals. For instance, "Designing sustainable systems involves applying multiple principles" or "The aim is to create productive ecosystems."

5. Compound and complex sentences: Construct compound and complex sentences to explain the relationships between different permaculture concepts. For example, "While Earth Care focuses on the environment, People Care emphasizes the importance of human well-being, and together they form a holistic approach to sustainability."
