# Lesson Plan: Foundations of Permaculture - Ethics and Principles

## Objective:
By the end of the lesson, learners will be able to:
- Define permaculture and its core ethics
- Identify and explain the 12 principles of permaculture design
- Apply the ethics and principles to real-life scenarios

## Duration: 90 minutes

## Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with permaculture ethics and principles (see resources)
- Case study scenarios for group activity

## Lesson Outline:

1. Introduction (10 minutes)
   - Greet the learners and introduce the topic of permaculture
   - Write "Permaculture" on the board and ask learners to share their understanding of the term
   - Provide a clear definition of permaculture and its origins

2. Permaculture Ethics (20 minutes)
   - Introduce the three core ethics of permaculture: Earth Care, People Care, and Fair Share
   - Divide learners into three groups and assign each group one ethic
   - Groups discuss and prepare a short presentation on their assigned ethic
   - Each group presents their ethic to the class

3. Permaculture Principles (30 minutes)
   - Distribute handouts with the 12 principles of permaculture design - see Readings folder
   - Briefly explain each principle, providing examples and encouraging learner participation
   - Divide learners into pairs and assign each pair 2-3 principles
   - Pairs discuss their assigned principles and create mind maps or posters to illustrate them
   - Pairs present their mind maps or posters to the class

4. Application Activity (20 minutes)
   - Present learners with real-life scenarios related to permaculture (e.g., designing a garden, managing waste)
   - In small groups, learners discuss how to apply the permaculture ethics and principles to address the scenarios
   - Groups share their ideas with the class

5. Conclusion (10 minutes)
   - Review the main points of the lesson: permaculture definition, ethics, and principles
   - Encourage learners to reflect on how they can apply permaculture in their own lives
   - Address any remaining questions and provide resources for further learning

## Assessment:
- Observe learner participation and understanding during group activities and discussions
- Review mind maps, posters, and scenario solutions created by learners
- Administer a short quiz or written reflection at the end of the lesson to assess comprehension
