# Lesson Plan: Patterns in Nature and Application to Design

## Objective:
By the end of the lesson, learners will be able to:
- Identify common patterns found in nature
- Understand how these patterns can be applied to permaculture design
- Create a simple design using natural patterns

## Duration: 90 minutes

## Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Images of natural patterns (see resources)
- Drawing paper and pencils for each learner
- Handout on natural patterns and their applications (see resources)

## Lesson Outline:

1. Introduction (10 minutes)
   - Greet the learners and introduce the topic of patterns in nature
   - Ask learners to share examples of patterns they have observed in nature
   - Explain the significance of patterns in permaculture design

2. Common Natural Patterns (30 minutes)
   - Present images of common natural patterns (e.g., spirals, branches, waves, tessellations)
   - Discuss the characteristics and examples of each pattern
   - Divide learners into small groups and assign each group a pattern
   - Groups discuss their assigned pattern and its potential applications in design
   - Each group presents their findings to the class

3. Applying Patterns to Design (20 minutes)
   - Distribute the handout on natural patterns and their applications
   - Explain how natural patterns can inform permaculture design (e.g., efficient use of space, flow of energy)
   - Provide examples of permaculture designs that incorporate natural patterns
   - Encourage learners to ask questions and share their thoughts

4. Design Activity (20 minutes)
   - Provide each learner with drawing paper and pencils
   - Ask learners to create a simple permaculture design (e.g., garden layout, water catchment system) incorporating at least one natural pattern
   - Encourage learners to consider the principles of permaculture and the specific needs of their design
   - Learners share their designs with a partner and provide feedback

5. Conclusion (10 minutes)
   - Review the main points of the lesson: common natural patterns and their applications in permaculture design
   - Encourage learners to continue observing patterns in nature and considering how they can be applied to design
   - Address any remaining questions and provide resources for further learning

## Assessment:
- Observe learner participation and understanding during group activities and discussions
- Review designs created by learners and provide constructive feedback
- Administer a short quiz or written reflection at the end of the lesson to assess comprehension

Here's a Grammar Points section for the lesson plan, formatted as a Markdown list with emphasis on Reported Speech:

## Grammar Points:

- **Reported Speech**: Use reported speech when discussing observations or findings from group activities. For example, "The spiral group reported that they found examples of this pattern in seashells and plant growth."

- **Conditional Sentences**: Employ conditional sentences when discussing potential applications of patterns. For instance, "If we apply the branching pattern to our water distribution system, it could improve efficiency."

- **Comparative and Superlative Adjectives**: Utilize these when comparing different patterns or design elements. For example, "The spiral pattern is more compact than the branching pattern" or "The tessellation pattern is the most efficient for maximizing space."

- **Imperative Mood**: Use imperative sentences when giving instructions for the design activity. For instance, "Create a simple permaculture design incorporating at least one natural pattern."

- **Present Perfect Tense**: Apply this tense when discussing observations and experiences with patterns in nature. For example, "Many of you have observed these patterns in your daily lives."
