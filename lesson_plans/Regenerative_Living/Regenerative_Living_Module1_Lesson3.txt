By incorporating the observation explanations into the sample projects, students can better understand the specific requirements and considerations for each project, and how to apply their observations to the design and implementation phases.
By understanding what to look for when observing these factors, students can gather valuable information to inform their permaculture designs and make informed decisions about plant selection, placement, and care.
By including the implementation phase in the sample projects, TEFL learners will have a clear understanding of the steps involved in bringing their permaculture designs to life. They can use these examples as a guide for their own projects, adapting the methods to suit their specific context and resources.

Worksheet questions:
1. What did you observe about your garden area, and how did it influence your design?
2. What materials did you use for your project, and why?
3. How did you apply permaculture principles in your design?
4. What challenges did you face during the implementation, and how did you overcome them?
5. What did you learn from this project, and how can you apply this knowledge in the future?

By completing this lesson plan and homework assignment, TEFL learners will gain hands-on experience with permaculture design methods and develop a deeper understanding of how to create sustainable and regenerative systems.
