Introduction (10 minutes)

Explain the importance of mapping and site assessment in permaculture design
Discuss the key elements to consider when assessing a site (e.g., topography, water sources, soil types, existing vegetation)


Mapping Techniques (10 minutes)

Introduce different mapping techniques (e.g., hand-drawn maps, GPS mapping, aerial photography)
Demonstrate how to create a base map using Folium library in Python
Show examples of maps with heat maps, colored areas, and points of interest


Site Assessment (10 minutes)

Explain the process of conducting a site assessment
Discuss the factors to consider when assessing a site (e.g., sun exposure, wind patterns, microclimates, water flow)

Group Activity (30 minutes)

Provide each group with a base map of a hypothetical site
Ask the groups to conduct a site assessment based on their assigned factor and add relevant information to the map using colored areas, heat maps, or points of interest
Encourage the groups to use the Folium library to create their maps
Give them the source code for the sample map in the scripts folder, mapping.py.

Conclusion (10 minutes)

Summarize the key points of the lesson
Emphasize the significance of mapping and site assessment in permaculture design
Encourage students to apply these techniques in their own permaculture projects
