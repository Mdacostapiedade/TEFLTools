Introduction (10 minutes)

Explain the importance of mapping and site assessment in permaculture design
Discuss the key elements to consider when assessing a site (e.g., topography, water sources, soil types, existing vegetation)


Mapping Techniques (20 minutes)

Introduce different mapping techniques (e.g., hand-drawn maps, GPS mapping, aerial photography)
Demonstrate how to create a base map using Folium library in Python
Show examples of maps with heat maps, colored areas, and points of interest


Site Assessment (30 minutes)

Explain the process of conducting a site assessment
Discuss the factors to consider when assessing a site (e.g., sun exposure, wind patterns, microclimates, water flow)
Divide the class into groups and assign each group a different site assessment factor to analyze


Group Activity (30 minutes)

Provide each group with a base map of a hypothetical site
Ask the groups to conduct a site assessment based on their assigned factor and add relevant information to the map using colored areas, heat maps, or points of interest
Encourage the groups to use the Folium library to create their maps


Presentation and Discussion (20 minutes)

Have each group present their site assessment findings and maps to the class
Facilitate a discussion on the importance of considering multiple factors in site assessment and how they interact with each other


Conclusion (10 minutes)

Summarize the key points of the lesson
Emphasize the significance of mapping and site assessment in permaculture design
Encourage students to apply these techniques in their own permaculture projects
