Introduction (10 minutes)

Explain the importance of mapping and site assessment in permaculture design
Discuss the key elements to consider when assessing a site (e.g., topography, water sources, soil types, existing vegetation)


Mapping Techniques (10 minutes)

Introduce different mapping techniques (e.g., hand-drawn maps, GPS mapping, aerial photography)
Demonstrate how to create a base map using Folium library in Python
Show examples of maps with heat maps, colored areas, and points of interest


Site Assessment (10 minutes)

Explain the process of conducting a site assessment
Discuss the factors to consider when assessing a site (e.g., sun exposure, wind patterns, microclimates, water flow)

Group Activity (30 minutes)

Provide each group with a base map of a hypothetical site
Ask the groups to conduct a site assessment based on their assigned factor and add relevant information to the map using colored areas, heat maps, or points of interest
Encourage the groups to use the Folium library to create their maps
Give them the source code for the sample map in the scripts folder, mapping.py.

Conclusion (10 minutes)

Summarize the key points of the lesson
Emphasize the significance of mapping and site assessment in permaculture design
Encourage students to apply these techniques in their own permaculture projects

Here's a Grammar Points section for the lesson plan, formatted as requested:

## Grammar Points:

- Use of prepositions to describe location and spatial relationships:
  - "on the map" vs. "in the area"
  - "at the site" vs. "in the site"
  - "through the landscape" vs. "across the terrain"

- Present participles for describing ongoing processes:
  - "assessing the site"
  - "mapping the area"
  - "conducting a survey"

- Conditional sentences for hypothetical scenarios:
  - "If we were to implement this design, we would..."
  - "Should we find a water source here, it could be used for..."

- Comparative and superlative adjectives for discussing site features:
  - "The southern slope is steeper than the northern one."
  - "This is the most suitable area for planting."

- Prepositional phrases for describing movement and direction:
  - "water flowing down the slope"
  - "wind patterns moving across the site"
  - "sun exposure throughout the day"
