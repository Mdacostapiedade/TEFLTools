Here is a draft lesson plan for Module 1: Foundations of Permaculture - Local environmental and cultural contexts, focused on Timor Leste:

Lesson Objectives:
- Students will be able to describe key aspects of Timor Leste's environment and geography relevant to permaculture 
- Students will understand how Timorese cultural practices and values relate to permaculture principles
- Students will identify locally available resources and traditional knowledge that can inform permaculture design

Lesson Activities:

1. Warm-up (2 min): 
- Show a series of images depicting Timor Leste's diverse landscapes, traditional agriculture, and local crops. Have students identify what they see and share any personal connections or observations.

2. Environment Overview (10 min) (see environmental overview txt in Readings folder):
- Present key facts about Timor Leste's climate (tropical with distinct rainy and dry seasons), topography (mountainous with coastal plains), and major ecosystem types (tropical forests, savannas, coral reefs).  
- Highlight environmental challenges such as deforestation, soil erosion, and irregular rainfall, and discuss how permaculture strategies like tree planting, soil conservation, and water harvesting could help address these.
- Identify native plants and animals that play important roles in local ecology and could be valuable in permaculture systems.

3. Cultural Context (10 min) (see traditional Timorese permaculture practices in Readings folder):
- Discuss the central importance of agriculture and land stewardship in Timorese culture. Note the prevalence of subsistence farming and the deep cultural ties to specific crops like corn, rice, cassava, and coffee.
- Highlight Timorese values around community cooperation, sharing of resources and knowledge, and living in harmony with nature. Connect these to permaculture ethics of earth care, people care, and fair share.  
- Identify traditional practices like tara bandu (community land management agreements), ai-parapa (mixed perennial food forests), and saving diversity of heirloom seed varieties as examples of embedded permaculture principles.

4. Local Resources Brainstorm (20 min):
- Break students into small groups and have them brainstorm lists of locally available resources that could be useful in permaculture design, such as:
    - Renewable materials like bamboo, rattan, coconut fibers, etc. for building and crafts
    - Biomass like chicken manure, rice hulls, and food scraps for composting
    - Locally adapted, multi-purpose plants and native species for agroforestry 
    - Sources of local knowledge like village elders experienced in traditional farming

5. Design Challenge (20 min):
- Still in small groups, have students discuss how they would approach designing a permaculture site in their local area. Prompt them to consider:
    - Specific environmental conditions and challenges of the site
    - Cultural practices and values to incorporate
    - Local resources to utilize
    - Knowledge and skills needed 
- Have them finish their project idea as homework in writing as a project plan.

By the end of this lesson, students should have a foundational understanding of how permaculture principles can be applied in the specific environmental and cultural context of Timor Leste. They will see the value of their own local knowledge and resources, and be primed to start learning and applying design tools to create truly sustainable and resilient systems in their communities.

## Grammar Points:

1. Using the present simple tense to describe general facts about Timor Leste's environment and culture:
   - Example: "Timor Leste has a tropical climate with distinct rainy and dry seasons."
   - Question: "What type of climate does Timor Leste have?"
   - Negative: "Timor Leste does not have a temperate climate."

2. Employing the present perfect tense to discuss ongoing environmental challenges:
   - Example: "Deforestation has been a significant problem in Timor Leste."
   - Question: "How long has deforestation been an issue in Timor Leste?"
   - Negative: "Soil erosion hasn't improved in recent years."

3. Using conditional sentences to explore permaculture solutions:
   - Example: "If we implement water harvesting techniques, we could address irregular rainfall issues."
   - Question: "What would happen if we planted more trees in deforested areas?"
   - Negative: "If we don't address soil erosion, crop yields won't improve."

4. Utilizing comparative and superlative forms to discuss local resources:
   - Example: "Bamboo is more versatile than many other building materials."
   - Question: "Which local resource is the most useful for permaculture design?"
   - Negative: "Traditional farming methods aren't less effective than modern techniques."

5. Using modal verbs to express possibilities and suggestions in permaculture design:
   - Example: "We could incorporate tara bandu practices into our permaculture design."
   - Question: "How might we adapt traditional practices to modern permaculture systems?"
   - Negative: "We shouldn't ignore local knowledge when designing permaculture sites."
