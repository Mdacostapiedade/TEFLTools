Lesson Duration: 90 minutes
Lesson Procedure:

Introduction (10 minutes):

Greet the students and introduce the topic of the water cycle and watershed hydrology
Ask students what they already know about the water cycle and watersheds
Explain the objectives of the lesson


Vocabulary Introduction (15 minutes):

Introduce key vocabulary related to the water cycle and watersheds (e.g., evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, runoff, infiltration, watershed, catchment, tributary, river basin)
Evaporation: The process by which liquid water is converted into water vapor, typically due to the application of heat energy from the sun.

Transpiration: The process by which plants release water vapor into the atmosphere through their leaves.

Condensation: The process by which water vapor in the air is converted into liquid water droplets, typically due to cooling.

Precipitation: Water that falls from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail.

Runoff: The portion of precipitation or other water sources that flows over the land surface and enters streams, rivers, or other bodies of water.

Infiltration: The movement of water from the surface into the soil or other porous materials.

Watershed: An area of land that drains water into a particular river, lake, or other body of water.

Catchment: Another term for a watershed, referring to the area of land that drains into a specific body of water.

Tributary: A smaller stream or river that flows into a larger stream or river.

River basin: The entire area of land drained by a river and its tributaries, including all the surface water and underground water sources.

Write the terms on the whiteboard and provide simple definitions
Have students practice pronouncing the words and using them in sentences

Water Cycle Explanation (20 minutes):

Display a diagram of the water cycle on the whiteboard or projector
Explain each stage of the water cycle (evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, runoff) using simple language and examples
Show a short video or animation of the water cycle to reinforce the concepts (see resources)
Have students label the stages of the water cycle on a printed handout


Watershed Introduction (20 minutes):

Introduce the concept of a watershed as an area of land that drains into a common body of water
Show a map of Timor Leste's major watersheds and explain their importance for water management and ecosystem health
Discuss the components of a watershed (e.g., rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, groundwater) and how they are interconnected;
    A watershed is a complex and interconnected system consisting of various components that play crucial roles in the water cycle. The main components of a watershed include:
    
    1. Rivers and Streams:
      Rivers and streams are the primary channels that carry water from higher elevations to lower elevations within a watershed. They serve as the main drainage systems, collecting water from various sources and transporting it downstream.
    
    2. Lakes and Reservoirs:
      Lakes and reservoirs are natural or artificial water bodies that act as storage areas within a watershed. They receive water from rivers, streams, and groundwater sources, and can also contribute to the water flow through outlets or spillways.
    
    3. Wetlands:
      Wetlands are areas saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally. They play a vital role in the watershed by filtering pollutants, mitigating floods, and providing habitats for various plant and animal species. Wetlands can be fed by rivers, streams, groundwater, or surface runoff.
    
    4. Groundwater:
      Groundwater is the water that exists beneath the Earth's surface in aquifers or other underground formations. It is an essential component of the watershed, as it can feed streams, rivers, and wetlands through springs or seeps, and it can also be recharged by surface water infiltration.
    
    5. Surface Runoff:
      Surface runoff is the water that flows over the land surface after precipitation or snowmelt, instead of infiltrating into the ground. This runoff can contribute to streams, rivers, and other water bodies within the watershed.
    
    These components of a watershed are interconnected and interdependent. Rivers and streams transport water from higher elevations to lower elevations, collecting water from various sources along the way, including surface runoff, groundwater discharge, and contributions from lakes and wetlands. Wetlands and groundwater systems play crucial roles in regulating water flow, filtering pollutants, and sustaining aquatic ecosystems within the watershed.
    
    The health and functioning of a watershed depend on the balance and interactions among these components. Human activities, such as urbanization, agriculture, and industrial development, can impact the watershed by altering water quality, quantity, and flow patterns, affecting the entire ecosystem.
    Have students identify the watershed in which their community is located

Small Group Activity (15 minutes):

Divide students into small groups of 3-4
Provide each group with a map of a fictional watershed and have them label the main components (rivers, tributaries, lakes, etc.)
Have groups brainstorm how different land use activities (e.g., farming, deforestation, urban development) might impact the watershed and water cycle


Vocabulary Review (5 minutes):

Distribute index cards with the key vocabulary terms and have students write the definitions on the back
Have students quiz each other in pairs or small groups


Conclusion (5 minutes):

Summarize the main points of the lesson
Encourage students to think about how the water cycle and watersheds are important in their own lives and communities
Preview the next lesson on water harvesting and storage techniques



Extension Activity:

Have students create a poster or infographic explaining the water cycle and the importance of watershed conservation in Timor Leste
Encourage students to research and present on traditional Timorese practices related to water management and conservation
