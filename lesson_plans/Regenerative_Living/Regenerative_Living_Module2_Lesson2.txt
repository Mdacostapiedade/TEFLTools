Lesson Objectives:

Students will be able to understand and explain the importance of water harvesting for aquaculture in Timor-Leste.
Students will learn about different water harvesting techniques such as swales, ponds, tanks, and cisterns.
Students will understand the process of setting up and maintaining a fish pond.
Students will learn and practice using vocabulary related to water harvesting and aquaculture.

Materials:

Handouts with the "Water Harvesting for Aquaculture" reading passage
Vocabulary worksheet
Whiteboard and markers

Warm-up (10 minutes):

Ask students what they know about water harvesting and aquaculture in Timor-Leste. Write their responses on the board.
Introduce the topic and explain that they will be reading about water harvesting techniques for aquaculture.

Reading (30 minutes):

Distribute the handouts with the reading passage.
Have students read the passage silently.
Pair students and have them take turns reading the passage aloud to each other.
Encourage students to underline or highlight any unfamiliar words or phrases.

Vocabulary (20 minutes):

Write the vocabulary words on the board: contour, recharge, reservoir, cistern, erosion, ecosystem.
Have students work in pairs to find the words in the reading and try to guess their meanings based on context.
Provide students with the vocabulary worksheet and have them match the words to their definitions.
Review the answers as a class and clarify any questions.

Comprehension (30 minutes):

Divide the class into small groups.
Assign each group a section of the reading (Building Swales, Building a Water Storage Pond, Installing a Rainwater Tank or Cistern, Integrating with Your Fish Pond, Building a Fish Pond).
Have each group read their section and summarize the main steps involved.
Ask each group to present their summary to the class.

Discussion (20 minutes):

Lead a class discussion on the importance of water harvesting for aquaculture in Timor-Leste.
Ask students to share their thoughts on which water harvesting technique they think would be most effective and why.
Encourage students to think about how these techniques could be implemented in their own communities.

Wrap-up (10 minutes):

Review the main points of the lesson.
Ask students to share one new thing they learned about water harvesting and aquaculture.
Assign homework: have students write a paragraph explaining how they would set up a fish pond using the water harvesting techniques they learned about.

Here's a Grammar Points section for the lesson plan, formatted as requested:

## Grammar Points:

- Present Simple Tense: Used to describe general facts and processes related to water harvesting and aquaculture (e.g., "Swales capture and direct water," "Fish ponds require regular maintenance").

- Passive Voice: Commonly used in technical descriptions of water harvesting techniques and fish pond setup (e.g., "Water is collected in cisterns," "The pond is lined with clay or plastic").

- Imperative Mood: Used for giving instructions on how to build and maintain water harvesting systems and fish ponds (e.g., "Dig the swale along the contour line," "Monitor water quality regularly").

- Present Perfect Tense: Useful for discussing the results and effects of water harvesting techniques (e.g., "The swale has prevented soil erosion," "The rainwater tank has provided a steady water supply").

- Conditional Sentences: Helpful when discussing potential applications and benefits of water harvesting techniques (e.g., "If we implement these techniques, we could increase fish production," "Water scarcity would be less of an issue if more people used these methods").
