Lesson Title: Understanding Keyline Design for Water Management

Objectives:
- Students will understand the basic principles of Keyline design
- Students will learn vocabulary related to Keyline design and water management
- Students will practice using the simple present tense to describe how Keyline design works

Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Printouts of Keyline design diagrams and definitions of key terms
- Worksheets for vocabulary and grammar practice

Warm-up (10 minutes):
- Ask students what they know about managing water in agriculture or gardening. Write their ideas on the board.
- Introduce the topic of Keyline design as a method for managing water in the landscape.

Lesson Development:
Part 1: Introduction to Keyline Design (20 minutes) - see Readings folder
- Explain the basic principles of Keyline design, using diagrams to illustrate:
  - Keylines are contour lines that run perpendicular to the slope
  - Keyline ripping or plowing is used to increase water infiltration and storage
  - Dams, ponds, and swales are used to store and direct water along the Keylines
- Introduce key vocabulary terms (see below) and have students repeat the pronunciation.

Part 2: Vocabulary Practice (20 minutes)
- Distribute the vocabulary worksheets and have students work in pairs to match the terms with their definitions.
- Review the answers as a class and clarify any questions.
- Have students practice using the new vocabulary in sentences related to Keyline design.

Part 3: Grammar Practice (20 minutes)
- Explain that the simple present tense is often used to describe how things work or happen.
- Provide examples of simple present tense sentences related to Keyline design, e.g.:
  - "Keyline design helps to distribute water evenly across the landscape."
  - "Keyline ripping increases water infiltration into the soil."
- Distribute the grammar worksheets and have students complete the exercises on using the simple present tense.
- Review the answers as a class and provide additional examples as needed.

Part 4: Application (20 minutes)
- Divide the class into small groups and assign each group a different aspect of Keyline design (e.g., Keyline ripping, dams and ponds, swales).
- Have each group prepare a short presentation explaining their assigned aspect, using the simple present tense and the new vocabulary terms.
- Have each group present to the class and encourage questions and discussion.

Wrap-up (10 minutes):
- Review the main points of the lesson and the key vocabulary terms.
- Encourage students to think about how Keyline design principles could be applied in their own communities or gardens.

Vocabulary:
- Keyline: A contour line that runs perpendicular to the slope
- Contour: A line connecting points of equal elevation
- Ripping: The process of deep tilling or plowing along Keylines
- Infiltration: The process by which water enters the soil
- Swale: A shallow, vegetated channel designed to slow and capture runoff
- Berm: A raised bank or shelf along the downhill side of a swale, often planted with trees or other vegetation

Grammar:
- Simple Present Tense: Used to describe habitual actions, general truths, or how things work
