Lesson Plan: Module 2 - Water Wisdom
Topic: Drought-proofing Strategies for Timor Leste

Lesson Objectives:
1. Understand the water cycle and watershed hydrology in Timor Leste
2. Learn various water harvesting and storage techniques
3. Explore drought-proofing strategies based on southern India case study
4. Develop a drought-proofing plan for a Timorese community

I. Introduction (15 minutes)
A. Overview of Timor Leste's climate and water challenges
B. Importance of drought-proofing in the context of climate change

II. Water Cycle and Watershed Hydrology (30 minutes)
See the Water Cycle and Watershed Hydrology text and the Watershed and Water Movement text in the Readings folder.
A. Basic principles of the water cycle
B. Characteristics of Timor Leste's watersheds
C. Impact of topography on water distribution

III. Water Harvesting and Storage Techniques (45 minutes)
See Waterharvesting for Aquaculture and Building a Fish Pond Story in Readings.
A. Traditional methods in Timor Leste
B. Modern approaches:
   1. Swales
   2. Ponds
   3. Tanks and cisterns
C. Demonstration: Design a basic rainwater harvesting system

IV. Case Study: Drought-proofing Strategies in Southern India (45 minutes)
See the drought slideshow gear in the scripts folder.
A. Overview of the study
B. Key findings:
   1. Supply management strategies
   2. Demand management strategies
C. Effectiveness of different measures
   - Discuss the simple rate of return for various drought-proofing measures:
     Farm Trenches (7%), Field Plastic Mulches (11%), Drip Irrigation (20%),
     Farm Pond (9.5%), Percolation Pond (10.5%), Borewell Recharge (8.5%),
     New Borewell (9.5%), Water Purchase (19%)
   - Highlight that drip irrigation and water purchase show the highest returns

V. Adapting Strategies for Timor Leste (60 minutes)
A. Group discussion: Applicability of Indian strategies to Timor Leste
B. Identifying local resources and constraints
C. Developing a community-based drought-proofing plan:
   1. Water supply enhancement
   2. Demand management
   3. Community participation and education

VI. Practical Exercise: Designing a Drought-proofing Plan (60 minutes)
A. Divide participants into groups
B. Each group creates a drought-proofing plan for a hypothetical Timorese village
C. Groups present their plans and receive feedback

VII. Conclusion and Q&A (15 minutes)
A. Recap of key drought-proofing strategies
B. Importance of locally adapted solutions
C. Next steps for implementation

Additional Resources:
1. Timor Leste meteorological data
2. Local NGOs working on water management
3. Government policies on water resources

Assessment:
1. Group presentation of drought-proofing plans
2. Individual reflection on how to apply learnings in their communities

This lesson plan provides a comprehensive approach to learning about drought-proofing strategies, with a specific focus on adapting knowledge from the southern India case study to the context of Timor Leste. It combines theoretical learning with practical application, encouraging participants to think critically about how to implement these strategies in their local communities.

## Grammar Points:

- Passive Voice: Emphasize the use of passive voice when discussing processes and techniques, e.g., "Water is harvested through various methods" or "Drought-proofing strategies are implemented to conserve water."

- Conditional Sentences: Use conditional sentences to discuss hypothetical scenarios and potential outcomes, e.g., "If we implement these water harvesting techniques, the community's water supply would be more stable."

- Comparative and Superlative Forms: Employ these forms when comparing different drought-proofing strategies, e.g., "Drip irrigation is more efficient than traditional irrigation methods" or "The most effective strategy for this region is rainwater harvesting."

- Present Perfect Tense: Utilize this tense to discuss ongoing or recently completed actions related to water management, e.g., "The community has adopted several water conservation measures over the past year."

- Modals for Possibility and Necessity: Use modal verbs to express the likelihood and importance of various drought-proofing measures, e.g., "We must implement these strategies to ensure water security" or "This approach could significantly improve water availability."
