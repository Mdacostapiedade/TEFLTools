    B. Group discussion on potential applications in participants' communities

V. Conclusion and Next Steps (5 minutes)
   A. Recap key points
   B. Assign homework: Research local regulations and potential sites for greywater systems

VI. Q&A Session (10 minutes)

## Grammar Points:

- Use of conditional statements (e.g., "If we implement a greywater system, we can reduce water consumption") to discuss potential benefits and outcomes of water reuse systems.

- Proper use of technical terminology and compound nouns (e.g., "greywater system," "composting toilet") when describing components and concepts related to water management.

- Employing comparative and superlative forms (e.g., "more efficient," "best practices") to evaluate different water treatment methods and design approaches.

- Correct use of pronouns in discussions about water systems:
  - Use "it" to refer to a specific system or component (e.g., "The greywater system is efficient because it reuses household water").
  - Use "they" to refer to multiple systems or components (e.g., "Greywater systems are beneficial because they conserve water").
  - Use "we" to discuss collective actions or decisions (e.g., "We should consider implementing a greywater system in our community").

- Appropriate use of modal verbs (e.g., "can," "should," "must") to discuss possibilities, recommendations, and regulations related to greywater and blackwater systems.
