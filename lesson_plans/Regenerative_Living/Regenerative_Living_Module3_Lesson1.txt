Lesson Plan: Introduction to Soil Science Basics

Duration: 90 minutes

Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Define soil and explain its importance in ecosystems
2. Describe the basic structure of soil, including horizons
3. Identify key chemical components and processes in soil
4. Explain the biological aspects of soil systems

Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Soil samples (sand, clay, loam)
- Soil texture triangle diagram
- Handouts with soil profile diagrams

I. Introduction (10 minutes)
   A. Begin with the quote: "From soil comes everything."
   B. Discuss the significance of soil in supporting life and ecosystems

II. Soil Structure (25 minutes)
    A. Define soil as a dynamic ecosystem with inputs, outputs, storages, and flows
    B. Explain soil horizons and profile
       1. Show and label a soil profile diagram
       2. Discuss the components of each horizon (O, A, B, C, R)
    C. Introduce soil texture
       1. Demonstrate the soil texture triangle
       2. Compare and contrast sand, clay, and loam soils

III. Soil Chemistry (20 minutes)
     A. Discuss key chemical components in soil
        1. Organic matter
        2. Minerals
        3. Nutrients (focus on NPK - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)
     B. Explain chemical processes in soil
        1. Weathering
        2. Nutrient cycling
        3. pH and its importance

IV. Soil Biology (20 minutes)
    A. Introduce the concept of soil as an ecosystem
    B. Discuss soil organisms and their roles
       1. Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi)
       2. Macro-organisms (earthworms, insects)
    C. Explain the soil food web
       1. Show a diagram of a soil food web
       2. Discuss energy flow and nutrient cycling

V. Hands-on Activity: Soil Texture Analysis (10 minutes)
   A. Provide students with different soil samples
   B. Guide them through the "soil texture by feel" flowchart

VI. Conclusion and Discussion (5 minutes)
    A. Recap key points about soil structure, chemistry, and biology
    B. Discuss the importance of soil conservation

VII. Assignment
     Students to create a simple systems diagram of the soil system, including:
     - Inputs (organic material, inorganic matter, precipitation, energy)
     - Storages (organic matter, organisms, nutrients, minerals, air, water)
     - Outputs (leaching, plant uptake, erosion)
     - Transfers and transformations within the soil
