        2. Bedding materials
        3. Feeding and maintenance
     C. Demonstration: Setting up a vermicompost bin (10 minutes)
        1. Prepare bedding
        2. Add worms and food scraps
        3. Discuss proper care and harvesting

IV. Mulching (35 minutes)
    A. Define mulching and its benefits (10 minutes)
       1. Moisture retention
       2. Weed suppression
       3. Temperature regulation
       4. Soil structure improvement
    B. Discuss different types of mulch (10 minutes)
       1. Organic vs. inorganic mulches
       2. Pros and cons of various materials
    C. Hands-on activity: Apply mulch to a garden bed (15 minutes)
       1. Demonstrate proper mulching technique
       2. Show appropriate depth for different materials
       3. Discuss timing of mulch application

V. Conclusion and Discussion (10 minutes)
   A. Recap key points about each soil building strategy
   B. Discuss how these strategies can be integrated into sustainable farming practices
   C. Address any questions from students

VI. Assignment
    Students to design a soil building plan for a small garden plot, incorporating at least two of the strategies learned in class. The plan should include:
    - Materials needed
    - Step-by-step process
    - Expected benefits to soil health
    - Potential challenges and how to address them

## Grammar Points:

- Word Formation: Practice forming nouns, verbs, and adjectives related to soil building concepts. For example:
  - Compost (noun) → Composting (gerund/noun) → Compostable (adjective)
  - Vermiculture (noun) → Vermicompost (noun) → Vermicomposting (gerund/noun)
  - Mulch (noun/verb) → Mulching (gerund/noun) → Mulched (past participle/adjective)

- Imperative Mood: Use imperative sentences when giving instructions for hands-on activities, such as "Layer the materials" or "Turn the compost pile."

- Passive Voice: Employ passive voice when describing processes, e.g., "Organic matter is broken down by microorganisms" or "The soil structure is improved through mulching."

- Conditional Sentences: Utilize conditional sentences to discuss potential outcomes of soil building strategies, such as "If we add compost to the soil, it will improve fertility" or "Should the compost become too dry, add water to maintain moisture."

- Comparative and Superlative Forms: Use these forms when discussing different types of mulch or composting methods, e.g., "Wood chips retain moisture better than straw" or "Vermicomposting is the fastest method for producing nutrient-rich castings."
