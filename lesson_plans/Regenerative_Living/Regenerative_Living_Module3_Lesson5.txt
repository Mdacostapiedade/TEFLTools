     B. Discuss how these parameters relate to bioremediation potential

VIII. Conclusion and Discussion (10 minutes)
      A. Recap key points about bioremediation and soil restoration
      B. Discuss future trends and emerging technologies in the field
      C. Address any questions from students

IX. Assignment
    Students to research and present a proposal for a bioremediation project addressing a specific contamination scenario. The proposal should include:
    - Description of the contamination problem
    - Chosen bioremediation technique(s) and justification
    - Expected timeline and potential challenges
    - Monitoring and success evaluation plan
    - Consideration of environmental and social impacts

## Grammar Points:

- Use of passive voice to describe processes: "Contaminated soil is treated using bioremediation techniques." This structure is common when explaining scientific procedures and emphasizes the action rather than the actor.

- Conditional sentences to discuss potential outcomes: "If we implement phytoremediation, the soil quality could improve significantly within a year." This structure is useful when discussing hypothetical scenarios or predicting results of bioremediation projects.

- Present perfect tense to describe ongoing or recently completed processes: "Microorganisms have broken down the organic pollutants in the soil." This tense is helpful when discussing the current state of a bioremediation project or its effects.

- Comparative and superlative forms to contrast techniques: "In-situ bioremediation is often more cost-effective than ex-situ methods, but ex-situ bioremediation may be the most efficient for heavily contaminated sites." These forms are useful when comparing different bioremediation approaches.

- Complex sentences using subordinating conjunctions to show cause and effect: "Because heavy metals cannot be biodegraded, phytoremediation is used to extract them from the soil." This structure helps students articulate the relationships between contamination types and appropriate remediation techniques.
