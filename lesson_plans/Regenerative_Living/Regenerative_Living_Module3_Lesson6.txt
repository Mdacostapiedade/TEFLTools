IX. Assignment
    Students to research and present on one specific application of activated charcoal. The presentation should include:
    - Description of the application
    - How activated charcoal's properties are utilized in this application
    - Production or preparation method for this specific use
    - Benefits and potential drawbacks
    - Environmental considerations

## Grammar Points:

- Passive Voice: Used frequently when describing production processes and applications of activated charcoal. For example, "Activated charcoal is produced by carbonizing organic materials."

- Conditional Sentences: Useful when discussing potential applications and environmental impacts. For instance, "If we use activated charcoal in soil, it could improve water retention."

- Comparative and Superlative Adjectives: Helpful when comparing activated charcoal to regular charcoal or other materials. Example: "Activated charcoal has a higher surface area than regular charcoal."

- Reported Speech: Important for discussing research findings and expert opinions about activated charcoal. For example:
  - Direct: The scientist said, "Activated charcoal can effectively remove toxins from water."
  - Reported: The scientist stated that activated charcoal could effectively remove toxins from water.

- Technical Vocabulary and Noun Phrases: Essential for accurately describing the properties and processes related to activated charcoal. For example, "high surface area," "adsorption capabilities," "carbonization process."
