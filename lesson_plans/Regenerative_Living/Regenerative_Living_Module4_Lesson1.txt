Lesson Plan: Module 4 - Perennial Food Systems
Resources: See the Readings folder
Topic: Food Forests and Forest Gardening

Objectives:
- Define food forests and forest gardens
- Understand the principles and benefits of food forests
- Learn how to design and establish a food forest

Warm-up (10 minutes):
- Show pictures of food forests and forest gardens
- Ask students what they observe and if they have seen anything similar

Presentation (20 minutes):
- Explain the concept of food forests and forest gardens
- Discuss the principles of layering, diversity, and perennial plants
- Highlight the benefits: resilience, low maintenance, productivity

Activity (30 minutes):
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a sample site plan and a list of suitable plants
- Ask them to design a food forest for the given site, considering layers, guilds, etc.
- Have groups present their designs and provide feedback

Break (10 minutes)

Practical Demonstration (40 minutes):
- Take students to a nearby food forest or permaculture site (if available)
- Identify and discuss the different layers, plants, and their functions
- Demonstrate techniques for planting, pruning, and maintaining a food forest

Closing (10 minutes):
- Recap the key concepts and principles of food forests
- Encourage students to start small and experiment with food forests at home
- Assign further reading or research on food forests for the next class

Materials Needed:
- Pictures of food forests and forest gardens
- Sample site plans and plant lists for the activity
- Access to a nearby food forest or permaculture site (if possible)

Assessment:
- Evaluate the group activity designs for understanding of concepts
- Observe participation and engagement during the practical demonstration
- Assign a short reflective writing assignment on the benefits of food forests

Note: This lesson plan can be adapted based on the available resources and the level of the students. It may need to be spread over multiple sessions to cover the topic comprehensively.

## Grammar Points:

- Use of comparative adjectives to describe the benefits of food forests (e.g., "more resilient," "less maintenance," "higher productivity")

- Employing conditional sentences to discuss potential outcomes in food forest design (e.g., "If we plant nitrogen-fixing trees, then the soil will improve")

- Utilizing present participles to describe ongoing processes in food forests (e.g., "layering," "establishing," "maintaining")

- Incorporating conjunctions to connect ideas and explain relationships between elements in food forests:
  - Coordinating conjunctions (e.g., "and," "but," "or") to link plant species or forest layers
  - Subordinating conjunctions (e.g., "because," "although," "while") to explain cause-and-effect relationships in food forest ecosystems
  - Correlative conjunctions (e.g., "both...and," "not only...but also") to emphasize multiple benefits or characteristics of food forests

- Using imperative sentences for giving instructions during the practical demonstration (e.g., "Plant the tree seedlings here," "Prune the branches carefully")
