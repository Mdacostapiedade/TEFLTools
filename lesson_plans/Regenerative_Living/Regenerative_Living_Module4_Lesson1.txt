- Have groups present their designs and provide feedback

Break (10 minutes)

Practical Demonstration (40 minutes):
- Take students to a nearby food forest or permaculture site (if available)
- Identify and discuss the different layers, plants, and their functions
- Demonstrate techniques for planting, pruning, and maintaining a food forest

Closing (10 minutes):
- Recap the key concepts and principles of food forests
- Encourage students to start small and experiment with food forests at home
- Assign further reading or research on food forests for the next class

Materials Needed:
- Pictures of food forests and forest gardens
- Sample site plans and plant lists for the activity
- Access to a nearby food forest or permaculture site (if possible)

Assessment:
- Evaluate the group activity designs for understanding of concepts
- Observe participation and engagement during the practical demonstration
- Assign a short reflective writing assignment on the benefits of food forests

Note: This lesson plan can be adapted based on the available resources and the level of the students. It may need to be spread over multiple sessions to cover the topic comprehensively.
