      A. Recap key points about agroforestry and silvopasture
      B. Discuss future trends and potential for scaling up these systems
      C. Address any questions from students

IX. Assignment
    Students to research and present on a traditional agroforestry system from a specific culture or region. The presentation should include:
    - Description of the system and its components
    - Historical and cultural context
    - Ecological and economic benefits
    - Challenges and adaptations over time
    - Potential applications or lessons for modern agroforestry

## Grammar Points:

- Use of prepositions to describe spatial relationships in agroforestry systems:
  - "Trees are planted *between* rows of crops in alley cropping."
  - "Livestock graze *under* the tree canopy in silvopasture systems."
  - "Windbreaks are established *along* field boundaries."

- Proper use of comparative and superlative forms when discussing benefits:
  - "Agroforestry systems are *more productive* than monocultures."
  - "Silvopasture can be *the most efficient* use of land for combined timber and livestock production."

- Correct use of prepositions in phrases related to environmental processes:
  - "Carbon is sequestered *in* the soil and *above* ground in tree biomass."
  - "Nutrients cycle *through* the system, moving *from* trees *to* soil *to* crops."

- Use of conditional sentences when discussing system design:
  - "If the climate is arid, then drought-resistant species should be selected."
  - "Were we to implement this system in a temperate region, we would choose different tree species."

- Proper use of prepositions in phrases describing integration and interaction:
  - "The integration *of* trees *with* crops or livestock"
  - "The interaction *between* different components *in* the system"
