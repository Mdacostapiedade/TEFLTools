Resources: See Readings folder
Duration: 120 minutes

Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of perennial food systems and their importance in Timor-Leste
2. Identify key perennial vegetables, fruits, nuts, and staples native to or well-adapted to Timor-Leste
3. Explain the benefits of perennial crops in the context of Timor-Leste's climate and ecology
4. Describe basic cultivation and management techniques for selected perennial crops
5. Design a small-scale perennial food system suitable for a Timorese context

Materials:

VI. Hands-on Activity: Design a Perennial Food System (25 minutes)
    A. Divide class into small groups
    B. Each group designs a small-scale perennial food system for a Timorese family or community
    C. Groups present their designs, explaining crop choices and layout

VII. Challenges and Considerations (10 minutes)
     A. Land tenure issues in Timor-Leste
     B. Market access for perennial crops
     C. Balancing perennials with annual crop needs

      B. Discuss potential for scaling up perennial systems in the country
      C. Address any questions from students

IX. Assignment
    Students to research and present on a traditional Timorese perennial crop system. The presentation should include:
    - Description of the system and its components
    - Historical and cultural context
    - Ecological and economic benefits
    - Current challenges and potential solutions
    - Ideas for integrating traditional knowledge with modern sustainable practices

## Grammar Points:

- Present Simple for describing characteristics and benefits of perennial crops:
  - Positive: "Cassava grows well in poor soil."
  - Negative: "Breadfruit does not require frequent replanting."
  - Question: "How does moringa contribute to nutrition?"

- Present Continuous for ongoing processes in perennial systems:
  - Positive: "The sago palm is constantly producing new shoots."
  - Negative: "The mango trees are not flowering this season."
  - Question: "Are the coconut palms adapting to the changing climate?"

- Future Simple for discussing potential outcomes and plans:
  - Positive: "Perennial food systems will improve food security."
  - Negative: "Annual crops won't provide the same long-term benefits."
  - Question: "Will perennial systems reduce labor requirements?"

- Comparative and Superlative forms for contrasting crop types:
  - Positive: "Perennial crops are more resilient than annual crops."
  - Negative: "Annual crops are not as sustainable as perennial crops."
  - Question: "Which perennial crop is the most drought-tolerant?"

- Modal verbs for discussing possibilities and recommendations:
  - Positive: "Farmers should consider integrating more perennials."
  - Negative: "We shouldn't overlook traditional perennial systems."
  - Question: "How can we best promote perennial food systems in Timor-Leste?"
