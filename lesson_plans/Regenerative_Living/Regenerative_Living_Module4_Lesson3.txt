Lesson Plan: Perennial Food Systems in Timor-Leste

Duration: 120 minutes

Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of perennial food systems and their importance in Timor-Leste
2. Identify key perennial vegetables, fruits, nuts, and staples native to or well-adapted to Timor-Leste
3. Explain the benefits of perennial crops in the context of Timor-Leste's climate and ecology
4. Describe basic cultivation and management techniques for selected perennial crops
5. Design a small-scale perennial food system suitable for a Timorese context

Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with images and information on Timorese perennial crops
- Samples or images of local perennial crops (if available)
- Maps of Timor-Leste showing climate zones
- Large paper and colored markers for design activity
