See Activities Folder

Duration: 120 minutes

Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Define plant guilds and companion planting
2. Understand the principles of plant interactions in Timorese ecosystems
3. Identify beneficial plant combinations suitable for Timor-Leste's climate and soil conditions
4. Design a basic plant guild using local species
5. Explain the benefits of companion planting in pest management and soil health
6. Recognize traditional Timorese companion planting practices

Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with diagrams of plant guilds and companion planting examples
- Seeds or seedlings of common Timorese crops (if available)
- Pictures of local beneficial insects and pests
- Large paper and colored markers for design activity
- Samples of local plants used in companion planting (if available)

    A. Complementary nutrient needs
    B. Spatial relationships (vertical layering)
    C. Pest and disease management
    D. Soil improvement
    E. Microclimate creation

III. Common Plant Guilds and Companions in Timor-Leste (30 minutes)
    A. Staple crop guilds
       1. Corn (Batar) + Beans (Koto) + Squash (Lakeru)
       2. Cassava (Ai-farina) + Peanuts (Fore-rai) + Sweet Potato (Fehuk midar)

       1. Mango (Has) + Papaya (Aidila) + Pineapple (Ai-nanas) + Lemongrass (Duut-morin)
       2. Coconut (Nu) + Banana (Hudi) + Taro (Talas) + Ginger (Ai-lia)
    C. Vegetable companions
       1. Tomato (Tomate) + Basil (Xampu) + Marigold (Klaor)
       2. Eggplant (Brinjela) + Pigeon Pea (Tunis) + Okra (Quiabo)
    Discuss the roles and benefits of each plant in the guild/combination

IV. Benefits of Plant Guilds and Companion Planting in Timor-Leste (15 minutes)
    A. Improved water retention in dry season
    B. Enhanced soil fertility in poor soils
    C. Natural pest control (important in areas with limited access to pesticides)
    D. Increased overall productivity in small land areas
    E. Preservation of biodiversity and traditional crop varieties

V. Traditional Timorese Companion Planting Practices (15 minutes)
   A. Discuss any known traditional polyculture systems
   B. Explore the use of local plants for pest control or soil improvement
   C. Encourage students to share family or community practices

VI. Hands-on Activity: Design a Plant Guild (25 minutes)
    A. Divide class into small groups
    B. Each group designs a plant guild suitable for a Timorese garden
    C. Groups present their designs, explaining plant choices and expected interactions

VII. Challenges and Considerations (10 minutes)
     A. Balancing traditional practices with new techniques
     B. Adapting to climate change impacts
     C. Market preferences for monocultures vs. polycultures
     D. Labor considerations in managing diverse plantings

VIII. Conclusion and Discussion (10 minutes)
      A. Recap key points about plant guilds and companion planting
      B. Discuss potential for scaling up these practices in Timor-Leste
      C. Address any questions from students

IX. Assignment
    Students to interview an elder or experienced farmer in their community about traditional companion planting or polyculture practices. They should prepare a short report including:
    - Description of the practice(s)
    - Reasons given for the plant combinations
    - Observed benefits or challenges
    - How these practices might be integrated with modern agricultural knowledge
