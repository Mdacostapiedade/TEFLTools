Lesson Plan: Integrating Aquaculture and Hydroponics in Timor-Leste

Duration: 120 minutes

Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Define aquaponics and explain its components (aquaculture + hydroponics)
2. Understand the potential benefits of aquaponics in Timor-Leste's context
3. Identify suitable fish species and crops for aquaponic systems in Timor-Leste
4. Describe basic design principles for small-scale aquaponic systems
5. Understand the challenges and considerations for implementing aquaponics in Timor-Leste
6. Design a simple aquaponic system suitable for a Timorese context

Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with diagrams of aquaponic systems
- Pictures or samples of local fish species and hydroponic crops
- pH testing kits and water quality test strips
- Large paper and colored markers for design activity
- If possible, a small working model of an aquaponic system

I. Introduction (15 minutes)
   A. Define aquaponics, aquaculture, and hydroponics
   B. Explain the symbiotic relationship in aquaponic systems
   C. Briefly discuss Timor-Leste's agricultural and fisheries context

II. Components of Aquaponic Systems (20 minutes)
    A. Fish tank (aquaculture component)
    B. Filtration system
    C. Plant growing area (hydroponic component)
    D. Water and air pumps

III. Suitable Species for Timor-Leste Aquaponics (25 minutes)
    A. Fish species
       1. Tilapia (Ikan mujair)
       2. Catfish (Ikan lele)
       3. Carp (Ikan karpa)
    B. Plant species
       1. Leafy greens: Water spinach (Kanko), Lettuce (Alface), Pak choi
       2. Herbs: Basil (Xampu), Mint (Hortel√£), Coriander (Kutchae)
       3. Fruiting plants: Tomatoes (Tomate), Peppers (Ai-manas)
    Discuss characteristics and suitability of each species

IV. Benefits of Aquaponics in Timor-Leste (15 minutes)
    A. Water conservation in drought-prone areas
    B. Year-round food production
    C. Efficient use of limited space
    D. Reduced reliance on soil quality
    E. Potential for urban and peri-urban agriculture
    F. Diversification of diet and income

V. Basic Design Principles (20 minutes)
   A. System sizing and ratios (fish to plants)
   B. Water quality management
   C. Aeration and circulation
   D. Temperature control in Timor-Leste's climate
   E. Discuss potential for integrating local materials and techniques

VI. Hands-on Activity: Design an Aquaponic System (25 minutes)
    A. Divide class into small groups
    B. Each group designs a small-scale aquaponic system suitable for a Timorese family or community
    C. Groups present their designs, explaining species choices and system layout

VII. Challenges and Considerations (10 minutes)
     A. Initial setup costs and technical knowledge required
     B. Consistent electricity supply for pumps
     C. Balancing pH and nutrients in the system
     D. Fish feed sourcing and potential for local alternatives
     E. Market acceptance of aquaponic produce

VIII. Conclusion and Discussion (10 minutes)
      A. Recap key points about aquaponics in Timor-Leste
      B. Discuss potential for scaling up aquaponics in the country
      C. Address any questions from students

IX. Assignment
    Students to research and present on a potential integration of aquaponics with traditional Timorese farming or fishing practices. The presentation should include:
    - Description of the integrated system
    - How it combines modern aquaponics with traditional practices
    - Potential benefits and challenges
    - Ideas for implementing on a small scale in their community
