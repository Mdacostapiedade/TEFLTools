   B. Preventive measures
      1. Rotational grazing for parasite control
      2. Basic hygiene and hoof care
   C. Traditional Timorese remedies for goat ailments
   D. When to seek veterinary help

VI. Goat Products and Marketing (10 minutes)

    B. Potential for dairy goat development
    C. Use of goat manure in crop production
    D. Goat skin and its traditional uses

VII. Environmental Considerations (10 minutes)
     A. Managing goats to prevent over

## Grammar Points:

- Use of possessive pronouns when discussing goat ownership and characteristics (e.g., "its breed," "their grazing habits," "our local goats")

- Employing relative pronouns to describe goat breeds and grazing systems (e.g., "The Timor goat, which is indigenous to the region, is well-adapted to local conditions.")

- Utilizing demonstrative pronouns to refer to specific goat breeds or grazing techniques (e.g., "This breed is known for its hardiness," "That integrated grazing system works well in hilly areas.")

- Proper use of subject and object pronouns when describing goat behavior and management practices (e.g., "They graze on various plants," "Farmers rotate them between pastures")

- Incorporating indefinite pronouns when discussing general goat-keeping practices (e.g., "Everyone should monitor their goats' health," "Somebody needs to check the fences regularly")
