IX. Assignment
    Students to conduct a waste audit of their household or school for one week. The report should include:
    - Types and quantities of waste generated
    - Current disposal methods
    - Proposals for reducing waste and implementing closed loop practices
    - Ideas for community-level waste management initiatives

## Grammar Points:

- Word Formation: Practice forming nouns, verbs, and adjectives related to waste management
  - Example: Compost (noun) → Composting (verb/gerund) → Compostable (adjective)
  - Other words: Recycle, Reduce, Reuse, Waste, Manage, Sustain

- Conditional Sentences: Use to discuss potential outcomes of waste management practices
  - Example: "If we implement composting, we will reduce organic waste in landfills."

- Passive Voice: Employ when describing waste management processes
  - Example: "Plastic bottles are collected and recycled into new products."

- Comparative and Superlative Adjectives: Use when comparing different waste management methods
  - Example: "Composting is more efficient than landfilling for organic waste."

- Imperative Mood: Utilize when giving instructions for waste reduction or recycling
  - Example: "Separate your organic waste from non-biodegradable materials."
