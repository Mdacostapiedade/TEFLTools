Natural Building Materials and Techniques
Modern Adaptations of Traditional Building Techniques in Timor-Leste

Duration: 120 minutes

Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify local natural building materials available in Timor-Leste
2. Understand traditional Timorese building methods and their relevance today
3. Describe the benefits and challenges of using natural materials in construction
4. Recognize modern adaptations of traditional building techniques
5. Design a simple structure using local natural materials

Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Samples of local natural building materials (if possible)
- Pictures of traditional and modern natural buildings in Timor-Leste
- Handouts with information on material properties
- Large paper and colored markers for design activity
- Small amounts of materials for hands-on demonstrations (clay, straw, bamboo, etc.)

I. Introduction (15 minutes)
   A. Define natural building and its importance in sustainable architecture
   B. Brief history of traditional building in Timor-Leste
   C. Relevance of natural building in modern Timorese context

II. Local Natural Building Materials in Timor-Leste (25 minutes)
    A. Earth-based materials
       1. Adobe (sun-dried mud bricks)
       2. Rammed earth
       3. Cob
    B. Plant-based materials
       1. Bamboo (au)
       2. Palm leaves (tali tahan)
       3. Coconut fiber (nu'u fulun)
    C. Stone and lime
    D. Discuss properties, availability, and traditional uses of each material

III. Traditional Timorese Building Methods (20 minutes)
     A. Uma Lulik (sacred houses) construction techniques
     B. Traditional domestic architecture
     C. Roof thatching with palm leaves
     D. Bamboo construction techniques

IV. Benefits and Challenges of Natural Building in Timor-Leste (15 minutes)
    A. Benefits
       1. Local availability and low cost
       2. Climate-appropriate (thermal mass, natural cooling)
       3. Low environmental impact
       4. Cultural continuity
    B. Challenges
       1. Durability concerns (especially in rainy season)
       2. Skill requirements
       3. Perception issues
       4. Building code compliance

V. Modern Adaptations of Traditional Techniques (20 minutes)
   A. Improved adobe and rammed earth techniques
   B. Bamboo preservation methods
   C. Combining natural materials with modern elements (e.g., concrete foundations)
   D. Case study: Successful natural building project in Timor-Leste

VI. Hands-on Activity: Design a Simple Structure (25 minutes)
    A. Divide students into groups
    B. Each group designs a small structure (e.g., garden shed, chicken coop) using local natural materials
    C. Groups present their designs, explaining material choices and construction methods

VII. Conclusion and Discussion (10 minutes)
     A. Recap key points about natural building in Timor-Leste
     B. Discuss potential for expanding natural building practices
     C. Address any questions from students

VIII. Assignment
     Students to research and document a traditional building in their community. The report should include:
     - Materials used in construction
     - Building techniques employed
     - Current condition of the building
     - Ideas for applying similar techniques in modern construction
     - Sketch or photograph of the building

## Grammar Points:

- Conditional sentences (Type 1 and 2) for discussing potential building scenarios:
  - "If we use bamboo for the structure, it will be more flexible during earthquakes."
  - "If we were to build with rammed earth, we would need to consider proper foundations."

- Passive voice for describing construction processes:
  - "Adobe bricks are made by mixing clay, sand, and straw."
  - "Traditional roofs are thatched with palm leaves."

- Comparative and superlative adjectives for discussing material properties:
  - "Bamboo is stronger than many types of wood."
  - "Rammed earth walls provide the best thermal insulation among natural materials."

- Present perfect tense for discussing traditional techniques that are still relevant:
  - "Timorese builders have used these methods for centuries."
  - "Natural building techniques have evolved to meet modern standards."

- Modal verbs for expressing possibility and necessity in construction:
  - "We might need to reinforce the adobe walls in areas with heavy rainfall."
  - "Builders should consider using treated bamboo to increase durability."
