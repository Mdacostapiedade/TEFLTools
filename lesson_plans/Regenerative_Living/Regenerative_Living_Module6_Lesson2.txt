Lesson Plan: Cob, Straw Bale, and Earthbag Construction in Timor-Leste

Resources: 
Check Readings, activities folders

Duration: 120 minutes

Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Understand the principles of cob, straw bale, and earthbag construction
2. Identify local materials in Timor-Leste suitable for these construction methods
3. Describe the benefits and challenges of each method in the Timorese context
4. Recognize appropriate applications for each technique in Timor-Leste
5. Design a simple structure using one of these methods

Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Samples of materials (clay, straw, sand, empty bags)
- Pictures of cob, straw bale, and earthbag buildings (both international and local if available)
- Handouts with step-by-step construction processes
- Large paper and colored markers for design activity
- Small amounts of materials for hands-on demonstrations

I. Introduction (15 minutes)
   A. Brief overview of cob, straw bale, and earthbag construction
   B. Relevance to Timor-Leste's climate, resources, and building needs
   C. Connection to traditional Timorese building methods

II. Cob Construction (25 minutes)
    A. Definition and composition of cob
    B. Local materials in Timor-Leste suitable for cob
       1. Clay soils (rai-mean)
       2. Sand (rai-henek)
       3. Straw or other fibrous materials (hare kain, batar kain)
    C. Basic cob mixing and building process
    D. Applications in Timor-Leste (e.g., walls, ovens, benches)
    E. Benefits and challenges in Timorese context

III. Straw Bale Construction (25 minutes)
    A. Principles of straw bale building
    B. Adapting straw bale to Timor-Leste
       1. Using rice straw (hare kain) or other local materials
       2. Addressing moisture concerns in tropical climate
    C. Basic straw bale construction process
    D. Potential applications (e.g., well-ventilated storage structures)
    E. Benefits and challenges in Timorese context

IV. Earthbag Construction (25 minutes)
    A. Concept of earthbag building
    B. Materials available in Timor-Leste
       1. Soil types suitable for filling bags
       2. Alternatives to polypropylene bags (natural fiber bags)
    C. Earthbag building process
    D. Applications in Timor-Leste (e.g., retaining walls, disaster-resistant housing)
    E. Benefits and challenges in Timorese context

V. Comparative Analysis (15 minutes)
   A. Discuss suitability of each method for different regions of Timor-Leste
   B. Compare durability in face of local challenges (earthquakes, heavy rains)
   C. Evaluate cost-effectiveness and material availability
   D. Consider cultural acceptance and aesthetic appeal

VI. Hands-on Activity: Design a Structure (25 minutes) (see activities folder)
    A. Divide students into groups
    B. Each group chooses one method (cob, straw bale, or earthbag)
    C. Groups design a small structure suitable for a Timorese community (e.g., community center, school classroom, storage facility)
    D. Groups present their designs, explaining material choices and construction process

VII. Conclusion and Discussion (10 minutes)
     A. Recap key points about each construction method
     B. Discuss potential for implementing these techniques in Timor-Leste
     C. Address any questions from students

VIII. Assignment
     Students to create a proposal for a community building project using one of these methods. The proposal should include:
     - Chosen construction method and justification
     - List of locally available materials
     - Basic design sketch
     - Consideration of local climate and environmental factors
     - Ideas for involving the community in the building process
     - Potential challenges and solutions

## Grammar Points:

- Comparative and superlative adjectives: These are useful when comparing the different construction methods (e.g., "Cob is more durable than straw bale in wet conditions," "Earthbag construction is the most earthquake-resistant of the three methods").

- Adverbs of manner: These can be used to describe how the construction processes are carried out (e.g., "Cob is mixed thoroughly before application," "Straw bales are stacked carefully to ensure stability").

- Conditional sentences: These are helpful when discussing potential applications and challenges (e.g., "If we use earthbag construction, we would need to source appropriate soil," "Were we to implement straw bale building, we might face challenges with moisture control").

- Passive voice: This is often used in describing construction processes (e.g., "The bags are filled with soil," "The cob mixture is applied to the wall").

- Adjectives for describing materials and structures: These are essential for discussing the properties of buildings and materials (e.g., "resilient structures," "pliable cob mixture," "sturdy earthbag walls").
