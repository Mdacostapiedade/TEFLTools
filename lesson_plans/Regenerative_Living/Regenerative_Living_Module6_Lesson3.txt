     D. Environmental benefits (reduced carbon emissions, preservation of resources)

VIII. Conclusion and Discussion (10 minutes)
      A. Recap key points about passive solar design and energy efficiency in Timor-Leste
      B. Discuss potential for implementing these strategies in new and existing buildings
      C. Address any questions from students

IX. Assignment
    Students to conduct an energy audit of their home or school, identifying areas for improvement. The report should include:
    - Current energy use patterns
    - Identification of energy-inefficient features
    - Proposals for implementing passive solar and energy efficiency strategies
    - Estimated benefits (comfort improvement, potential energy savings)

## Grammar Points:

- Conditional sentences: Use "if" clauses to discuss potential energy savings and design improvements. For example, "If we implement passive solar design, we can reduce energy consumption."

- Comparative and superlative adjectives: Employ these to compare different materials and techniques. For instance, "Bamboo is more sustainable than concrete" or "Adobe has the best thermal properties among local materials."

- Passive voice: Utilize passive constructions to describe processes and design features. For example, "The building is oriented to maximize natural ventilation" or "Solar energy is harnessed through strategic window placement."

- Imperative mood: Use imperative sentences to give instructions during the hands-on activity. For instance, "Design the roof overhang to provide adequate shading" or "Incorporate cross-ventilation in your layout."

- Present perfect tense: Apply this tense to discuss recent developments or ongoing practices in energy-efficient design. For example, "Timor-Leste has adopted several traditional building techniques for modern construction" or "Architects have been integrating passive solar principles into their designs."
