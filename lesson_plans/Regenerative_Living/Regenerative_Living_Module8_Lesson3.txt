   Students to research or interview local community leaders about existing resource sharing practices. The report should include:

   - Analysis of their effectiveness and challenges
   - Suggestions for enhancing or scaling up these practices
   - Ideas for new resource sharing initiatives that could benefit the community
   - Reflection on how these practices contribute to economic resilience

## Grammar Points:

- Use of conditional sentences (e.g., "If we implement this resource sharing strategy, then...") to discuss potential outcomes and scenarios in economic resilience planning.

- Proper use of commas in lists when describing various resource sharing practices, economic models, and community initiatives (e.g., "Traditional resource sharing includes customary land management, communal labor practices, and bartering systems.").

- Correct use of semicolons to connect closely related independent clauses when discussing complex economic concepts (e.g., "Local resource sharing strengthens communities; it also promotes economic resilience.").

- Appropriate use of hyphens in compound adjectives related to economic terms (e.g., "community-based natural resource management," "small-scale enterprises").

- Correct capitalization of proper nouns specific to Timor-Leste and local practices (e.g., "Tara bandu," "Hakbit malu") to emphasize cultural context and respect for traditional systems.
