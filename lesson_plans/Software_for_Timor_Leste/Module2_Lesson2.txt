- Final project: Comprehensive data analysis of a Timor-Leste-related dataset

### Final Project Guidelines:
1. Choose a dataset related to Timor-Leste (e.g., economic indicators, health statistics, education data)
2. Perform a comprehensive analysis using spreadsheet tools, including:
   - Data cleaning and formatting
   - Basic and advanced functions
   - Sorting and filtering
   - Pivot tables
   - Charts and graphs
3. Create a dashboard summarizing key findings
4. Write a brief report interpreting the results and providing insights
5. Present your analysis to the class, explaining your methodology and conclusions

### Additional Resources:
- Online spreadsheet tutorials
- Timor-Leste government statistical websites
- International organizations' databases (World Bank, UN)

## Grammar Points:

- Comparative and superlative adjectives: These are essential when discussing data trends and comparing values (e.g., "higher population growth," "the most populous district," "least developed regions").

- Adverbs of frequency: Useful for describing data patterns and occurrences (e.g., "frequently updated statistics," "rarely observed phenomena," "consistently increasing values").

- Quantifiers: Important for discussing data quantities and proportions (e.g., "many districts," "few instances," "some indicators," "all datasets").

- Present perfect tense: Helpful when discussing ongoing trends or changes in data (e.g., "The population has increased by 10% since 2010," "Literacy rates have improved significantly").

- Conditional sentences: Useful for discussing hypothetical scenarios or potential outcomes based on data analysis (e.g., "If the economic growth continues at this rate, then...," "Should the data indicate a decline, we would need to...").
