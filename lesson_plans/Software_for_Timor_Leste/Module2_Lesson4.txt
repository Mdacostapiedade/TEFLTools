#### Activities:
1. (20 min) Introduction to regular expressions: definition, uses, and importance
2. (30 min) Basic regex syntax: literal characters, metacharacters (., *, +, ?)
3. (40 min) Hands-on practice: matching simple patterns
4. (25 min) Introduction to Python's re module
5. (5 min) Q&A and wrap-up

#### Homework:

### Session 2: Character Classes and Quantifiers

#### Objectives:
- Understand and use character classes
- Learn about quantifiers and their applications

#### Activities:
1. (20 min) Review of previous session and homework
2. (30 min) Character classes: [abc], [^abc], \d, \w, \s and their negations
3. (30 min) Quantifiers: *, +, ?, {n}, {n,}, {n,m}
4. (35 min) Hands-on practice: using character classes and quantifiers
5. (5 min) Q&A and wrap-up

#### Homework:
Create regex patterns to validate Timor-Leste postal codes and vehicle registration numbers

### Session 3: Anchors, Groups, and Backreferences

#### Objectives:
- Learn about regex anchors
- Understand grouping and backreferences

#### Activities:
1. (20 min) Review of previous session and homework
2. (25 min) Anchors: ^, $, \b
3. (35 min) Grouping with parentheses () and backreferences
4. (35 min) Hands-on practice: using anchors, groups, and backreferences
5. (5 min) Q&A and wrap-up

#### Homework:
Write a regex to extract dates from a text, considering various date formats used in Timor-Leste

### Session 4: Regex in Python: Search and Match

#### Objectives:
- Use re.search() and re.match() functions
- Understand the difference between search and match

#### Activities:
1. (20 min) Review of previous session and homework
2. (30 min) re.search() function: syntax and usage
3. (30 min) re.match() function: syntax and usage
4. (35 min) Hands-on practice: searching and matching patterns in Python strings
5. (5 min) Q&A and wrap-up

#### Homework:
Write a Python script that searches for and extracts all mentions of Timorese cities from a given text

### Session 5: Regex in Python: Findall, Sub, and Compile

#### Objectives:
- Learn to use re.findall() and re.sub() functions
- Understand the benefits of re.compile()

#### Activities:
1. (20 min) Review of previous session and homework
2. (25 min) re.findall() function: finding all occurrences of a pattern
3. (25 min) re.sub() function: search and replace using regex
4. (20 min) re.compile(): precompiling regex patterns
5. (25 min) Hands-on practice: using findall, sub, and compile in Python scripts
6. (5 min) Final Q&A and module wrap-up

#### Homework:
Create a Python script that processes a text about Timor-Leste, replacing all mentions of dates with a standardized format

### Assessment:
- Daily homework assignments
- In-class participation and hands-on exercises
- Final project: Develop a Python program that uses regex to extract and analyze data from a Timor-Leste census report or similar document

### Additional Resources:
- Online regex testers and visualizers
- Python's re module documentation
- Cheat sheets for regex syntax

### Final Project Guidelines:
1. Choose a text document relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., census report, news articles, government documents)
2. Develop regex patterns to extract specific information (e.g., dates, names, statistics)
3. Create a Python script that:
   - Reads the document
   - Applies the regex patterns to extract information
   - Processes and analyzes the extracted data
   - Outputs the results in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON)
4. Write a brief report explaining your regex patterns and the insights gained from the data analysis
