### Assessment:
- Daily homework assignments
- In-class participation and hands-on exercises
- Final project: Data analysis and visualization using R

### Final Project Guidelines:
1. Choose a dataset related to Timor-Leste (e.g., education statistics, health indicators, economic data)
2. Perform a comprehensive analysis using R, including:
   - Data import and cleaning
   - Exploratory data analysis
   - Statistical analysis (as appropriate for the dataset)
   - Data visualization
3. Create an R Markdown document presenting your analysis, including code and results
4. Write a brief report interpreting your findings and their implications for Timor-Leste
5. Present your project to the class, explaining your methodology and conclusions

### Additional Resources:
- R documentation (https://www.r-project.org/)
- R Studio resources and cheat sheets
- Online R tutorials and courses
- R for Data Science book (available online)

Here's a Grammar Points section for the R and R Studio lesson plan, focusing on relevant tenses and language structures:

## Grammar Points:

- Present Simple tense for describing R and its features:
  - Example: "R is a programming language used for statistical computing and graphics."

- Imperative mood for giving instructions in R:
  - Example: "Create a vector by using the c() function."

- Present Continuous tense for describing ongoing processes in data analysis:
  - Example: "The script is currently importing the dataset from the CSV file."

- Present Perfect tense for discussing completed actions with current relevance:
  - Example: "We have created a data frame containing information about Timor-Leste's districts."

- Future Simple tense for describing upcoming tasks or expected results:
  - Example: "In the next session, we will learn how to visualize data using R's plotting functions."
