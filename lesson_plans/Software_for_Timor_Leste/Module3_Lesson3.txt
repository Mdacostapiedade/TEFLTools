### Session 2: Choosing the Right Chart Type

#### Objectives:
- Understand different types of charts and their uses
- Learn to select appropriate chart types for different data and goals

#### Activities:
1. (20 min) Review of previous session and homework

#### Activities:
1. (20 min) Review of previous session and homework
2. (30 min) Color theory basics: color wheel, harmony, contrast
3. (30 min) Color in data visualization: encoding data, accessibility considerations
4. (35 min) Hands-on practice: Applying color effectively to visualizations
5. (5 min) Q&A and wrap-up

#### Homework:
Recreate a black and white chart about Timor-Leste using an effective color scheme

### Session 4: Designing for Different Audiences and Purposes

#### Objectives:
- Understand how audience and purpose affect visualization design
- Learn to tailor visualizations for different contexts

#### Activities:
1. (20 min) Review of previous session and homework
2. (30 min) Audience considerations: technical vs. non-technical, cultural factors
3. (30 min) Purpose-driven design: exploratory vs. explanatory visualizations
4. (35 min) Hands-on practice: Adapting a visualization for different audiences
5. (5 min) Q&A and wrap-up

#### Homework:
Create two versions of the same data visualization about Timor-Leste's education system: one for policymakers and one for the general public

### Session 5: Interactive and Dynamic Visualizations

#### Objectives:
- Understand the benefits and challenges of interactive visualizations
- Learn basic techniques for creating interactive charts

#### Activities:
1. (20 min) Review of previous session and homework
2. (30 min) Introduction to interactive visualizations: benefits and best practices
3. (40 min) Demonstration of interactive visualization techniques
4. (25 min) Hands-on practice: Adding interactivity to a static chart
5. (5 min) Final Q&A and module wrap-up

#### Homework:
Create an interactive dashboard visualizing key development indicators for Timor-Leste

### Assessment:
- Daily homework assignments
- In-class participation and hands-on exercises
- Final project: Comprehensive data visualization project

### Final Project Guidelines:
1. Choose a complex dataset related to Timor-Leste (e.g., multi-year development indicators)
2. Create a set of visualizations that tell a cohesive story about the data, including:
   - At least three different chart types
   - Appropriate use of color and design principles
   - At least one interactive element
3. Write a report explaining your visualization choices and the insights gained
4. Create versions for two different audiences (e.g., government officials and local community leaders)
5. Present your project to the class, explaining your design decisions and key findings

### Additional Resources:
- Books: "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" by Edward Tufte, "Storytelling with Data" by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic
- Online resources: Data Visualization Catalogue, Flowing Data blog
- Tools: R (ggplot2), Tableau Public, D3.js

## Grammar Points:

- Conditional sentences (If-clauses): Used to discuss hypothetical scenarios in data visualization, e.g., "If we use a bar chart, it would be easier to compare values across categories."

- Comparative and superlative adjectives: Employed when discussing different chart types and their effectiveness, e.g., "Line charts are more suitable for showing trends over time than pie charts."

- Modal verbs for suggestions and recommendations: Utilized when advising on best practices, e.g., "You should consider using a heatmap to display correlation between multiple variables."

- Present perfect tense: Applied when discussing experience or completed actions related to data visualization, e.g., "We have created several interactive dashboards for different audiences."

- Passive voice: Used to describe processes and techniques in data visualization, e.g., "The data is transformed into visual elements that can be easily interpreted by the audience."
