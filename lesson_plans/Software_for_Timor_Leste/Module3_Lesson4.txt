Read Data Analytics and Metrics in Readings

## Grammar Points:

- Use of pronouns to refer to data sets and metrics (e.g., "it," "they," "them") to avoid repetition and improve clarity in discussions about analytics
- Subject-verb agreement when discussing singular or plural data points (e.g., "The data shows..." vs. "The data show...")
- Proper use of comparative and superlative adjectives when describing metrics and trends (e.g., "higher," "lower," "most significant")
- Correct application of prepositions in phrases related to data analysis (e.g., "increase in," "decrease of," "correlation between")
- Use of passive voice to emphasize the data or process rather than the analyst (e.g., "The results were analyzed" instead of "We analyzed the results")
