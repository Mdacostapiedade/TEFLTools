#### Activities:
1. (20 min) Review of previous session and homework
2. (30 min) Error handling in Python: try-except blocks, raising exceptions
3. (30 min) Debugging techniques: print statements, debugger tools
4. (35 min) Hands-on practice: Debugging a faulty program that calculates Timor-Leste's GDP growth
5. (5 min) Final Q&A and module wrap-up

#### Homework:
Improve a given Python program by adding error handling and fixing bugs

### Assessment:
- Daily homework assignments
- In-class participation and hands-on exercises
- Final project: Comprehensive problem-solving challenge

### Final Project Guidelines:
1. Choose a complex problem relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., optimizing water distribution in rural areas)
2. Apply the problem-solving techniques learned in class:
   - Break down the problem into smaller parts
   - Choose appropriate data structures
   - Develop algorithms for each part
   - Implement the solution in Python
   - Include error handling and debugging
3. Write a report explaining your problem-solving approach and implementation
4. Present your project to the class, demonstrating your solution and explaining your thought process

### Additional Resources:
- Book: "Think Python" by Allen B. Downey
- Online platforms: Codecademy, HackerRank for Python practice
- Python documentation
- Real-world datasets from Timor-Leste government websites or international organizations
