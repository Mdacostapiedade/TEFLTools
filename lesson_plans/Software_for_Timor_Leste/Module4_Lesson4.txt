# Lesson Plan: Building a Bitcoin Price Checker

## Duration: 1 day (3 hours)

### Objectives:
- Understand how to interact with cryptocurrency APIs
- Learn to parse JSON data in Python
- Build a simple program to check and display Bitcoin prices
- Implement basic error handling in API requests

### Materials:
- Computers with Python installed
- Internet access
- Access to a cryptocurrency price API (e.g., CoinGecko)

### Session Outline:

1. Introduction to APIs and JSON (30 minutes)
   a. What are APIs?
   b. Introduction to JSON format
   c. Overview of cryptocurrency price APIs

2. Setting Up the Development Environment (30 minutes)
   a. Installing necessary Python libraries (requests)
   b. Obtaining API access (if required)

3. Making API Requests in Python (45 minutes)
   a. Using the requests library
   b. Sending GET requests to the API
   c. Handling API responses

4. Break (15 minutes)

5. Parsing JSON Data (30 minutes)
   a. Converting JSON to Python objects
   b. Extracting relevant price information

6. Building the Bitcoin Price Checker (45 minutes)
   a. Writing the main function to fetch and display prices
   b. Implementing basic error handling
   c. Adding user input for currency selection

7. Testing and Refinement (15 minutes)
   a. Testing the program with different inputs
   b. Discussing potential improvements

8. Wrap-up and Q&A (15 minutes)
   - Discussing real-world applications of the price checker
   - Exploring ideas for extending the program

### Homework:
Extend the Bitcoin price checker to include additional cryptocurrencies and display price changes over 24 hours.

### Assessment:
- Completion of the Bitcoin price checker program
- Quality of code and error handling
- Homework assignment

### Additional Resources:
- Python requests library documentation
- CoinGecko API documentation
- "Python for Finance" by Yves Hilpisch (for more advanced financial applications)

Here's a Grammar Points section for the Bitcoin Price Checker lesson plan, emphasizing the use of Nouns and Articles:

## Grammar Points:

- The use of definite articles ("the") with specific APIs or technologies:
  - Example: "the CoinGecko API" or "the requests library"

- The use of indefinite articles ("a" or "an") when introducing new concepts:
  - Example: "a cryptocurrency price API" or "an API request"

- Proper nouns in the context of programming and cryptocurrencies:
  - Examples: "Python," "Bitcoin," "JSON," "GET request"

- Collective nouns when referring to data or groups of information:
  - Examples: "price information," "JSON data," "API responses"

- Countable vs. uncountable nouns in programming contexts:
  - Countable: "libraries," "functions," "requests"
  - Uncountable: "code," "data," "information"
