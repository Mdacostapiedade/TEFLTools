# Module 5: Databases and SQL
## Lesson 1: Introduction to Relational Databases

**Duration:** 90 minutes

### Lesson Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Define what a database and a Database Management System (DBMS) are
2. Explain the concept of a relational database
3. Identify the components of a relational database (tables, rows, columns)
4. Understand the concept of keys (primary and foreign)
5. Create a simple Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram

### Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Computer with projector
- Handouts with example database tables
- Recommended textbook: "PostgresSQL 10 Administrator's Cookbook"

### Lesson Plan:

1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**
   - Welcome students to the Databases and SQL module
   - Briefly outline the importance of databases in software development
   - Introduce the objectives for this lesson

2. **What is a Database? (15 minutes)**
   - Define a database: "A collection of persistent data"
   - Explain DBMS: "Software system that supports creation, population, and querying of a database"
   - Discuss real-world examples of databases (e.g., library catalog, online store inventory)
   - Class discussion: Ask students to share examples of databases they encounter in daily life

3. **Introduction to Relational Databases (20 minutes)**
   - Define a relational database: "A database that organizes data into tables with relationships between them"
   - Explain key components:
     - Tables (relations)
     - Rows (tuples)
     - Columns (attributes)
   - Show an example table on the whiteboard (e.g., Students table from the provided content)
   - Discuss the concept of schema: "The structure that defines the organization of data in a database"

4. **Keys in Relational Databases (20 minutes)**
   - Introduce the concept of keys
   - Explain Primary Key: "A minimal subset of fields that uniquely identifies a row in a table"
   - Discuss Foreign Key: "A field (or set of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table"
   - Provide examples of primary and foreign keys using the Students and Courses tables from the document

5. **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams (15 minutes)**
   - Introduce ER diagrams as a way to visualize database structure
   - Demonstrate how to create a simple ER diagram using the Students and Courses tables
   - Show how to represent relationships (e.g., many-to-many relationship between Students and Courses)

6. **Hands-on Activity (10 minutes)**
   - Divide students into small groups
   - Provide a scenario (e.g., a small library system) and ask them to:
     - Identify entities (tables)
     - Define attributes for each entity
     - Determine primary keys
     - Identify relationships between entities
   - Ask groups to sketch a simple ER diagram for their system

7. **Conclusion and Preview (5 minutes)**
   - Recap the main points of the lesson
   - Preview the next lesson: "Working with SQL"
   - Assign reading from "PostgresSQL 10 Administrator's Cookbook" (relevant chapters on database basics)

### Assessment:
- Participation in class discussions
- Quality of ER diagrams created during the hands-on activity
- Short quiz at the beginning of the next lesson to review key concepts

### Homework:
1. Read assigned chapters from the textbook
2. Create an ER diagram for a simple system of their choice (e.g., a music streaming service, a social media platform)
3. Write a short paragraph explaining the entities, attributes, and relationships in their diagram

## Grammar Points:

- Passive Voice: Used frequently when describing database operations and structures. For example:
  - "Data is organized into tables."
  - "Relationships are established between tables."
  - "Primary keys are used to uniquely identify rows."

- Noun Phrases: Important for naming and describing database components. Examples:
  - "Relational database"
  - "Entity-Relationship diagram"
  - "Database Management System"

- Conditional Sentences: Useful when explaining database concepts and relationships. For instance:
  - "If a field is a foreign key, it refers to a primary key in another table."
  - "When a many-to-many relationship exists, a junction table is often created."

- Technical Vocabulary: Emphasize the correct use of specific terms in context:
  - "Tables" instead of "spreadsheets"
  - "Rows" and "columns" instead of "cells"
  - "Queries" instead of "questions"

- Prepositional Phrases: Often used to describe relationships and locations within a database:
  - "Data in tables"
  - "Relationships between entities"
  - "Keys within a table"
