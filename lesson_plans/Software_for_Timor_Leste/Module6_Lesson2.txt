Lesson Plan: Services, Daemons, and Scheduled Tasks in CentOS

Duration: 90 minutes

Lesson Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain the concepts of services and daemons in Linux
2. Manage services using systemctl commands
3. Configure and manage scheduled tasks using cron

Materials:
- CentOS Linux computers or virtual machines for each student
- Projector/screen for demonstrations
- Handout with key systemctl and cron commands

Lesson Outline:

I. Introduction (10 minutes)
   - Define services and daemons
   - Explain their role in a Linux system

II. Managing Services with systemd (30 minutes)
   - Introduction to systemd and systemctl
   - Key systemctl commands:
     - systemctl status <service>
     - systemctl start/stop/restart <service>
     - systemctl enable/disable <service>
   - Demonstration and hands-on practice with common services (e.g., sshd, httpd)

III. Viewing System Logs (15 minutes)
   - Using journalctl to view system logs
   - Filtering logs by service

IV. Scheduled Tasks with cron (25 minutes)
   - Introduction to cron and crontab
   - Crontab syntax
   - Editing crontab with crontab -e
   - Creating and managing scheduled tasks
   - Demonstration and hands-on practice

V. Practice Exercise (15 minutes)
   - Students complete a series of tasks involving service management and cron job creation

VI. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)
   - Recap key points
   - Address any questions

Key Commands to Cover:
(Based on the CentOS cheat sheet provided)

1. systemctl start/stop/restart <service>
2. systemctl enable/disable <service>
3. systemctl status <service>
4. service (for legacy SysV init scripts)
5. chkconfig (for legacy SysV init service management)
6. cron
7. crontab -e (to edit user's crontab)
8. systemctl list-unit-files (to list all available services)

Assessment:
- Observation of student practice during hands-on sections
- Completion of practice exercise
- Short quiz on key concepts and commands at the start of next lesson

Homework:
- Research and write a brief report on three essential Linux services and their functions
- Create a cron job that runs a simple script (e.g., date logging) every hour

This lesson provides practical experience with managing services and scheduling tasks in CentOS, building on the Linux basics from the previous lesson. It emphasizes hands-on practice with real-world administrative tasks.
