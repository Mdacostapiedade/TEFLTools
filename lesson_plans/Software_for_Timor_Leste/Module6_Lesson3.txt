Duration: 120 minutes

### Lesson Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Understand the basics of Bash scripting
2. Create and execute simple Bash scripts
3. Use variables, control structures, and loops in Bash scripts
4. Implement basic error handling and debugging techniques

### Materials:
- CentOS Linux computers or virtual machines for each student
- Projector/screen for demonstrations
- Text editor (e.g., nano, vim)
- Handout with Bash scripting syntax reference

### Lesson Outline:

I. Introduction to Bash Scripting (15 minutes)

   - Demonstration and practice

III. Variables and Input (25 minutes)
   - Declaring and using variables
   - Command substitution
   - User input (read command)
   - Special variables ($1, $2, $#, $@)
   - Hands-on exercises

IV. Control Structures (30 minutes)
   - If-else statements
   - Case statements
   - For loops
   - While loops

   - Return values
   - Basic error handling (exit codes, ||, &&)
   - Debugging techniques (set -x)

VI. Practice Exercise (15 minutes)
   - Students write a script that incorporates variables, control structures, and functions

VII. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)
   - Recap key points
   - Address any questions

### Key Concepts and Commands to Cover:
1. Script creation and execution
2. Variables and command substitution
3. Control structures (if, case, for, while)
4. Functions
5. Error handling and debugging

### Assessment:
- Observation of student practice during hands-on sections
- Completion of the final practice exercise
- Code review of student-written scripts

### Homework:
- Write a Bash script that performs a system maintenance task (e.g., log rotation, disk space check)
- Modify an existing script to add error handling and user input validation

### Additional Resources:
- Bash manual (man bash)
- Online Bash scripting tutorials
- Sample scripts for common system administration tasks
