# Module 6: Linux and Networking Essentials
## Lesson 4: Networking Fundamentals

Duration: 120 minutes

### Lesson Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Understand the OSI model and its layers
2. Explain the difference between Layer 2 and Layer 3 networking
3. Describe basic networking concepts like IP addressing, subnetting, and VLANs
4. Use common Linux networking tools for troubleshooting

### Materials:
- Linux computers or virtual machines for each student
- Projector/screen for demonstrations
- Handout with networking terminology and commands

### Lesson Outline:

I. Introduction to Networking Models (20 minutes)
   - The OSI Model: 7 layers and their functions
   - TCP/IP Model: How it relates to OSI
   - Focus on Layer 2 (Data Link) and Layer 3 (Network)

II. Layer 2 Networking Concepts (25 minutes)
   - MAC addresses
   - Ethernet frames
   - Switches and bridging
   - VLANs: Purpose and basic configuration
   - Demonstration: Using 'ip link' to view and configure interfaces

III. Layer 3 Networking Concepts (30 minutes)
   - IP addressing (IPv4 and brief intro to IPv6)
   - Subnetting basics
   - Routing concepts
   - NAT and PAT
   - Demonstration: Using 'ip addr' and 'ip route' commands

IV. Common Networking Protocols (15 minutes)
   - ARP
   - DHCP
   - DNS
   - Brief overview of TCP vs UDP

V. Linux Networking Tools (25 minutes)
   - ping: Testing connectivity
   - traceroute: Tracing the path of packets
   - netstat: Viewing network connections
   - ss: Another tool for investigating sockets
   - tcpdump: Capturing and analyzing network traffic
   - Hands-on practice with these tools

VI. Practice Exercise (10 minutes)
   - Students use various networking tools to diagnose a simulated network issue

VII. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)
   - Recap key points
   - Address any questions

### Key Concepts and Commands to Cover:
1. OSI and TCP/IP models
2. MAC addresses vs IP addresses
3. Subnetting
4. VLANs
5. ARP, DHCP, DNS
6. ip link, ip addr, ip route commands
7. ping, traceroute, netstat, ss, tcpdump

### Assessment:
- Observation of student practice during hands-on sections
- Completion of the network diagnosis exercise
- Short quiz on key networking concepts at the start of next lesson

### Homework:
- Research and write a brief report on how NAT works and its importance in IPv4 networking
- Practice subnetting: provide a set of IP addressing problems for students to solve

### Additional Resources:
- Online subnet calculator
- Wireshark for deeper packet analysis (if time permits in future lessons)
