# Module 7, Lesson 2: Container Orchestration with Kubernetes

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of container orchestration
2. Explain the basic architecture of Kubernetes
3. Describe key Kubernetes objects and their functions
4. Deploy a simple application using Kubernetes

## Duration
3 hours

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of containerization and Docker
- Familiarity with YAML

## Materials
- Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud-based)
- kubectl CLI tool
- Sample application containerized with Docker

## Lesson Outline

### 1. Introduction to Container Orchestration (30 minutes)
- Definition and need for container orchestration
- Benefits of using container orchestration
- Overview of popular orchestration tools
- Introduction to Kubernetes

### 2. Kubernetes Architecture (45 minutes)
- Control plane components (API server, etcd, scheduler, controller manager)
- Node components (kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime)
- Kubernetes cluster structure (master and worker nodes)
- High-level overview of how Kubernetes works

### 3. Key Kubernetes Objects (60 minutes)
- Pods
- ReplicaSets
- Deployments
- Services
- ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Volumes and Persistent Volumes
- Namespaces

### 4. Hands-on: Deploying an Application with Kubernetes (45 minutes)
- Writing Kubernetes YAML manifests
- Using kubectl to create and manage resources
- Deploying a sample application
- Scaling the application
- Exposing the application using a Service

## Activities

### Activity 1: Kubernetes Object Matching Game (15 minutes)
- Provide students with a list of Kubernetes objects and their descriptions
- Ask them to match the objects with their correct descriptions
- Discuss the answers as a group

### Activity 2: Deploying a Sample Application (30 minutes)
- Provide students with a pre-containerized application
- Guide them through creating necessary Kubernetes YAML manifests
- Have students deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster
- Demonstrate how to scale the application and expose it using a Service

## Assessment
- Quiz on Kubernetes concepts and architecture (15 minutes)
- Practical exercise: Deploy and scale a given application using Kubernetes (homework)

## Additional Resources
- Kubernetes official documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/
- "Kubernetes: Up and Running" book by Kelsey Hightower
- Kubernetes the Hard Way: https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way

## Homework
1. Complete the practical exercise of deploying and scaling an application
2. Read the Kubernetes networking and service discovery concepts
3. Prepare questions for the next lesson on advanced Kubernetes topics

## Next Lesson Preview
In the next lesson, we will dive deeper into Kubernetes networking, service discovery, and explore more advanced concepts like Ingress and StatefulSets.
