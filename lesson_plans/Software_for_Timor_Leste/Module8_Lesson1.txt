Here's a Grammar Points section for the lesson plan, focusing on relevant grammar points and emphasizing the use of Modal Verbs in the context of this lesson:

## Grammar Points:

1. Modal Verbs for Possibility and Prediction:
   - Use "can" and "could" to discuss the capabilities of generative AI models
   - Example: "Generative AI models can create realistic images from text descriptions."
   - Use "may" and "might" to speculate about future developments in the field
   - Example: "In the future, generative AI might revolutionize drug discovery processes."

2. Passive Voice for Describing Processes:
   - Use passive constructions to explain how generative AI models are trained and used
   - Example: "Large language models are trained on vast amounts of text data."

3. Comparative and Superlative Forms:
   - Use comparatives to contrast generative AI with traditional AI approaches
   - Example: "Generative models are more versatile than discriminative models in certain tasks."
   - Use superlatives to highlight the most advanced or impactful aspects of generative AI
   - Example: "GPT-3 is one of the largest language models ever created."

4. Conditional Sentences for Ethical Considerations:
   - Use first and second conditional structures to discuss potential impacts and ethical issues
   - Example: "If generative AI is misused, it could lead to the spread of misinformation."
   - Example: "What would happen if everyone had access to powerful generative AI tools?"

5. Present Perfect for Recent Developments:
   - Use the present perfect tense to describe recent advancements in generative AI
   - Example: "Researchers have made significant breakthroughs in generative AI over the past few years."
