### Activities

#### Activity 1: AI-Assisted Code Generation Challenge (20 minutes)
- Divide students into pairs
- Provide each pair with a set of coding tasks (e.g., implement a sorting algorithm, create a REST API endpoint)
- Challenge students to use AI assistants to generate initial code and then collaborate to refine and improve it
- Compare and discuss different approaches and results

#### Activity 2: AI Debugging Relay (25 minutes)
- Create groups of 3-4 students
- Provide each group with a complex bug in a code sample
- Students take turns using AI assistance to identify and fix parts of the bug
- Groups present their debugging process and final solution to the class

### Assessment
- Quiz on AI code assistance concepts and best practices (15 minutes)
- Practical assignment: Solve a coding problem using AI assistance, documenting the process and critically evaluating the AI's contributions (homework)

### Additional Resources
- "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas (chapter on code generation)
- GitHub Copilot documentation and best practices
- "AI-Assisted Software Engineering: Survey and Future Directions" research paper

### Homework
1. Complete the practical assignment of solving a coding problem with AI assistance
2. Write a short reflection (500 words) on the benefits and challenges of using AI for coding, based on personal experience
3. Explore an AI code assistant not covered in class and prepare a brief presentation on its unique features

### Next Lesson Preview
In the next lesson, we will explore advanced applications of AI in software development, including automated testing, code review, and predictive maintenance.
