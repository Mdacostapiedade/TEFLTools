- Have groups use Python to analyze the data and present their findings

#### Activity 2: Custom Map Creation (20 minutes)
- Individual exercise
- Students create a custom map of their choice using provided datasets
- Encourage creativity in map design and data representation

### Assessment
- Quiz on geospatial concepts and Python libraries (15 minutes)
- Practical assignment: Solve a geospatial problem using Python, documenting the process and results (homework)

### Additional Resources
- "Python Geospatial Development" by Erik Westra
- GeoPandas documentation: https://geopandas.org/
