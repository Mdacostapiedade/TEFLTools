## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barrier**: Ensure all key terms are translated into Tetum. Use visual aids extensively and encourage students to create their own visual representations of concepts.

2. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Be respectful of local healing traditions. Frame TCM as a complementary approach rather than a replacement for existing practices.

3. **Skepticism**: Provide scientific explanations where possible, but also acknowledge the long history and widespread use of TCM. Encourage students to approach the material with an open mind.

4. **Difficulty Locating Acupoints**: Spend extra time on hands-on practice. Consider using acupoint models or having students work in pairs to give each other feedback.

5. **Connecting TCM to Local Practices**: Encourage students to share their knowledge of local healing methods. Facilitate discussions on how TCM concepts might align with or differ from these practices.

6. **Limited Resources**: If technology is unavailable, focus on hands-on activities and group discussions. Create large, reusable visual aids that can be displayed in the classroom.

7. **Varying Levels of Prior Knowledge**: Conduct a brief pre-assessment to gauge students' familiarity with the topic. Be prepared to provide additional background information or more advanced content as needed.
