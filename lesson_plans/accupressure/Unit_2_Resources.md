# Discussion Questions

1. How do traditional Timorese practices for managing pregnancy discomforts compare to the acupressure techniques we've learned?

2. What challenges might you face when introducing acupressure to pregnant women in your community? How could you address these challenges?

3. How might acupressure complement existing prenatal care practices in Timor-Leste?

4. What are some cultural considerations to keep in mind when teaching or practicing acupressure in Timor-Leste?

5. How could you integrate acupressure education into existing maternal health programs or prenatal classes?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a short informational pamphlet (200-300 words) in simple language explaining the benefits and basic techniques of acupressure for pregnancy. Consider your audience to be pregnant women in rural Timor-Leste who may have limited literacy. Include simple illustrations if possible.

# Assignment Details

1. Practice Journal:
   - Over the next week, practice locating and stimulating the 5 key acupressure points learned in class.
   - Keep a daily journal noting:
     * Which points you practiced
     * Any challenges in locating the points
     * Any effects or sensations you observed
     * Questions that arose during practice

2. Research Task:
   - Choose one additional acupressure point beneficial for pregnancy that was not covered in class.
   - Research its location, benefits, and any safety considerations.
   - Prepare a short (2-3 minute) presentation to share with the class next week, including:
     * The point's name and location
     * Its benefits for pregnant women
     * How to locate and stimulate the point
     * Any safety considerations or contraindications

## Illustrated Handout: Key Acupressure Points for Pregnancy

[Note: This would be a visual guide with clear illustrations of the human body showing the exact locations of P6, GB21, LI4, SP6, and KD1, with brief descriptions in Tetum. As I cannot generate images, please imagine a professionally designed handout with clear, labeled diagrams.]
