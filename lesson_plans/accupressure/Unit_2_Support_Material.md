## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barrier**: 
   - Use visual aids extensively
   - Employ a local translator if needed
   - Encourage participants to demonstrate understanding through actions rather than just verbal responses

2. **Cultural Sensitivity**:
   - Begin the lesson by acknowledging and respecting local traditional practices
   - Frame acupressure as a complementary technique, not a replacement for existing care
   - Invite participants to share how these techniques might integrate with their cultural beliefs

3. **Varying Levels of Anatomical Knowledge**:
   - Start with basic anatomy lessons if needed
   - Use simple landmarks and relatable descriptions to locate points
   - Provide plenty of hands-on practice time

4. **Concerns About Safety**:
   - Emphasize safety guidelines throughout the lesson
   - Provide clear, written contraindications
   - Demonstrate proper pressure techniques to avoid overstimulation

5. **Skepticism About Effectiveness**:
   - Share evidence-based research on acupressure benefits
   - Encourage participants to try techniques on themselves for minor discomforts
   - Invite local healthcare providers who have used acupressure to share experiences

6. **Limited Resources**:
   - Teach techniques that can be done without special equipment
   - Provide durable, laminated handouts for long-term use
   - Encourage participants to create their own visual aids using local materials
