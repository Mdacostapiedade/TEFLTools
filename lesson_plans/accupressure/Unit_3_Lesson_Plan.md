# Lesson Plan: Acupressure Techniques for Labor

## 1. Resources Needed

- Illustrated handouts of labor-related acupressure points (in Tetum)
- Practice mannequins or cushions
- Basic anatomy charts focusing on the female body during pregnancy
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and screen (if available)
- Massage oil or lotion

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, participants will be able to:
- Identify at least 5 key acupressure points for labor support
- Demonstrate proper technique for applying pressure to these points
- Explain when and how to use specific points during different stages of labor
- Create a simple visual aid for use in birth settings

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Pair participants and have them share a brief story about a birth they've attended or heard about in their community
- Discuss as a group: What are some common challenges women face during labor in Timor-Leste?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Acupressure
- Contraction
- Cervical dilation
- Transition
- Endorphins

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Overview of acupressure benefits during labor
2. Introduction to key acupressure points:
   - SP6 (Spleen 6) for cervical dilation
   - LI4 (Large Intestine 4) for pain relief
   - BL32 (Bladder 32) for back pain and contractions
   - GB21 (Gallbladder 21) for labor progression
   - KD1 (Kidney 1) for grounding and calming
3. Demonstration of proper technique for applying pressure
4. Guidelines for when to use each point during labor stages

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Divide participants into small groups
2. Rotate through stations to practice locating and applying pressure to each point:
   - Station 1: SP6 and LI4
   - Station 2: BL32 and GB21
   - Station 3: KD1 and review of all points
3. Provide feedback and correction as needed

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. In pairs, create a simple visual aid showing the key acupressure points for labor
2. Practice explaining to each other when and how to use these points during labor

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

1. Group discussion: What challenges might you face when using these techniques in your community?
2. Quick review quiz: Call out a labor scenario and have participants identify which acupressure point(s) might be most helpful

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Practice locating and applying pressure to all points learned today on a willing family member or friend
- Create a small pocket guide with drawings of the acupressure points for personal use during births

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Acupressure: A technique of applying pressure to specific points on the body to relieve pain or other symptoms
- Contraction: The tightening of the uterus during labor
- Cervical dilation: The opening of the cervix during labor, measured in centimeters
- Transition: The intense final phase of the first stage of labor
- Endorphins: Natural pain-relieving chemicals released by the body
