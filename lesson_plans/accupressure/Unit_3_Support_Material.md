## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Full Body Diagram**: A simple outline of a female body with the five key acupressure points clearly marked and labeled.

2. **Individual Point Close-ups**: Detailed diagrams of each acupressure point, showing:
   - Exact location on the body part
   - Surrounding anatomical landmarks
   - Proper finger placement for applying pressure

3. **Labor Stages Chart**: A visual representation of the stages of labor, with corresponding acupressure points recommended for each stage.

4. **Pressure Technique Illustration**: Diagrams showing the correct way to apply pressure, including:
   - Finger positioning
   - Direction of pressure
   - Visual representation of pressure intensity

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Acupressure Point Locator Worksheet**: 
   - Outline drawings of body parts with key anatomical landmarks
   - Participants mark the correct locations of acupressure points
   - Space for notes on how to locate each point

2. **Labor Scenario Cards**:
   - Description of various labor scenarios (e.g., "Woman experiencing intense back pain during contractions")
   - Participants identify appropriate acupressure points and techniques

3. **Personal Reference Guide Template**:
   - Blank template for participants to create their own quick-reference guide
   - Spaces for drawing points, noting indications, and adding personal tips

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Acupressure for Natural Pain Relief in Labor" by Debra Betts (book recommendation)
2. Online video series: "Acupressure Techniques for Midwives" (with Tetum subtitles)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barrier**: 
   - Use visual aids extensively
   - Employ a local translator if needed
   - Encourage participants to explain concepts to each other in their own words

2. **Cultural Sensitivity**:
   - Begin with a discussion on local birth practices
   - Emphasize integration with, not replacement of, traditional methods
   - Invite a respected local midwife or healer to co-facilitate if possible

3. **Varying Literacy Levels**:
   - Provide information in both written and pictorial formats
   - Use hands-on practice extensively
   - Encourage peer-to-peer teaching

4. **Skepticism about Traditional Chinese Medicine**:
   - Share scientific studies on acupressure's effectiveness
   - Focus on practical benefits rather than theoretical concepts
   - Invite participants to share personal experiences with traditional healing

5. **Difficulty Locating Points**:
   - Use anatomical models or charts for clear visualization
   - Provide ample time for supervised practice
   - Consider using acupoint stimulators for clearer sensation

6. **Limited Resources in Birth Settings**:
   - Teach techniques that don't require special equipment
   - Provide durable, waterproof quick-reference cards
   - Discuss adaptations for various birth environments (home, clinic, hospital)
