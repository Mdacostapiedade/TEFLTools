# Lesson Plan: Postpartum Acupressure Care

## 1. Resources Needed

- Illustrated handouts of postpartum acupressure points (in Tetum)
- Practice mannequins or cushions
- Basic anatomy charts focusing on postpartum physiology
- Flip chart and markers
- Acupressure point stimulation tools (e.g., blunt probes)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, participants will be able to:
- Identify key acupressure points for postpartum recovery
- Demonstrate proper techniques for stimulating these points
- Explain the benefits of acupressure for breastfeeding and emotional well-being
- Develop a basic postpartum care plan incorporating acupressure

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Group discussion: Participants share traditional postpartum care practices in their communities
- Instructor records key points on flip chart, highlighting any practices that align with acupressure principles

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Uterine involution
- Milk production
- Postpartum depression
- Oxytocin
- Let-down reflex

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Acupressure Points for Uterine Involution
- Explain the process of uterine involution
- Demonstrate points SP6, CV6, and ST36
- Discuss proper stimulation techniques and frequency

### Acupressure for Milk Production
- Explain the physiology of milk production
- Demonstrate points GB21, SI1, and LV3
- Discuss how these points can support the let-down reflex

### Acupressure for Postpartum Emotional Well-being
- Discuss common emotional challenges postpartum
- Demonstrate points HT7, PC6, and Yintang
- Explain how these points can help balance mood and reduce anxiety

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

- Divide participants into pairs
- Each pair practices locating and stimulating the taught points on mannequins or cushions
- Instructor circulates to provide feedback and correction

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- In small groups, participants develop a sample postpartum care plan incorporating acupressure
- Groups present their plans to the class, explaining their rationale for included points and techniques

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Quick review quiz: Instructor points to various body areas, participants name the relevant acupressure point and its function

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Practice locating and stimulating the learned points on themselves or willing family members
- Create an illustrated guide of 3 key postpartum acupressure points to share with a new mother in their community

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Uterine involution: The process by which the uterus returns to its pre-pregnancy size
- Milk production: The synthesis and secretion of breast milk
- Postpartum depression: A type of mood disorder associated with childbirth
- Oxytocin: A hormone that promotes bonding and stimulates milk let-down
- Let-down reflex: The release of milk from the mammary glands in response to stimulation
