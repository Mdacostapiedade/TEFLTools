## Acupressure Points for Uterine Involution

### Process of Uterine Involution
- Definition: The process by which the uterus returns to its pre-pregnancy size and position
- Typically takes 6-8 weeks postpartum
- Importance for maternal health and recovery

### Key Acupressure Points
1. SP6 (Spleen 6)
   - Location: 3 cun above the tip of the medial malleolus
   - Benefits: Promotes uterine contractions, helps with lochia discharge
   - Technique: Apply firm pressure for 1-2 minutes, 2-3 times daily

2. CV6 (Conception Vessel 6)
   - Location: 1.5 cun below the navel
   - Benefits: Strengthens uterus, aids in involution
   - Technique: Gentle circular massage for 2-3 minutes, 1-2 times daily

3. ST36 (Stomach 36)
   - Location: 3 cun below the knee, one finger-breadth lateral to the anterior crest of the tibia
   - Benefits: Boosts energy, supports overall recovery
   - Technique: Apply moderate pressure for 1-2 minutes on each leg, daily

### Proper Stimulation Techniques
- Use thumb or index finger for precise point location
- Apply steady pressure, gradually increasing intensity
- Avoid overstimulation - listen to the body's response
- Contraindications: Avoid SP6 if excessive bleeding occurs

## Acupressure for Milk Production

### Physiology of Milk Production
- Prolactin hormone stimulates milk production
- Oxytocin triggers milk let-down reflex
- Importance of frequent stimulation for maintaining supply

### Key Acupressure Points
1. GB21 (Gallbladder 21)
   - Location: Midway between C7 vertebra and the acromion process
   - Benefits: Promotes milk production, relieves shoulder tension
   - Technique: Gentle pressure or light massage for 1-2 minutes on each side

2. SI1 (Small Intestine 1)
   - Location: On the outer corner of the nail bed of the little finger
   - Benefits: Stimulates milk production, clears heat from the breast
   - Technique: Gentle pressure or massage for 30 seconds on each hand

3. LV3 (Liver 3)
   - Location: On the dorsum of the foot, in the depression distal to the junction of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones
   - Benefits: Promotes smooth flow of qi, supports overall milk production
   - Technique: Apply moderate pressure for 1-2 minutes on each foot

### Supporting Let-down Reflex
- Importance of relaxation for effective let-down
- Combining acupressure with deep breathing exercises
- Encouraging skin-to-skin contact with baby during stimulation

## Acupressure for Postpartum Emotional Well-being

### Common Emotional Challenges Postpartum
- Baby blues vs. postpartum depression
- Anxiety and mood swings
- Impact of hormonal changes and sleep deprivation

### Key Acupressure Points
1. HT7 (Heart 7)
   - Location: On the wrist crease, in line with the little finger
   - Benefits: Calms the mind, promotes emotional balance
   - Technique: Apply gentle pressure for 1-2 minutes on each wrist

2. PC6 (Pericardium 6)
   - Location: 3 finger-breadths below the wrist crease, between the tendons
   - Benefits: Relieves anxiety, promotes relaxation
   - Technique: Apply moderate pressure or use acupressure bands

3. Yintang (Extra Point)
   - Location: Midway between the eyebrows
   - Benefits: Calms the mind, relieves stress and anxiety
   - Technique: Gentle circular massage for 1-2 minutes

### Integrating Acupressure with Other Support Strategies
- Importance of social support and professional help when needed
- Combining acupressure with mindfulness and relaxation techniques
- Encouraging self-care practices for new mothers

# Discussion Questions

1. How might traditional postpartum practices in Timor-Leste complement or conflict with acupressure techniques for uterine involution?

2. What cultural beliefs or practices surrounding breastfeeding exist in your community? How can acupressure be sensitively introduced to support milk production?

3. Discuss the potential barriers to addressing postpartum emotional well-being in Timor-Leste. How can acupressure be presented as a supportive tool without stigmatizing mental health concerns?

4. How can healthcare workers effectively communicate the benefits of acupressure to new mothers who may be unfamiliar with Traditional Chinese Medicine concepts?

5. What strategies could be employed to gain acceptance and support from traditional healers or community elders for incorporating acupressure into postpartum care?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Postpartum Care Plan Development

1. Divide into groups of 3-4 participants.
2. Each group will create a comprehensive postpartum care plan that incorporates acupressure techniques.
3. The care plan should cover the first 6 weeks postpartum and include:
   - A daily schedule of recommended acupressure points and techniques
   - Integration with other postpartum care practices (e.g., nutrition, rest)
   - Considerations for different postpartum scenarios (e.g., cesarean birth, breastfeeding challenges)
4. Use the provided template to structure your care plan.
5. Include clear instructions and illustrations for each acupressure technique.
6. Consider cultural sensitivity and how to present the information effectively to new mothers in Timor-Leste.
7. Prepare to present your care plan to the class, explaining your rationale for included points and techniques.

# Assignment Details

## Community Education Project

1. Create an illustrated guide of 3 key postpartum acupressure points to share with a new mother in your community.
2. The guide should include:
   - Clear illustrations of each point's location
   - Simple instructions in Tetum for how to stimulate each point
   - Brief explanations of the benefits of each point
   - Any relevant safety considerations or contraindications
3. Design the guide to be culturally appropriate and easy to understand for someone with limited literacy.
4. Test your guide with a community member and gather feedback on its clarity and usefulness.
5. Be prepared to present your guide to the class and discuss your experience sharing it with a community member.
