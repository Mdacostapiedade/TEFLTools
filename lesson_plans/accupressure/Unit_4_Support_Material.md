   - Start with basic anatomy lessons if needed
   - Use simple language and relatable analogies when explaining physiological processes

4. **Hesitation to Practice on Others**
   - Encourage practice on mannequins or cushions initially
   - Gradually introduce partner work as comfort levels increase

5. **Skepticism about Effectiveness**
   - Share scientific studies supporting acupressure when available
   - Invite local practitioners or mothers who have benefited from acupressure to share their experiences

6. **Difficulty Locating Points**
   - Provide clear, illustrated guides for each point
   - Offer plenty of hands-on practice time with instructor guidance
