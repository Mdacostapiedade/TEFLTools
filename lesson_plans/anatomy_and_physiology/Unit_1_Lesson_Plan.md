# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Anatomy and Physiology

## 1. Resources Needed

- Textbook: Tortora, G.J. & Derrickson, B. Principles of Anatomy and Physiology
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with blank body outline diagrams
- Colored pencils or markers
- Large poster paper
- Laptop and projector for PowerPoint presentation

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define anatomy and physiology
- Describe the levels of structural organization in the body
- Explain the concept of homeostasis
- Use basic anatomical terminology to describe body regions and planes

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Have students pair up and take turns pointing to and naming as many external body parts as they can in 2 minutes
- Discuss as a class which parts were easy or difficult to name, introducing the idea of precise anatomical terminology

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Write the following terms on the board and briefly explain each:
- Anatomy
- Physiology
- Homeostasis
- Tissue
- Organ
- Organ system
- Anterior/Posterior
- Superior/Inferior
- Medial/Lateral

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

Use PowerPoint slides to cover:
1. Definitions of anatomy and physiology
2. Levels of structural organization:
   - Chemical level
   - Cellular level
   - Tissue level
   - Organ level
   - Organ system level
   - Organism level
3. Concept of homeostasis and basic feedback mechanisms
4. Anatomical terminology and body planes

## 6. Practice Activities (25 minutes)

1. Body Planes Labeling (10 minutes):
   - Distribute handouts with blank body outlines
   - Have students label major body regions and draw/label the three main body planes

2. Levels of Organization Sorting (15 minutes):
   - Provide students with a list of various structures (e.g., heart, bicep muscle, red blood cell, stomach, lipid molecule)
   - Have them sort these into the correct levels of organization

## 7. Production Task (20 minutes)

Concept Map Creation:
- In small groups, have students create a concept map on large poster paper showing the relationships between the levels of structural organization
- Groups should include examples at each level

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Have each group briefly present their concept map
- Conduct a quick verbal quiz on key terms and concepts covered

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Read textbook chapter on body organization and homeostasis
2. Write a one-page reflection on how understanding anatomy and physiology will be important for their nursing career in Timor-Leste
3. Research and list 5 examples of how the body maintains homeostasis in Timor-Leste's tropical climate

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Anatomy: The study of the structure of body parts and their relationships to one another
- Physiology: The study of the function of body parts and the body as a whole
- Homeostasis: The maintenance of a stable internal environment in the body
- Tissue: A group of similar cells that perform a common function
- Organ: A structure composed of two or more tissue types that performs a specific function
- Organ system: A group of organs that work together to perform a common function
- Anterior: Toward the front of the body
- Posterior: Toward the back of the body
- Superior: Above or toward the head
- Inferior: Below or toward the feet
- Medial: Toward the midline of the body
- Lateral: Away from the midline of the body
