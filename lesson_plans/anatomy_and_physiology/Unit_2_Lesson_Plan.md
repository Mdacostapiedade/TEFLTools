# Lesson Plan: Cells and Tissues

## 1. Resources Needed

- Microscopes and prepared slides of different tissue types
- Materials for 3D cell model (e.g., clay, styrofoam balls, pipe cleaners, beads)
- Handouts with cell diagrams and tissue type characteristics
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Whiteboard and markers

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe the structure and function of major cell organelles
- Identify the four main tissue types and their characteristics
- Explain how cells and tissues contribute to organ function
- Relate cell and tissue structure to common health issues in Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

"Cell Function Guessing Game": Students work in pairs. One student describes the function of a cell organelle without naming it, while the other tries to guess which organelle it is.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and define key terms:
- Organelle
- Membrane transport
- Epithelial tissue
- Connective tissue
- Muscle tissue
- Nervous tissue

Use visual aids and simple analogies to explain each term.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### Cell Structure and Organelles
- Overview of cell structure
- Detailed explanation of major organelles and their functions
- Cell membrane structure and transport mechanisms

### Four Main Tissue Types
- Characteristics and functions of epithelial tissue
- Characteristics and functions of connective tissue
- Characteristics and functions of muscle tissue
- Characteristics and functions of nervous tissue

### Cells, Tissues, and Organ Function
- How cells form tissues
- How tissues form organs
- Examples of how cell and tissue structure relate to organ function

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Microscope Lab
Students observe prepared slides of different tissue types under microscopes, sketching and labeling what they see.

### Cell Organelle Matching Game
Students match organelle names with their functions and a simple diagram.

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

### Build a 3D Cell Model
In small groups, students create a 3D model of a cell using local materials, labeling organelles and explaining their functions to the class.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key concepts covered
- Class discussion: "How might damage to specific cell types or tissues affect organ function?"

## 9. Homework Assignment

Case study analysis: Students read a short case study about a common health issue in Timor-Leste (e.g., malaria, tuberculosis) and explain how it relates to cell or tissue damage. They should write a 1-page report on their findings.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Organelle: Specialized structures within a cell that perform specific functions
- Membrane transport: The movement of substances across the cell membrane
- Epithelial tissue: Tissue that covers body surfaces and lines cavities
- Connective tissue: Tissue that supports, connects, and separates other tissues and organs
- Muscle tissue: Tissue capable of contraction, responsible for movement
- Nervous tissue: Tissue that transmits electrical signals in the body
