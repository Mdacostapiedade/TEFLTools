# Lecture Notes

## Cell Structure and Organelles

### Overview of Cell Structure
- Cells are the basic unit of life
- All living organisms are composed of cells
- Two main types: prokaryotic (bacteria) and eukaryotic (plants, animals, fungi)
- Focus on eukaryotic cells for human anatomy

### Major Organelles and Their Functions
1. Nucleus
   - Control center of the cell
   - Contains DNA (genetic material)
   - Regulates gene expression and cell division

2. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
   - Rough ER: protein synthesis and modification
   - Smooth ER: lipid synthesis and detoxification

3. Golgi Apparatus
   - Modifies, packages, and distributes proteins
   - Creates lysosomes

4. Mitochondria
   - "Powerhouse" of the cell
   - Site of cellular respiration and ATP production

5. Lysosomes
   - Contain digestive enzymes
   - Break down cellular waste and foreign materials

6. Ribosomes
   - Site of protein synthesis
   - Found free in cytoplasm or attached to rough ER

7. Cytoskeleton
   - Provides structure and support
   - Assists in cell movement and intracellular transport

### Cell Membrane Structure and Transport
- Phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins
- Selectively permeable
- Transport mechanisms:
  1. Passive transport (diffusion, osmosis)
  2. Active transport (requires energy)
  3. Vesicular transport (endocytosis, exocytosis)

## Four Main Tissue Types

### Epithelial Tissue
- Covers body surfaces and lines cavities
- Functions: protection, secretion, absorption, filtration
- Types: squamous, cuboidal, columnar (simple and stratified)
- Examples: skin, lining of digestive tract, kidney tubules

### Connective Tissue
- Supports, connects, and separates other tissues and organs
- Types: loose (areolar, adipose) and dense (fibrous, cartilage, bone)
- Functions: support, protection, insulation, transport of substances
- Examples: tendons, ligaments, fat, blood

### Muscle Tissue
- Capable of contraction
- Types: skeletal, cardiac, smooth
- Functions: movement, posture, heat production
- Examples: biceps (skeletal), heart (cardiac), blood vessel walls (smooth)

### Nervous Tissue
- Transmits electrical signals in the body
- Composed of neurons and supporting cells (glia)
- Functions: sensory input, integration, motor output
- Examples: brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves

## Cells, Tissues, and Organ Function
- Cells form tissues
- Tissues form organs
- Organs work together in organ systems
- Example: Digestive system
  - Epithelial tissue lines the digestive tract (absorption)
  - Smooth muscle tissue in stomach and intestines (peristalsis)
  - Nervous tissue controls digestive processes
  - Connective tissue supports and connects organs

# Discussion Questions

1. How do the structures of different cell organelles relate to their functions?
2. Compare and contrast the four main tissue types. How does their structure contribute to their specific roles in the body?
3. Explain how damage to a specific tissue type might affect organ function. Provide an example relevant to health issues in Timor-Leste.
4. How does the cell membrane's structure allow for selective permeability? Why is this important for cell function?
5. Discuss the relationship between cells, tissues, and organs. How does this hierarchical organization contribute to the overall function of the human body?
6. How might environmental factors in Timor-Leste (e.g., climate, diet) affect cellular and tissue function?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Choose one organ in the human body and explain how its function depends on the coordinated action of different cell types and tissues. Include specific examples of how damage to certain cells or tissues within this organ could lead to health problems. Relate your discussion to a common health issue in Timor-Leste."

Guidelines:
- Clearly identify the organ you have chosen
- Describe at least three different cell types or tissues found in this organ
- Explain how these cells/tissues work together to perform the organ's function
- Provide a specific example of a health problem that could result from cellular or tissue damage in this organ
- Relate your discussion to the Timorese context (e.g., prevalent diseases, environmental factors, cultural practices)
- Use proper anatomical terminology throughout your essay
- Cite at least two reliable sources to support your information

# Assignment Details

## Case Study Analysis

Read the following case study and write a 1-page report addressing the questions below:

Case Study: Malaria in Timor-Leste

Maria, a 25-year-old woman from a rural village in Timor-Leste, has been experiencing fever, chills, and fatigue for the past three days. She visits a local health clinic, where the nurse suspects malaria. A blood test confirms the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in Maria's red blood cells.

Questions to address in your report:
1. Briefly explain the life cycle of the malaria parasite in human cells.
2. Describe how the parasite's invasion and multiplication within red blood cells can lead to the symptoms Maria is experiencing.
3. Discuss how malaria affects different tissue types in the body (e.g., blood, liver).
4. Explain why certain individuals (e.g., pregnant women, young children) are at higher risk for severe malaria.
5. Suggest two ways that understanding cell and tissue biology can help in the prevention or treatment of malaria in Timor-Leste.

Your report should demonstrate a clear understanding of cell structure, function, and how parasitic infection can disrupt normal cellular processes. Use proper terminology and cite at least one reliable source.
