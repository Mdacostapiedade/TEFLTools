# Lesson Plan: Integumentary and Skeletal Systems

## 1. Resources Needed

- Textbook: Tortora & Derrickson, Principles of Anatomy and Physiology
- Anatomical models of skin layers and skeletal system
- Microscope slides of skin tissue
- Bone and joint models
- Handouts with diagrams of skin layers and major bones
- Materials for skin analysis activity (magnifying glasses, pH strips, etc.)
- Skeletal system puzzle pieces
- Art supplies for poster creation

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe the structure and functions of the skin's layers
- Identify the major bones and joints of the skeletal system
- Explain how the integumentary and skeletal systems protect the body
- Analyze different Timorese skin types
- Assemble a skeletal system puzzle
- Create a public health poster on preventing sun damage

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Students pair up and examine each other's skin on their hands and arms. They should note and discuss:
- Visible structures (hair, nails, pores)
- Texture differences
- Color variations
- Any unique features (moles, scars, etc.)

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and define key terms:
- Epidermis
- Dermis
- Subcutaneous layer
- Melanin
- Keratin
- Osseous tissue
- Compact bone
- Spongy bone
- Periosteum
- Synovial joint

Use visual aids and ask students to repeat terms.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Integumentary System (25 minutes)
- Explain the layers of skin using anatomical models and diagrams
- Discuss functions of skin: protection, temperature regulation, sensation, synthesis of vitamin D
- Describe skin appendages: hair, nails, glands
- Highlight melanin production and its importance in Timorese population

### Skeletal System (20 minutes)
- Overview of skeletal system functions
- Explain bone tissue types and structure
- Identify major bones using skeletal model
- Discuss joint types and movements
- Emphasize how bones and joints work together for support and movement

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Skin Analysis Lab (15 minutes)
Students work in small groups to analyze and compare different skin types among classmates:
- Use magnifying glasses to observe skin closely
- Test skin pH with pH strips
- Note differences in pigmentation, oiliness, etc.
- Discuss how different skin types may react to Timorese climate

### Skeletal System Puzzle (15 minutes)
In pairs, students assemble a skeletal system puzzle, identifying and naming major bones as they go.

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

Students design a public health poster on preventing skin damage from sun exposure, relevant to the Timorese context. Posters should include:
- Diagram of skin layers
- Explanation of how UV rays damage skin
- Tips for sun protection suitable for Timorese lifestyle and climate
- Visual elements that appeal to local community

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick quiz: students label blank diagrams of skin layers and major bones
- Class discussion: How do the integumentary and skeletal systems work together to protect the body?
- Address any remaining questions

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Read textbook chapters on integumentary and skeletal systems
2. Write a 1-page reflection on how traditional Timorese practices or beliefs relate to skin care or bone health
3. Research and list 5 common skin conditions or bone/joint problems in Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Epidermis: Outermost layer of skin, composed of stratified squamous epithelium
- Dermis: Layer of skin beneath the epidermis, containing blood vessels, nerve endings, and various glands
- Subcutaneous layer: Deepest layer of skin, primarily composed of adipose tissue
- Melanin: Pigment that gives skin its color and provides protection against UV radiation
- Keratin: Protein that makes up most of the epidermis and provides waterproofing
- Osseous tissue: Bone tissue, a type of connective tissue that forms the skeleton
- Compact bone: Dense, smooth bone tissue that forms the outer layer of bones
- Spongy bone: Porous bone tissue found inside bones, containing red bone marrow
- Periosteum: Tough membrane covering the outer surface of bones
- Synovial joint: Most common and most movable type of joint in the body, characterized by a fluid-filled cavity
