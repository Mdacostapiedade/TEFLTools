## Integumentary System

### Skin Layers
- Epidermis
  * Outermost layer
  * Composed of stratified squamous epithelium
  * Main cell type: keratinocytes
  * Layers: stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum lucidum (thick skin only), stratum corneum
  * Melanocytes produce melanin for pigmentation and UV protection

- Dermis
  * Lies beneath epidermis
  * Composed of connective tissue
  * Contains blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles, and glands
  * Two layers: papillary dermis and reticular dermis

- Hypodermis (Subcutaneous layer)
  * Not technically part of the skin, but closely associated
  * Primarily composed of adipose tissue
  * Functions in insulation and energy storage

### Skin Functions
1. Protection: Physical barrier against pathogens, chemicals, and UV radiation
2. Temperature regulation: Through sweat production and blood flow adjustments
3. Sensation: Contains various receptors for touch, pressure, temperature, and pain
4. Vitamin D synthesis: UVB radiation converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3
5. Excretion: Removes small amounts of waste products through sweat
6. Immunity: Langerhans cells in epidermis are part of the immune system

### Skin Appendages
- Hair: Composed of keratin, grows from follicles in the dermis
- Nails: Hardened keratin plates that protect fingertips and toes
- Sebaceous glands: Produce sebum to lubricate and waterproof skin and hair
- Sweat glands: Eccrine (all over body) and apocrine (axillae, groin)

### Melanin in Timorese Population
- Higher melanin content provides better protection against UV radiation
- Darker skin tones are adaptive in regions with high sun exposure
- Importance of vitamin D synthesis despite higher melanin levels

## Skeletal System

### Functions of the Skeletal System
1. Support: Provides framework for the body
2. Protection: Shields vital organs (e.g., skull protects brain)
3. Movement: Works with muscles to enable locomotion
4. Blood cell production: Red bone marrow produces blood cells
5. Mineral storage: Calcium and phosphorus reservoir
6. Endocrine function: Produces hormones like calcitonin

### Bone Tissue Types
- Compact (cortical) bone: Dense, smooth outer layer of bones
- Spongy (trabecular) bone: Porous inner structure, contains red bone marrow

### Bone Structure
- Periosteum: Tough outer membrane covering bone surface
- Diaphysis: Long shaft of long bones
- Epiphyses: Expanded ends of long bones
- Medullary cavity: Central cavity containing yellow bone marrow
- Articular cartilage: Covers joint surfaces

### Major Bones
- Axial skeleton:
  * Skull (22 bones)
  * Vertebral column (26 bones)
  * Sternum and ribs
- Appendicular skeleton:
  * Upper limbs: clavicle, scapula, humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals, phalanges
  * Lower limbs: hip bones, femur, patella, tibia, fibula, tarsals, metatarsals, phalanges

### Joint Types
1. Fibrous: Immovable (e.g., skull sutures)
2. Cartilaginous: Slightly movable (e.g., intervertebral discs)
3. Synovial: Freely movable (e.g., knee, hip)
   - Types: Ball and socket, hinge, pivot, ellipsoid, saddle, gliding

### Joint Movements
- Flexion/Extension
- Abduction/Adduction
- Rotation
- Circumduction
- Pronation/Supination

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the structure of the skin contribute to its various functions? Provide specific examples.

2. Compare and contrast the epidermis and dermis in terms of structure and function.

3. Discuss the importance of melanin in skin pigmentation and protection. How might this be particularly relevant to the Timorese population?

4. Explain how the skeletal system provides both support and protection for the body. Give examples of bones that primarily serve each function.

5. Describe the relationship between bone structure and function. How do compact and spongy bone contribute differently to the overall function of a bone?

6. How do the integumentary and skeletal systems work together to protect the body? Provide specific examples of this interaction.

7. Discuss the importance of joints in the skeletal system. How do different types of joints contribute to various movements?

8. How might traditional Timorese practices or beliefs relate to skin care or bone health? Consider both potential benefits and risks.

9. What are some common skin conditions or bone/joint problems that might be prevalent in Timor-Leste? How might environmental or lifestyle factors contribute to these issues?

10. How does the integumentary system help maintain homeostasis in the body? Consider its role in temperature regulation and fluid balance.

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Essay: Traditional Practices and Modern Understanding

Write a 500-word reflective essay exploring the relationship between traditional Timorese practices related to skin care or bone health and modern scientific understanding of the integumentary and skeletal systems. Consider the following points:

1. Describe at least two traditional practices or beliefs related to skin care or bone health in Timor-Leste.
2. Explain the scientific basis (or lack thereof) for these practices based on your understanding of the integumentary and skeletal systems.
3. Discuss any potential benefits or risks associated with these traditional practices.
4. Reflect on how you, as a future healthcare professional, might approach discussing these practices with patients while respecting cultural beliefs and promoting evidence-based care.
5. Conclude with your thoughts on integrating traditional knowledge and modern medical understanding in the Timorese healthcare context.

Use specific examples from the lecture material and your own research to support your discussion. Cite any external sources used.

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Osteoporosis in Timor-Leste

Maria, a 65-year-old woman from a rural village in Timor-Leste, comes to the clinic complaining of back pain and a noticeable loss of height over the past few years. She has a small frame and mentions that she doesn't consume much dairy or engage in regular exercise. Her diet consists mainly of rice, vegetables, and occasionally fish or chicken.

Questions for analysis:
1. Based on the information provided, what condition might Maria be suffering from?
2. How does this condition relate to the skeletal system?
3. What risk factors for this condition are present in Maria's case?
4. How might cultural or environmental factors in Timor-Leste contribute to this condition?
5. What diagnostic tests would you recommend?
6. Suggest some preventive measures and treatments appropriate for the Timorese context.

## Skin Type Analysis Guide

Use this guide to analyze and compare different skin types among your classmates:

2. Check for oiliness:
   - Dry
   - Normal
   - Oily
   - Combination

4. Look for specific features:
   - Freckles
   - Moles
   - Birthmarks
   - Scars

   - Combination

7. Check for signs of sun damage:
   - Sunspots
   - Premature wrinkles

Record your observations and discuss how different skin types might react to the Timorese climate and require different care routines.
