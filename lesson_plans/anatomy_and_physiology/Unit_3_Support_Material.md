# Support Materials for Integumentary and Skeletal Systems Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Epidermis: Outermost layer of skin, composed of stratified squamous epithelium
- Dermis: Layer of skin beneath the epidermis, containing blood vessels, nerve endings, and various glands
- Subcutaneous layer: Deepest layer of skin, primarily composed of adipose tissue
- Melanin: Pigment that gives skin its color and provides protection against UV radiation
- Keratin: Protein that makes up most of the epidermis and provides waterproofing
- Osseous tissue: Bone tissue, a type of connective tissue that forms the skeleton
- Compact bone: Dense, smooth bone tissue that forms the outer layer of bones
- Spongy bone: Porous bone tissue found inside bones, containing red bone marrow
- Periosteum: Tough membrane covering the outer surface of bones
- Synovial joint: Most common and most movable type of joint in the body, characterized by a fluid-filled cavity

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with anatomical terminology
   - Solution: Create a word wall with key terms and their definitions. Use mnemonic devices and regular vocabulary review games.

2. Challenge: Difficulty visualizing 3D structures from 2D diagrams
   - Solution: Use 3D models whenever possible. Encourage students to create their own 3D models using clay or other materials.

3. Challenge: Connecting anatomy to real-life health scenarios in Timor-Leste
   - Solution: Incorporate local case studies and health statistics. Invite guest speakers from local healthcare facilities to share experiences.

4. Challenge: Varying levels of prior knowledge among students
   - Solution: Implement pre-assessment quizzes to gauge understanding. Use differentiated instruction techniques to address diverse learning needs.

5. Challenge: Limited resources for hands-on activities
   - Solution: Develop creative alternatives using locally available materials. For example, use fruits or vegetables to demonstrate skin layers or joint movements.

6. Challenge: Cultural sensitivity regarding body examination activities
   - Solution: Discuss the importance of these activities for medical education. Allow students to work in same-gender pairs if preferred and ensure a respectful classroom environment.
