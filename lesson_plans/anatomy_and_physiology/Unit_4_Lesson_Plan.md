# Lesson Plan: Muscular and Nervous Systems

## 1. Resources Needed

- Textbook: Tortora, G.J. & Derrickson, B. Principles of Anatomy and Physiology
- Anatomical models of muscles and nerves
- Microscope slides of muscle tissue
- Dissection kits and chicken legs
- Stopwatches or smartphone timers
- Reflex hammers
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with diagrams of muscle structure and nervous system organization

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Describe the structure and function of skeletal muscle
2. Explain the organization of the nervous system
3. Understand how muscles and nerves work together for movement
4. Demonstrate basic knowledge of muscle contraction mechanism
5. Identify key components of the central and peripheral nervous systems
6. Explain the concept of the neuromuscular junction and reflexes

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Have students pair up and take turns testing each other's knee-jerk reflex using reflex hammers
- Ask students to hypothesize why this reflex occurs and what body systems are involved

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Write the following terms on the whiteboard and briefly explain each:
- Sarcomere
- Neuron
- Synapse
- Neurotransmitter
- Motor unit
- Action potential
- Central nervous system
- Peripheral nervous system

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Muscle Tissue and Contraction
- Explain the three types of muscle tissue: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth
- Focus on skeletal muscle structure: muscle fibers, myofibrils, sarcomeres
- Describe the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction
- Discuss the role of calcium and ATP in muscle contraction

### Nervous System Organization
- Overview of central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and peripheral nervous system
- Explain basic neuron structure and function
- Describe how nerve impulses are transmitted along neurons and across synapses
- Introduce the concept of neurotransmitters

### Neuromuscular Junction and Reflexes
- Explain the structure and function of the neuromuscular junction
- Describe how nerve signals trigger muscle contraction
- Discuss the concept of motor units
- Explain simple reflex arcs and their importance

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Muscle Structure Identification:
   - Students examine microscope slides of muscle tissue and identify key structures
   - Label diagrams of muscle fibers and sarcomeres

2. Nervous System Mapping:
   - In small groups, students create concept maps showing the organization of the nervous system
   - Include major divisions and their functions

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

1. Chicken Leg Dissection:
   - In pairs, students dissect a chicken leg to observe muscle structure and attachment
   - Identify different muscle groups and their actions

2. Reflex Arc Role-play:
   - Groups of 5-6 students create a human model of a reflex arc
   - Each student represents a component (receptor, sensory neuron, interneuron, motor neuron, effector)
   - Act out the transmission of a nerve impulse through the reflex arc

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Conduct a quick quiz using student response systems or raised hands
- Sample questions:
  1. What are the main components of a sarcomere?
  2. How does calcium contribute to muscle contraction?
  3. What is the difference between the central and peripheral nervous systems?
  4. Describe the basic steps of synaptic transmission
  5. What happens at the neuromuscular junction?

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Read textbook chapters on muscle physiology and nervous system
2. Complete worksheet on labeling muscle and neuron structures
3. Write a 1-page summary explaining how understanding muscle and nerve function is important for nursing practice in Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Sarcomere: The basic functional unit of a muscle fiber
- Neuron: A specialized cell that transmits nerve impulses
- Synapse: The junction between two neurons where nerve signals are transmitted
- Neurotransmitter: A chemical messenger that transmits signals across a synapse
- Motor unit: A single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it innervates
- Action potential: An electrical impulse that travels along a neuron's membrane
- Central nervous system: The brain and spinal cord
- Peripheral nervous system: All nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord
