## Muscle Tissue and Contraction

### Types of Muscle Tissue
1. Skeletal muscle
   - Striated appearance
   - Voluntary control
   - Attached to bones
2. Cardiac muscle
   - Striated appearance
   - Involuntary control
   - Found only in the heart
3. Smooth muscle
   - Non-striated appearance
   - Involuntary control
   - Found in organs and blood vessels

### Skeletal Muscle Structure
- Muscle fibers (cells)
  - Long, cylindrical, multinucleated
- Myofibrils
  - Bundles of protein filaments
- Sarcomeres
  - Functional units of contraction
  - Composed of thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments

### Sliding Filament Theory
1. Myosin heads attach to actin filaments
2. Myosin heads pull actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere
3. Sarcomere shortens, causing muscle contraction

### Role of Calcium and ATP
- Calcium (Ca2+)
  - Released from sarcoplasmic reticulum
  - Binds to troponin, exposing actin binding sites
- ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)
  - Provides energy for myosin head movement
  - Allows myosin to detach from actin

## Nervous System Organization

### Central Nervous System (CNS)
- Brain
  - Cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem
- Spinal cord

### Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
- Cranial nerves
- Spinal nerves
- Ganglia

### Neuron Structure and Function
- Cell body (soma)
- Dendrites
- Axon
- Axon terminals

### Nerve Impulse Transmission
1. Resting potential
2. Depolarization
3. Action potential
4. Repolarization

### Synaptic Transmission
1. Action potential reaches axon terminal
2. Calcium influx
3. Neurotransmitter release
4. Binding to receptors on postsynaptic cell
5. Postsynaptic potential generation

## Neuromuscular Junction and Reflexes

### Neuromuscular Junction Structure
- Motor neuron axon terminal
- Synaptic cleft
- Motor end plate on muscle fiber

### Neuromuscular Transmission
1. Action potential reaches axon terminal
2. Acetylcholine release
3. Binding to receptors on motor end plate
4. Muscle fiber depolarization
5. Muscle contraction

### Motor Units
- Single motor neuron and all muscle fibers it innervates
- Varying sizes for fine or gross motor control

### Reflex Arcs
1. Stimulus activates sensory receptor
2. Sensory neuron transmits signal to spinal cord
3. Interneuron processes signal (if present)
4. Motor neuron transmits signal to effector
5. Effector (e.g., muscle) responds

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the structure of skeletal muscle contribute to its function?
2. Compare and contrast the three types of muscle tissue. How do their characteristics relate to their roles in the body?
3. Explain how calcium and ATP work together in muscle contraction. What would happen if either were depleted?
4. Describe the major divisions of the nervous system and their functions. How do they work together to control body processes?
5. What is the importance of the neuromuscular junction in body movement? How could disruptions at this site affect muscle function?
6. Discuss the role of reflexes in the body. How do they relate to the concept of homeostasis?
7. How might understanding muscle and nerve function inform nursing care for patients with conditions like muscular dystrophy or multiple sclerosis?
8. Explain how the sliding filament theory accounts for muscle contraction and relaxation.
9. Compare the transmission of a nerve impulse along a neuron to the transmission across a synapse. What are the key differences?
10. How does the organization of motor units allow for both fine and gross motor control?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Essay: Muscles and Nerves in Daily Life

Write a 500-word reflective essay exploring how your understanding of the muscular and nervous systems has changed your perception of everyday activities. Consider the following points:

1. Choose three daily activities (e.g., walking, eating, typing) and describe the muscular and nervous system processes involved.
2. Reflect on how this new knowledge affects your appreciation of your body's complexity.
3. Discuss how this understanding might influence your approach to patient care as a future nurse.
4. Consider any common health issues in Timor-Leste that relate to the muscular or nervous systems, and how your new knowledge might help you educate patients about these conditions.

Structure your essay with an introduction, body paragraphs addressing the points above, and a conclusion summarizing your main insights.

# Assignment Details

## Muscle and Nerve Function Case Study

### Objective
Apply your knowledge of muscle and nerve function to analyze a clinical case and propose appropriate nursing interventions.

### Instructions
1. Read the following case study:

   Maria, a 45-year-old woman from a rural village in Timor-Leste, comes to the clinic complaining of muscle weakness and tingling sensations in her hands and feet. She reports difficulty holding objects and maintaining balance when walking. Maria works as a farmer and has noticed these symptoms worsening over the past few months.

2. Answer the following questions:
   a. What potential issues with the muscular and/or nervous systems might explain Maria's symptoms?
   b. Describe the normal muscle and nerve functions that appear to be disrupted in this case.
   c. What additional information would you want to gather from Maria to better understand her condition?
   d. Propose three nursing interventions that could help Maria manage her symptoms and improve her daily functioning.
   e. How would you explain Maria's condition and your proposed interventions to her in a way that is culturally appropriate and easy to understand?

3. Your response should be 2-3 pages long, double-spaced, and include references to your textbook or other reliable sources.

4. Be prepared to discuss your analysis and proposed interventions in the next class.
