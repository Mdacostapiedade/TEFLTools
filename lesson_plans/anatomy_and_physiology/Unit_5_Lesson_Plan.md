# Lesson Plan: Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems

## 1. Resources Needed

- Textbook: Tortora, G.J. & Derrickson, B. Principles of Anatomy and Physiology
- Anatomical models of the heart and lungs
- Stethoscopes (1 per 2-3 students)
- Blood pressure cuffs (1 per 2-3 students)
- Simple spirometers (1 per 4-5 students)
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with diagrams of the heart, blood vessels, and lungs
- Case study worksheets on common cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in Timor-Leste

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Describe the basic structure and function of the heart
2. Explain the differences between arteries, veins, and capillaries
3. Outline the process of gas exchange in the lungs
4. Demonstrate how to measure vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate)
5. Interpret basic spirometry results
6. Relate cardiovascular and respiratory anatomy/physiology to common health issues in Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Students pair up and locate their partner's pulse at the wrist and neck
- Count pulse for 15 seconds and multiply by 4 to get beats per minute
- Compare results and discuss any differences observed

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Write the following terms on the board and briefly explain each:
- Cardiac cycle
- Systole/Diastole
- Pulmonary/Systemic circulation
- Alveoli
- Tidal volume
- Vital capacity

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Heart Anatomy and Cardiac Cycle
- Use heart model to show chambers, valves, and major blood vessels
- Explain basic path of blood flow through the heart
- Describe systole and diastole in relation to the cardiac cycle

### Blood Vessel Structure
- Compare and contrast arteries, veins, and capillaries
- Explain how blood vessel structure relates to function

### Lung Anatomy and Gas Exchange
- Use lung model to show trachea, bronchi, and alveoli
- Describe the process of gas exchange at the alveolar-capillary membrane
- Explain basic mechanics of inhalation and exhalation

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Heart diagram labeling exercise
2. Blood flow sequencing activity
3. Matching game: vessel type to characteristics

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

1. Vital Signs Measurement
   - Demonstrate proper technique for measuring pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate
   - Students practice on each other and record results

2. Spirometry Testing
   - Demonstrate use of simple spirometer
   - Students measure their own vital capacity and tidal volume

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick quiz: 5 multiple choice questions covering main concepts
- Class discussion: How do the cardiovascular and respiratory systems work together to maintain homeostasis?

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Read textbook chapter on cardiovascular and respiratory systems
2. Complete case study worksheet on a common cardiovascular or respiratory disease in Timor-Leste
3. Write a 1-page reflection on how understanding these systems can improve nursing care

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Cardiac cycle: The sequence of events that occurs as the heart contracts and relaxes, pumping blood through the body
- Systole: The phase of the heartbeat when the heart muscle contracts and pumps blood from the chambers
- Diastole: The phase of the heartbeat when the heart muscle relaxes and allows the chambers to fill with blood
- Pulmonary circulation: The flow of blood from the heart to the lungs and back to the heart
- Systemic circulation: The flow of blood from the heart to all parts of the body (except lungs) and back to the heart
- Alveoli: Tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs
- Tidal volume: The amount of air moved into or out of the lungs during normal breathing
- Vital capacity: The maximum amount of air a person can expel from the lungs after a maximum inhalation
