# Lecture Notes

## Heart Anatomy and the Cardiac Cycle

### Basic Heart Structure
- Four chambers: right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle
- Valves: tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, aortic
- Major blood vessels: superior and inferior vena cava, pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins, aorta

### Cardiac Cycle
1. Atrial systole: atria contract, pushing blood into ventricles
2. Ventricular systole: ventricles contract, pushing blood out to body and lungs
3. Atrial and ventricular diastole: all chambers relax, filling with blood

### Electrical Conduction System
- Sinoatrial (SA) node: natural pacemaker
- Atrioventricular (AV) node: delays impulse to allow atrial contraction
- Bundle of His and Purkinje fibers: rapidly conduct impulse through ventricles

## Blood Vessel Structure and Blood Flow

### Arteries
- Thick, elastic walls to withstand high pressure
- Carry oxygenated blood away from heart (except pulmonary artery)
- Progressively branch into smaller arterioles

### Veins
- Thinner walls with valves to prevent backflow
- Carry deoxygenated blood back to heart (except pulmonary veins)
- Progressively merge into larger vessels

### Capillaries
- Single cell thick walls for easy diffusion
- Site of gas and nutrient exchange with tissues
- Connect arterioles to venules

### Blood Flow
- Pulmonary circulation: right ventricle → lungs → left atrium
- Systemic circulation: left ventricle → body tissues → right atrium

## Lung Anatomy and Mechanics of Breathing

### Respiratory System Structure
- Upper respiratory tract: nose, pharynx, larynx
- Lower respiratory tract: trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli

### Gas Exchange
- Occurs in alveoli
- Oxygen diffuses from alveoli into capillaries
- Carbon dioxide diffuses from capillaries into alveoli

### Mechanics of Breathing
- Inhalation: diaphragm contracts, intercostal muscles raise ribs, lung volume increases, air rushes in
- Exhalation: diaphragm relaxes, intercostal muscles lower ribs, lung volume decreases, air pushed out

### Lung Volumes and Capacities
- Tidal volume: amount of air in one normal breath
- Vital capacity: maximum amount of air that can be exhaled after maximum inhalation
- Residual volume: air remaining in lungs after maximum exhalation

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the structure of the heart contribute to its function in pumping blood?
2. Compare and contrast the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Why are both necessary?
3. Explain how the structure of capillaries allows for efficient gas and nutrient exchange.
4. How do the cardiovascular and respiratory systems work together to maintain homeostasis?
5. Discuss how understanding heart and lung anatomy can help nurses assess patients more effectively.
6. What lifestyle factors common in Timor-Leste might impact cardiovascular and respiratory health?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay explaining the journey of an oxygen molecule from the air to a muscle cell in the leg. Include the following points:
- Entry into the respiratory system
- Gas exchange in the alveoli
- Transport through the circulatory system
- Diffusion into the muscle cell
- How this process might be affected by common respiratory or cardiovascular conditions in Timor-Leste

# Assignment Details

## Case Study Analysis

Choose one of the following common cardiovascular or respiratory diseases in Timor-Leste:
1. Rheumatic heart disease
2. Tuberculosis
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

Research the chosen condition and write a 2-3 page report addressing:
- Brief description of the disease
- How it affects normal cardiovascular or respiratory function
- Common symptoms and how they relate to the underlying physiological changes
- Prevalence and risk factors in Timor-Leste
- Basic nursing interventions for managing the condition

Include at least 3 reputable sources, with at least one being specific to the Timorese context.

## Spirometry Practice Guide

1. Explain procedure to the patient
2. Demonstrate proper technique:
   - Sit upright
   - Take a deep breath
   - Place mouthpiece in mouth, creating a tight seal with lips
   - Exhale forcefully and completely
3. Record results:
   - Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)
   - Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1)
4. Repeat test 3 times, use best result
5. Compare to predicted values based on age, height, and gender
