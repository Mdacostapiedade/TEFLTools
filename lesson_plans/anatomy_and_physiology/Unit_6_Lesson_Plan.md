# Lesson Plan: Digestive and Urinary Systems

## 1. Resources Needed

- Textbook: Tortora, G.J. & Derrickson, B. Principles of Anatomy and Physiology
- Anatomical models of digestive and urinary systems
- Poster paper and markers
- Microscopes and prepared slides of digestive/kidney tissue
- Urinalysis test strips and sample "urine" (colored water with various solutes)
- Local foods for digestive system model
- Handouts with diagrams of digestive and urinary systems

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify and describe the major organs of the digestive tract
2. Explain the basic stages of digestion and nutrient absorption
3. Describe the structure and functions of the kidneys
4. Explain the process of urine formation in the nephron
5. Discuss how the digestive and urinary systems regulate nutrients, wastes, and fluid balance

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Students work in pairs to list all the organs they think are involved in digestion and urination
- Class discussion to compile a master list on the board

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and define key terms:
  * Peristalsis
  * Enzymes
  * Absorption
  * Nephron
  * Filtration
  * Homeostasis
- Students create a vocabulary chart with definitions and simple drawings

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Digestive System (25 minutes)
- Overview of digestive tract anatomy using models and diagrams
- Explanation of mechanical and chemical digestion processes
- Discussion of nutrient absorption in small intestine
- Role of accessory organs (liver, pancreas, gallbladder)

### Urinary System (20 minutes)
- Overview of urinary system anatomy using models and diagrams
- Detailed explanation of nephron structure and function
- Process of urine formation: filtration, reabsorption, secretion
- Regulation of fluid balance and waste excretion

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Digestive System Labeling (15 minutes)
   - Students label blank diagrams of the digestive system
   - Peer review and correction

2. Nephron Function Sequencing (15 minutes)
   - Students arrange cards describing steps of urine formation in correct order
   - Class discussion to check answers

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

1. Create a Digestive System Model (25 minutes)
   - In small groups, students create a model of the digestive system using local foods
   - Groups present their models, explaining the function of each "organ"

2. Urinalysis Lab Simulation (20 minutes)
   - Students perform simulated urinalysis tests on prepared samples
   - Record and interpret results, relating to kidney function

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick quiz: students answer multiple-choice questions using response cards
- Address any remaining questions or misconceptions
- Summarize key points of the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a one-page report on a common digestive or urinary system disorder in Timor-Leste
2. Create a patient education brochure on the importance of hydration and proper nutrition for kidney health

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Peristalsis: Wave-like muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract
- Enzymes: Biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in digestion
- Absorption: The process by which nutrients pass from the digestive tract into the bloodstream
- Nephron: The functional unit of the kidney where blood filtration and urine formation occur
- Filtration: The process of separating solid particles from a fluid by passing it through a filter
- Homeostasis: The maintenance of a stable internal environment in the body
