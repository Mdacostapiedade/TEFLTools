## Digestive System

### Anatomy of the Digestive Tract

- Mouth: Mechanical breakdown begins, salivary amylase starts carbohydrate digestion
- Pharynx and Esophagus: Swallowing and peristalsis
- Stomach: Churning, acid secretion, protein digestion begins
- Small Intestine:
  * Duodenum: Receives secretions from pancreas and gallbladder
  * Jejunum and Ileum: Main sites of nutrient absorption
- Large Intestine: Water absorption, formation of feces

### Accessory Organs

- Liver: Produces bile, detoxifies blood, stores nutrients
- Pancreas: Secretes digestive enzymes and bicarbonate
- Gallbladder: Stores and concentrates bile

### Stages of Digestion

1. Ingestion: Taking food into the mouth
2. Propulsion: Moving food through the digestive tract
3. Mechanical digestion: Physical breakdown of food
4. Chemical digestion: Breakdown of food by enzymes
5. Absorption: Passage of nutrients into the bloodstream
6. Defecation: Elimination of undigested materials

### Nutrient Absorption

- Carbohydrates: Absorbed as monosaccharides
- Proteins: Absorbed as amino acids
- Lipids: Absorbed as fatty acids and glycerol
- Vitamins and Minerals: Various absorption mechanisms

## Urinary System

### Kidney Structure

- Cortex: Outer region containing renal corpuscles
- Medulla: Inner region containing renal pyramids
- Nephron: Functional unit of the kidney
  * Renal corpuscle: Glomerulus and Bowman's capsule
  * Proximal convoluted tubule
  * Loop of Henle
  * Distal convoluted tubule
  * Collecting duct

### Urine Formation

1. Filtration: Blood pressure forces fluid from glomerulus into Bowman's capsule
2. Reabsorption: Useful substances are returned to the blood
3. Secretion: Waste products are added to the filtrate
4. Concentration: Water is reabsorbed to concentrate urine

### Regulation of Fluid Balance

- Role of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
- Aldosterone and sodium reabsorption
- Regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system

### Waste Excretion

- Removal of nitrogenous wastes (urea, creatinine)
- Excretion of excess ions and foreign substances

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the structure of the small intestine maximize nutrient absorption?
2. Compare and contrast mechanical and chemical digestion. How do they work together?
3. Explain how the nephron maintains the body's fluid and electrolyte balance.
4. How might chronic dehydration affect kidney function? Relate this to Timor-Leste's climate.
5. Discuss the relationship between the digestive and urinary systems in maintaining homeostasis.
6. How could diet and lifestyle choices common in Timor-Leste impact digestive and urinary health?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Create a patient education brochure on hydration and nutrition for kidney health in Timor-Leste. Include:

1. An explanation of how the kidneys function to maintain fluid balance
2. The importance of proper hydration in the Timorese climate
3. Nutritional recommendations for maintaining kidney health
4. Common signs of dehydration and kidney problems
5. Local foods that support kidney health
6. Cultural considerations for dietary advice in Timor-Leste

Use simple language appropriate for patient education. Include visuals or diagrams to illustrate key points.

# Assignment Details

## Research Report

Write a one-page report on a common digestive or urinary system disorder in Timor-Leste. Include:

1. Description of the disorder and its prevalence in Timor-Leste
2. Causes and risk factors relevant to the Timorese population
3. Symptoms and diagnostic methods
4. Treatment options available in Timor-Leste
5. Prevention strategies suitable for local communities

Use at least three reputable sources, including local health statistics if available.

## Digestive System Model

Create a model of the digestive system using local foods. Guidelines:

1. Use foods to represent different organs (e.g., banana for stomach, noodles for intestines)
2. Label each "organ" with its name and primary function
3. Include at least 6 major digestive organs
4. Be prepared to explain how each part contributes to digestion
5. Consider how to represent accessory organs (liver, pancreas, gallbladder)

# Additional Materials

## Urinalysis Lab Simulation Instructions

1. Obtain a sample of "urine" (colored water with various solutes)
2. Use urinalysis test strips to test for:
   - pH
   - Protein
   - Glucose
   - Ketones
   - Blood
3. Record results in a table
4. Compare results to normal values
5. Discuss what abnormal results might indicate about kidney function

## Key Vocabulary Flashcards

Create flashcards for each key term:
- Peristalsis
- Enzymes
- Absorption
- Nephron
- Filtration
- Homeostasis

Include the definition and a simple diagram or example on each card.

## Case Study: Dehydration in Rural Timor-Leste

Maria, a 45-year-old farmer from a rural village, comes to the clinic complaining of fatigue, decreased urine output, and dark urine. She works long hours in the sun and admits to not drinking much water during the day.

Questions for discussion:
1. What signs and symptoms suggest Maria might be dehydrated?
2. How could chronic dehydration affect Maria's digestive and urinary systems?
3. What advice would you give Maria to improve her hydration status?
4. How might you adapt your advice to fit Maria's daily routine and local resources?
5. What potential complications could arise if Maria's dehydration is not addressed?
