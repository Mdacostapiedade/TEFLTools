## 1. Lecture Notes

### Overview of Global and Timor-Leste Aquaculture

#### Global Aquaculture
- Aquaculture is the fastest-growing food production sector globally
- In 2018, global aquaculture production reached 114.5 million tonnes (FAO, 2020)
- Asia dominates aquaculture production, accounting for 89% of global volume
- Major species groups: finfish (54.3 million tonnes), molluscs (17.7 million tonnes), crustaceans (9.4 million tonnes)

#### Timor-Leste Aquaculture
- Aquaculture in Timor-Leste is still in its early stages of development
- Main species cultured: tilapia, milkfish, and seaweed
- Challenges: limited technical knowledge, lack of infrastructure, underdeveloped value chains
- Opportunities: extensive coastline, suitable climate, government support for sector development

### Principles of Sustainable Aquaculture

1. Environmental Sustainability
   - Minimize environmental impacts (e.g., habitat destruction, pollution)
   - Maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functions
   - Use resources efficiently (e.g., water, feed, energy)

2. Economic Sustainability
   - Ensure long-term economic viability of aquaculture operations
   - Contribute to local and national economies
   - Promote fair trade and market access

3. Social Sustainability
   - Provide employment and livelihood opportunities
   - Ensure food security and nutrition
   - Respect local communities and traditional practices

### Introduction to the Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture (EAA)

#### Definition
The EAA is a strategy for the integration of aquaculture within the wider ecosystem in such a way that it promotes sustainable development, equity, and resilience of interlinked social and ecological systems.

#### Key Principles of EAA
1. Aquaculture development and management should consider the full range of ecosystem functions and services
2. Aquaculture should improve human well-being and equity for all relevant stakeholders
3. Aquaculture should be developed in the context of other sectors, policies, and goals

#### Implementation of EAA
- Spatial planning and zoning
- Carrying capacity assessment
- Environmental impact assessment
- Risk analysis and management
- Stakeholder participation and conflict resolution

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How does aquaculture contribute to global food security and economic development?
2. What are the main challenges and opportunities for aquaculture development in Timor-Leste?
3. How can the principles of sustainable aquaculture be applied to small-scale fish farming in rural areas?
4. What are the potential conflicts between aquaculture and other coastal activities, and how can these be managed?
5. How does the Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture differ from traditional aquaculture management approaches?
6. What role can traditional knowledge play in developing sustainable aquaculture practices in Timor-Leste?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. The importance of sustainable aquaculture for food security in developing countries
2. Challenges and opportunities for implementing the Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture in Timor-Leste
3. The role of aquaculture in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals

Your essay should include:
- An introduction stating your main argument
- At least three supporting points with examples
- A conclusion summarizing your key points and restating your main argument
- Proper citations for any sources used (APA format)

## 4. Assignment Details

### Case Study Analysis

1. Form groups of 3-4 students
2. Each group will be assigned a case study of a successful sustainable aquaculture project
3. Read and analyze the case study, focusing on:
   - The sustainability principles applied
   - The challenges faced and how they were overcome
   - The environmental, economic, and social impacts of the project
4. Prepare a 10-minute presentation on your findings
5. Be prepared to answer questions from the class and instructor

### Homework Assignment

Research and write a 500-word report on a specific type of aquaculture that could be suitable for Timor-Leste, considering sustainability principles. Your report should include:

1. A brief description of the aquaculture type (e.g., species, production system)
2. Why this type of aquaculture is suitable for Timor-Leste (consider climate, geography, local resources)
3. How it aligns with sustainability principles and the Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture
4. Potential challenges and how they might be addressed
5. Expected benefits for food security and economic development in Timor-Leste

## 5. Additional Materials

### Case Study Example: Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) in Canada

Cooke Aquaculture, in partnership with researchers from the University of New Brunswick, has implemented an IMTA system in the Bay of Fundy. This system combines the cultivation of Atlantic salmon with kelp and blue mussels.

Key points:
- Kelp and mussels act as biofilters, absorbing excess nutrients from salmon farming
- Multiple species provide diversified products and income streams
- System demonstrates improved environmental performance and social acceptance

Students can use this example to understand how sustainable aquaculture principles can be applied in practice.
