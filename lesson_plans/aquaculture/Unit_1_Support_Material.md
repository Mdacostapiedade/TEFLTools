## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Three Pillars of Sustainability Diagram**
   Description: A triangle diagram with "Sustainability" at the center and the three pillars (Environmental, Economic, and Social) at each corner. Arrows connecting the pillars illustrate their interdependence.

2. **Global Aquaculture Production Graph**
   Description: A line graph showing the increase in global aquaculture production over the past 30 years, with separate lines for different types of aquaculture (e.g., freshwater fish, marine fish, crustaceans, mollusks).

3. **Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture Infographic**
   Description: A circular diagram with "EAA" at the center, surrounded by its key principles (e.g., ecosystem services, stakeholder participation, adaptive management) and connected to icons representing different aspects of aquaculture and the environment.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Case Study Analysis Worksheet**
   Content: Provide a brief description of a successful sustainable aquaculture project. Include sections for students to identify:
   - Key sustainability principles applied
   - Challenges faced and how they were overcome
   - Environmental, economic, and social impacts
   - Lessons that could be applied to Timor-Leste

2. **Sustainable Aquaculture Principles Matching Activity**
   Content: Two columns - one with principles of sustainable aquaculture and another with examples or definitions. Students match the principles to their correct examples/definitions.

3. **Timor-Leste Aquaculture SWOT Analysis Template**
   Content: A template for students to fill out, analyzing the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats for aquaculture development in Timor-Leste.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited prior knowledge of aquaculture.
   **Solution**: Start with a basic introduction and use plenty of visual aids. Encourage questions and create a safe environment for learning.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in relating global concepts to the local context of Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Use local examples whenever possible. Invite guest speakers from local aquaculture projects or government agencies.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with the technical vocabulary.
   **Solution**: Provide a glossary of terms and use vocabulary games or activities to reinforce learning.

4. **Challenge**: Limited access to technology for research or presentations.
   **Solution**: Prepare printed materials in advance and focus on group discussions and hands-on activities that don't require technology.

5. **Challenge**: Varying levels of English proficiency among students.
   **Solution**: Use simple language, provide written materials to accompany oral presentations, and encourage peer support for translation when necessary.

6. **Challenge**: Students may have misconceptions about aquaculture practices.
   **Solution**: Address common misconceptions directly and use evidence-based information to correct them. Encourage critical thinking and questioning.
