Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 2: Spatial Planning for Aquaculture, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Spatial Planning for Aquaculture

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with GIS software (e.g., QGIS)
- Projector and screen
- Printed maps of Timor-Leste
- Colored markers and sticky notes
- Handouts on site selection criteria
- "Aquaculture zoning, site selection and area management under the ecosystem approach to aquaculture" by FAO

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the importance of spatial planning in aquaculture development
- Identify key factors in national-level scoping and feasibility assessments
- Describe the process of regional-level zoning for aquaculture activities
- Apply site selection criteria for aquaculture farms
- Create a basic spatial plan for aquaculture development

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a map of Timor-Leste
- Ask groups to brainstorm and mark potential areas for aquaculture development based on their current knowledge
- Discuss as a class, highlighting the need for systematic spatial planning

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Spatial planning
- Zoning
- Carrying capacity
- Stakeholder engagement
- Environmental impact assessment
- Geographic Information System (GIS)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

1. Importance of spatial planning in aquaculture
   - Sustainable resource use
   - Conflict prevention
   - Optimizing production

2. National-level scoping and feasibility assessments
   - Resource mapping
   - Identifying potential conflicts
   - Assessing infrastructure needs

3. Regional-level zoning of activities
   - Multi-use zoning concepts
   - Integrating aquaculture with other coastal activities
   - Using GIS for zoning

4. Site selection criteria for aquaculture farms
   - Water quality parameters
   - Environmental considerations
   - Socio-economic factors
   - Infrastructure and logistics

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Divide class into pairs
- Provide each pair with a hypothetical region and its characteristics
- Ask pairs to apply site selection criteria to identify suitable areas for aquaculture
- Have pairs present their findings to the class

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

Mapping exercise:
- Using GIS software, guide students through the process of creating a basic aquaculture zoning map for a region in Timor-Leste
- Include layers for water bodies, infrastructure, protected areas, and existing land use

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points of spatial planning for aquaculture
- Address any questions or misconceptions
- Preview the upcoming group project on developing a spatial plan

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Begin research for the group project: Develop a spatial plan for a hypothetical aquaculture development in Timor-Leste
- Read Chapter 3 of "Aquaculture zoning, site selection and area management under the ecosystem approach to aquaculture" by FAO

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Spatial planning: The process of organizing the use of spaces and the interactions between people and their environment
- Zoning: The practice of dividing land into sections for different uses
- Carrying capacity: The maximum population size that an environment can sustain indefinitely
- Stakeholder engagement: The process of involving relevant parties in planning and decision-making
- Environmental impact assessment: Evaluation of the potential environmental effects of a proposed project
- Geographic Information System (GIS): A computer system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on Earth's surface
