Here are the support materials for the Spatial Planning for Aquaculture lesson plan:

# Support Materials for Spatial Planning for Aquaculture Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Spatial planning**: The process of organizing the use of spaces and the interactions between people and their environment
- **Zoning**: The practice of dividing land into sections for different uses
- **Carrying capacity**: The maximum population size that an environment can sustain indefinitely
- **Stakeholder engagement**: The process of involving relevant parties in planning and decision-making
- **Environmental impact assessment**: Evaluation of the potential environmental effects of a proposed project
- **Geographic Information System (GIS)**: A computer system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on Earth's surface
- **Aquaculture**: The farming of aquatic organisms, including fish, mollusks, crustaceans, and aquatic plants
- **Ecosystem approach to aquaculture (EAA)**: A strategy for the integration of aquaculture within the wider ecosystem in a way that promotes sustainable development, equity, and resilience of interlinked social and ecological systems

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Aquaculture Zoning Map**:
   Describe a color-coded map of Timor-Leste showing:
   - Blue areas for potential marine aquaculture zones
   - Green areas for potential freshwater aquaculture zones
   - Red areas for protected or restricted zones
   - Yellow areas for existing aquaculture sites
   - Gray areas for urban or developed land

2. **Site Selection Criteria Flowchart**:
   Describe a flowchart illustrating the decision-making process for site selection, including:
   - Water quality assessment
   - Environmental considerations
   - Infrastructure availability
   - Socio-economic factors
   - Legal and regulatory compliance

3. **GIS Layers Diagram**:
   Describe a visual representation of GIS layers used in aquaculture spatial planning:
   - Base map layer
   - Water bodies layer
   - Land use layer
   - Infrastructure layer
   - Environmental sensitivity layer
   - Aquaculture suitability layer

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Site Selection Criteria Checklist**:
   Create a checklist of important factors to consider when selecting an aquaculture site, including:
   - Water quality parameters (pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, etc.)
   - Topography and soil type
   - Proximity to water sources
   - Distance from pollution sources
   - Accessibility and infrastructure
   - Legal and social considerations

2. **Spatial Planning Exercise Worksheet**:
   Design a worksheet that guides students through the process of creating a basic spatial plan for aquaculture development in a hypothetical region. Include:
   - A blank map of the region
   - List of regional characteristics (e.g., water bodies, protected areas, urban centers)
   - Step-by-step instructions for identifying and marking suitable aquaculture zones

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. FAO Technical Paper: "Spatial planning for sustainable aquaculture development"
2. World Bank Report: "Sustainable Aquaculture Development in Southeast Asia"
3. Online GIS tutorial: "Introduction to QGIS for Aquaculture Planning"
4. Journal article: "Integrating Ecosystem Services in Aquaculture Spatial Planning"
5. Webinar series: "Best Practices in Aquaculture Zoning and Site Selection"

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with GIS software
   **Solution**: Provide step-by-step tutorials and consider pairing tech-savvy students with those who need more support

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in applying theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios
   **Solution**: Use case studies from Timor-Leste or similar regions to illustrate practical applications of spatial planning concepts

3. **Challenge**: Balancing different stakeholder interests in spatial planning exercises
   **Solution**: Conduct role-playing activities where students represent different stakeholders to understand various perspectives

4. **Challenge**: Limited local data for Timor-Leste
   **Solution**: Supplement with data from similar regions and encourage students to identify data gaps as part of their learning process

5. **Challenge**: Maintaining student engagement during technical presentations
   **Solution**: Incorporate interactive elements, such as quick polls or short group discussions, throughout the presentation
