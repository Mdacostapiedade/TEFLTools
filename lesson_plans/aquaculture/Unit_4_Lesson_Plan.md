Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 4: Disease Prevention and Control, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Disease Prevention and Control in Aquaculture

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on common aquaculture diseases
- Biosecurity equipment samples (e.g., disinfectants, protective gear)
- Role-playing scenario cards
- Whiteboard and markers

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify common diseases in aquaculture systems
- Understand the importance of biosecurity in disease prevention
- Develop a basic biosecurity plan for an aquaculture farm
- Demonstrate appropriate responses to a disease outbreak scenario

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show images of healthy and diseased fish
- Ask students to identify differences and discuss potential causes of the diseases

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Pathogen
- Biosecurity
- Quarantine
- Vector
- Epidemiology

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### 5.1 Common Diseases in Aquaculture
- Viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases
- Signs and symptoms
- Economic impact of diseases

### 5.2 Biosecurity Measures
- Definition and importance of biosecurity
- Key components of a biosecurity plan
- Preventive measures (e.g., quarantine, water treatment)

### 5.3 Coordinated Disease Control Strategies
- Early detection and reporting systems
- Collaborative approaches to disease management
- Government and industry roles in disease control

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Group activity: Identify potential biosecurity risks in a given farm layout
- Pair work: Match diseases with their symptoms and prevention methods

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

### 7.1 Develop a Biosecurity Plan (30 minutes)
- Students work in small groups to create a biosecurity plan for a hypothetical aquaculture farm
- Groups present their plans to the class for feedback

### 7.2 Role-playing Exercise (30 minutes)
- Divide class into groups and assign roles (farm manager, vet, government official)
- Present a disease outbreak scenario
- Groups act out their response and decision-making process

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Brief discussion on the importance of disease prevention in sustainable aquaculture

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research a specific aquaculture disease relevant to Timor-Leste
- Write a 2-page report on its symptoms, prevention, and control measures

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Pathogen: A bacterium, virus, or other microorganism that can cause disease
- Biosecurity: Procedures intended to protect humans or animals against disease or harmful biological agents
- Quarantine: A state of isolation to prevent the spread of disease
- Vector: An organism that transmits a disease or parasite from one animal or plant to another
- Epidemiology: The study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why
