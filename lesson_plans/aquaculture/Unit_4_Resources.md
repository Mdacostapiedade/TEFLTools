# Resources for Learning Unit 4: Disease Prevention and Control

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Common Diseases in Aquaculture

#### Viral Diseases
- Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA)
  * Caused by Orthomyxovirus
  * Symptoms: lethargy, pale gills, hemorrhaging in internal organs
  * Primarily affects Atlantic salmon
- Viral Nervous Necrosis (VNN)
  * Caused by Betanodavirus
  * Symptoms: abnormal swimming behavior, darkening of skin
  * Affects various marine fish species

#### Bacterial Diseases
- Furunculosis
  * Caused by Aeromonas salmonicida
  * Symptoms: skin ulcers, loss of appetite, internal hemorrhaging
  * Affects various freshwater and marine species
- Vibriosis
  * Caused by Vibrio species
  * Symptoms: skin lesions, hemorrhaging, exophthalmia
  * Common in marine and brackish water aquaculture

#### Parasitic Diseases
- Sea Lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis)
  * External parasite affecting salmon
  * Causes skin lesions, reduced growth, and increased susceptibility to other diseases
- White Spot Disease (Ichthyophthirius multifiliis)
  * Protozoan parasite affecting freshwater fish
  * Symptoms: white cysts on skin and gills, increased mucus production

### Biosecurity Measures

#### Definition and Importance
- Biosecurity: Set of preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases
- Importance:
  * Protects fish stock health
  * Maintains production efficiency
  * Prevents economic losses
  * Ensures food safety

#### Key Components of a Biosecurity Plan
1. Access control
2. Sanitation and disinfection protocols
3. Water quality management
4. Stock health monitoring
5. Feed and equipment management
6. Waste management
7. Staff training and hygiene practices

#### Preventive Measures
- Quarantine procedures for new stock
- Regular health checks and disease screening
- Proper disposal of dead fish
- Vaccination programs
- Stress reduction strategies

### Coordinated Disease Control Strategies

#### Early Detection and Reporting Systems
- Regular health monitoring and record-keeping
- Rapid diagnostic techniques (e.g., PCR, ELISA)
- Established reporting channels to relevant authorities

#### Collaborative Approaches
- Information sharing between farms and regions
- Coordinated treatment efforts for area-wide disease control
- Joint research initiatives for disease prevention and control

#### Government and Industry Roles
- Government:
  * Establish and enforce regulations
  * Provide disease surveillance and monitoring
  * Coordinate emergency response plans
- Industry:
  * Implement biosecurity measures
  * Participate in voluntary disease control programs
  * Invest in research and development for disease prevention

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How do environmental factors contribute to disease outbreaks in aquaculture systems?
2. What are the potential economic impacts of a major disease outbreak in an aquaculture farm?
3. How can small-scale farmers in Timor-Leste implement effective biosecurity measures with limited resources?
4. Discuss the ethical considerations of using antibiotics in aquaculture for disease prevention and treatment.
5. How might climate change affect the prevalence and distribution of aquaculture diseases in the future?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. The importance of biosecurity in sustainable aquaculture development
2. Challenges and opportunities for disease control in Timor-Leste's aquaculture sector
3. The role of technology in improving disease prevention and control in aquaculture

Your essay should include:
- An introduction stating your main argument
- At least three supporting points with examples
- A conclusion summarizing your key points and restating your argument

## 4. Assignment Details

### Biosecurity Plan Development

In groups of 3-4, develop a comprehensive biosecurity plan for a hypothetical tilapia farm in Timor-Leste. Your plan should include:

1. Farm layout and access control measures
2. Sanitation and disinfection protocols
3. Water quality management strategies
4. Stock health monitoring procedures
5. Feed and equipment management
6. Waste management plan
7. Staff training program

Present your plan in a 10-minute presentation to the class, followed by a 5-minute Q&A session.

### Disease Outbreak Role-playing Exercise

Students will be divided into groups and assigned roles (farm manager, veterinarian, government official, etc.). Each group will receive a scenario card describing a disease outbreak situation. Groups will have 20 minutes to discuss and plan their response, then 10 minutes to act out their decision-making process and actions.

Example scenario:
"Your tilapia farm has experienced sudden mortalities, with 20% of fish showing signs of lethargy and skin lesions. Initial tests suggest a bacterial infection, but results are not conclusive. How do you respond to contain the potential outbreak and minimize losses?"

## 5. Additional Materials

### Case Study: White Spot Disease Outbreak in Australian Prawn Farms (2016)

In December 2016, White Spot Disease was detected in prawn farms in Southeast Queensland, Australia. This case study examines the outbreak, its economic impact, and the response measures taken by the industry and government.

Key points:
- Rapid spread of the disease across multiple farms
- Implementation of movement restrictions and enhanced biosecurity measures
- Destruction of infected stock to prevent further spread
- Economic losses estimated at over $40 million
- Long-term impacts on the industry and lessons learned for future preparedness

### Biosecurity Equipment Checklist

- Personal protective equipment (PPE):
  * Disposable gloves
  * Waterproof boots
  * Protective clothing (e.g., coveralls)
  * Face masks
- Disinfection equipment:
  * Foot baths
  * Hand sanitizer stations
  * Pressure washers
  * Disinfectant sprayers
- Quarantine facilities:
  * Isolation tanks
  * Separate water systems
  * Dedicated equipment for quarantine areas
- Water treatment systems:
  * UV sterilizers
  * Ozone generators
  * Filtration systems
- Monitoring equipment:
  * Water quality test kits
  * Microscopes for parasite detection
  * Rapid test kits for common diseases

This comprehensive set of resources should provide a solid foundation for teaching Learning Unit 4 on Disease Prevention and Control in Aquaculture.
