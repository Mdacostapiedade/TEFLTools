2. Aquaculture value chain diagram:
   - A flowchart illustrating the stages from input supplies to production, processing, distribution, and consumption of aquaculture products in Timor-Leste

3. Sustainable aquaculture practices infographic:
   - A visual representation of key sustainable practices such as water recirculation, integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, and mangrove conservation

4. Stakeholder engagement diagram:
   - A circular diagram showing the various stakeholders involved in aquaculture development (e.g., government, local communities, NGOs, private sector) and their interconnections

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

2. Sustainable Aquaculture Development Plan Template:
   - A structured outline for students to use when developing their group plans
   - Sections: Regional overview, Environmental assessment, Socio-economic conditions, Infrastructure analysis, Proposed species for cultivation, Sustainable practices to implement, Stakeholder engagement strategy, Monitoring and evaluation plan

3. Case Study Comparison Chart:
   - A chart for students to compare successful aquaculture development cases from other countries with the situation in Timor-Leste
   - Columns: Country, Type of aquaculture, Key success factors, Challenges overcome, Lessons for Timor-Leste

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. FAO Technical Paper: "Aquaculture zoning, site selection and area management under the ecosystem approach to aquaculture"
2. World Bank Report: "Sustainable Aquaculture Development in Southeast Asia"
3. Journal Article: "Challenges and opportunities for sustainable aquaculture in developing countries" (Fisheries Science)
4. Online Course: "Sustainable Aquaculture" by Wageningen University on edX
5. Webinar Series: "Best Practices in Aquaculture Management" by The Fish Site

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited student knowledge of Timor-Leste's geography and current aquaculture practices
   - Solution: Provide a brief overview of Timor-Leste's geography and current aquaculture sector at the beginning of the lesson. Use visual aids like maps and infographics to enhance understanding.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in applying global sustainable aquaculture concepts to the local context
   - Solution: Use case studies from similar developing countries and encourage students to draw parallels with Timor-Leste. Invite local aquaculture experts as guest speakers to provide context.

3. Challenge: Students struggling with policy analysis
   - Solution: Provide a step-by-step guide for policy analysis and work through an example as a class before assigning the pair work.

4. Challenge: Uneven participation in group work
   - Solution: Assign specific roles within each group (e.g., researcher, writer, presenter) and rotate these roles for different activities to ensure all students are engaged.

5. Challenge: Time management during the production task
   - Solution: Provide a clear timeline for each component of the development plan. Use a visible timer and give regular time updates to keep groups on track.

6. Challenge: Difficulty in understanding technical aquaculture terms
   - Solution: Create a visual glossary with illustrations for key terms and refer to it throughout the lesson. Encourage students to use these terms in their discussions and presentations.
