# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "The Hidden Gospel of the Aramaic Jesus" by Neil Douglas-Klotz

In the beginning was the Word. But what was this Word, and how could it be said? The Gospel of John starts with a set of statements about the Word, the Logos, which are full of meaning in Greek but even fuller in Aramaic. In Aramaic, the word for "word" is miltha, which can mean "word," "emanation," "frequency," or even the "active manifestation of a force." So in Aramaic, the Gospel begins:

In the beginning was the Miltha
And the Miltha was with Allaha
And the Miltha was Allaha.

This was in the beginning with Allaha.
All things happened through it,
And without it not one thing happened.

What happened was life,
And the life was the light of humanity.
And the light shines in the darkness,
And the darkness does not overcome it.

In this Aramaic version, we can see a different picture emerging. The Miltha is not just a word, but an active force, an emanation of the divine. This force is both with God (Allaha) and is God. It is through this force that all things come into being, and this force is life itself, shining as light in the darkness.

# Lecture Notes

## 1. Early Christian Diversity

- Christianity in the first three centuries was not a monolithic entity
- Various groups interpreted Jesus' teachings differently
- Major divisions:
  * Jewish Christians: Continued to follow Jewish law
  * Gentile Christians: Rejected Jewish law
  * Gnostics: Emphasized secret knowledge for salvation
  * Docetists: Believed Jesus only appeared to be human
  * Adoptionists: Believed Jesus was adopted as God's son at baptism
- Diversity in practices, beliefs about Jesus' nature, and interpretation of scriptures
- No single "orthodox" Christianity until later centuries

## 2. The Council of Nicaea

- Convened by Emperor Constantine in 325 CE
- Purpose: To resolve disputes in the church, particularly about the nature of Jesus
- Main issue: Arian controversy (Was Jesus divine or created?)
- Outcome: Nicene Creed
  * Affirmed Jesus as "true God from true God"
  * Established the doctrine of the Trinity
- Impact:
  * Defined "orthodox" Christianity
  * Led to suppression of alternative views
  * Standardized Christian doctrine across the Roman Empire

## 3. Introduction to Aramaic Christianity

- Aramaic: Language spoken by Jesus and his early followers
- Characteristics of Aramaic Christianity:
  * Emphasis on the unity of all things
  * Holistic view of spirituality and nature
  * Multilayered interpretations of teachings
  * Focus on experiential spirituality
- Differences from Western Christianity:
  * Less emphasis on dogma and creeds
  * More poetic and metaphorical interpretations of scripture
  * Greater focus on the present moment and personal transformation
- Preservation in Eastern Christian traditions (e.g., Syriac Christianity)

# Discussion Questions

1. How might the diversity of early Christianity challenge our understanding of religious orthodoxy?
2. In what ways do you think language shapes religious understanding? How might Jesus' teachings be understood differently in Aramaic versus Greek or Latin?
3. Can you identify any parallels between early Christian diversity and the variety of spiritual traditions in Timor-Leste?
4. How do you think the Council of Nicaea's decisions have influenced modern Christianity? What might be different if alternative views had prevailed?
5. What aspects of Aramaic Christianity resonate with Timorese spiritual traditions? Are there any significant differences?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a reflective essay (500-750 words) on the following prompt:

Imagine you are a member of an early Christian community in the 2nd century CE. Describe your community's beliefs and practices, and how they differ from other Christian groups you've encountered. Consider:
- Your group's understanding of Jesus' nature and teachings
- Key rituals or practices
- Relationship with Jewish traditions
- Views on salvation and the afterlife

Use information from the lecture and readings to inform your creative writing, but feel free to use your imagination to fill in details.
