# Excerpts and Short Stories

## "The Hidden Gospel of the Aramaic Jesus" by Neil Douglas-Klotz

### Excerpt 1: Introduction to Aramaic Language

The Aramaic language, like its sister Semitic languages of Hebrew and Arabic, is based on roots that usually consist of three consonants. These roots can then be vocalized with various vowel patterns and extended with prefixes and suffixes to create a wide range of related meanings. This system allows for a richness and depth of meaning that is often lost in translation to non-Semitic languages.

For instance, the Aramaic word "abwoon" (often translated simply as "father" in the Lord's Prayer) carries within it connotations of "that which gives birth to all things," "the source of all creation," and "the divine parent." This multifaceted meaning reflects the Aramaic worldview of interconnectedness and unity.

### Excerpt 2: The Concept of Unity (Alaha)

In Aramaic thought, the concept of unity, or "Alaha," is central to understanding the nature of reality. Unlike the Western notion of a separate, personified deity, Alaha represents the indivisible oneness that permeates all of existence. It is not merely a religious concept but a fundamental principle that governs the relationship between humans, nature, and the divine.

The Aramaic Jesus often spoke of this unity, encouraging his listeners to recognize their inherent connection to all of creation. This perspective challenges the dualistic thinking that separates the sacred from the profane, the spiritual from the material, and humans from nature.

# Lecture Notes

## Introduction to Aramaic Language Structure

1. Root-based system
   - Most words derived from three-consonant roots
   - Vowel patterns and affixes modify meaning
   - Example: K-T-B root (related to writing)
     * KTaB - he wrote
     * KTaBa - book
     * KaToBa - writer

2. Importance of context
   - Words often have multiple related meanings
   - Context crucial for accurate interpretation
   - Example: "Shalom" (peace, wholeness, well-being)

3. Poetic and metaphorical nature
   - Rich in imagery and symbolism
   - Encourages multiple levels of interpretation
   - Example: "Kingdom of Heaven" as internal state and external reality

## Semitic Cosmology and Psychology

1. Interconnectedness of inner and outer worlds
   - No strict separation between physical and spiritual
   - Human psyche seen as microcosm of the universe
   - Actions in one realm affect the other

2. Cyclical view of time and events
   - Emphasis on patterns and recurring themes
   - Present moment as intersection of past and future

3. Holistic approach to health and well-being
   - Physical, emotional, and spiritual health intertwined
   - Healing involves restoring balance to whole person

4. Community-based worldview
   - Individual identity rooted in community relationships
   - Emphasis on collective responsibility and shared destiny

## The Concept of Unity in Aramaic Thought

1. Alaha as indivisible oneness
   - Not a separate deity but the essence of all existence
   - Transcends and includes all apparent dualities

2. Unity of creation
   - All aspects of nature seen as expressions of divine unity
   - Humans as integral part of the natural world

3. Non-dualistic perspective
   - Challenges binary thinking (good vs. evil, spirit vs. matter)
   - Encourages recognition of underlying unity in diversity

4. Practical implications
   - Ethical behavior rooted in recognition of interconnectedness
   - Spiritual practices aimed at experiencing unity directly
