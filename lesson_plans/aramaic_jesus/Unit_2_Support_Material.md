## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barrier**: Students may struggle with Aramaic concepts and pronunciation.
   - Solution: Provide audio recordings and focus on a few key terms rather than overwhelming students with too much vocabulary.

2. **Cultural Differences**: Students may find it difficult to relate Aramaic concepts to Timorese spirituality.
   - Solution: Start with familiar Timorese concepts and gradually draw parallels to Aramaic ideas. Use local examples whenever possible.

3. **Abstract Concepts**: The idea of unity and interconnectedness may be challenging for some students.
   - Solution: Use concrete examples from nature and community life to illustrate these concepts. Encourage students to share their own experiences of interconnectedness.

4. **Lack of Prior Knowledge**: Students may have limited background in religious studies or linguistics.
   - Solution: Provide brief, clear explanations of basic concepts. Use visual aids and analogies to make ideas more accessible.

5. **Potential Religious Sensitivities**: Some students may feel uncomfortable exploring ideas from a different religious tradition.
   - Solution: Emphasize the academic and cultural nature of the study. Encourage open-mindedness and respect for diverse perspectives.

6. **Time Management**: Covering all aspects of the lesson plan within the allotted time may be challenging.
   - Solution: Prioritize key concepts and be prepared to adjust the lesson plan as needed. Consider extending some activities into follow-up lessons if necessary.
