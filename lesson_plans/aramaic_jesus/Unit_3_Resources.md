# Excerpts and Short Stories

## The "Good and Evil" Tree Parable (Matthew 7:17-18)

English:
"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit."

Tetum:
"Nuneʼe mós, ai-hun diʼak hotu fó fuan diʼak, maibé ai-hun aat fó fuan aat. Ai-hun diʼak labele fó fuan aat, no ai-hun aat labele fó fuan diʼak."

Aramaic (transliterated):
"Hakana kol ilan taba abed pire tabe. Ilan den bisha abed pire bishe. La meshkach ilan taba lmeabad pire bishe. Wela ilan bisha lmeabad pire tabe."

## Excerpt from "The Hidden Gospel of the Aramaic Jesus" by Neil Douglas-Klotz

"In Aramaic, the words traditionally translated as 'good' and 'evil' are 'taba' and 'bisha'. These words also mean 'ripe' and 'unripe'. So, we could understand Jesus as saying, 'A ripe tree cannot bear unripe fruit, and an unripe tree cannot bear ripe fruit.' This shifts our understanding from a dualistic view of good and evil to a more nuanced perspective of spiritual maturity and readiness."

# Lecture Notes

## Topic 1: The "Good and Evil" Tree Parable in Aramaic

1. Traditional interpretation:
   - Focus on moral dualism (good vs. evil)
   - Emphasis on judgment and separation

2. Aramaic interpretation:
   - 'Taba' (good) also means 'ripe', 'mature', 'ready'
   - 'Bisha' (evil) also means 'unripe', 'immature', 'not ready'
   - Shifts focus from moral judgment to spiritual growth and readiness

3. Implications:
   - Encourages personal growth rather than judgment of others
   - Suggests a cyclical view of spiritual development
   - Aligns with natural processes (fruit ripening)

4. Relevance to Timorese culture:
   - Connection to agricultural cycles and natural wisdom
   - Potential resonance with animistic beliefs

## Topic 2: Other Key Teachings and Their Aramaic Interpretations

1. The Lord's Prayer:
   - "Our Father" (Abwoon d'bwashmaya):
     * 'Abwoon': divine parent (beyond gender)
     * 'D'bwashmaya': of the cosmos, of all that vibrates
   - Implications: Inclusive, cosmic spirituality

2. "The Kingdom of Heaven" (Malkuta d'Shmaya):
   - 'Malkuta': kingdom, queendom, domain, realm
   - 'Shmaya': heaven, universe, cosmos
   - Interpretation: The realm of unity and cosmic consciousness

3. "Blessed are the poor in spirit" (Tubwayhun l'meskenaee b'rukh):
   - 'Meskenaee': those who maintain their inner breath/spirit in face of difficulty
   - Interpretation: Blessed are those who remain true to their essence despite challenges
