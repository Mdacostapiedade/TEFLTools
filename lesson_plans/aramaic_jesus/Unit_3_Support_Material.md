## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may feel their traditional beliefs are being challenged.
   **Solution**: Emphasize that this is an exploration, not a replacement. Encourage students to see these interpretations as additional perspectives rather than contradictions.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in grasping Aramaic concepts due to language barriers.
   **Solution**: Use plenty of visual aids and real-life examples. Relate Aramaic concepts to similar ideas in Timorese culture whenever possible.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to apply Aramaic concepts to Timorese proverbs.
   **Solution**: Provide a clear example and guide students through the process step-by-step. Encourage creativity and emphasize that there are no "wrong" interpretations.

4. **Challenge**: Potential resistance from more conservative students or community members.
   **Solution**: Frame the lesson as an academic exploration of historical interpretations, not as a challenge to current beliefs. Invite open dialogue and respect all viewpoints.

5. **Challenge**: Students may find it difficult to write reflections on the impact on Timorese spirituality.
   **Solution**: Provide a structured reflection guide with specific questions and prompts. Encourage students to draw from personal experiences and observations in their communities.
