# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "The Hidden Gospel of the Aramaic Jesus" by Neil Douglas-Klotz

"In Aramaic, the word for 'holy' (qadosh) is related to the words for 'set apart' and 'unique.' When Jesus speaks of the 'Holy Spirit' in Aramaic, he is referring to the Breath of Unity that connects all of creation. This Breath is not separate from nature but is the very essence that animates and unifies all living things.

The Aramaic worldview does not separate the spiritual from the physical. Instead, it sees all of creation as a sacred manifestation of the divine. When Jesus teaches using natural metaphors—speaking of seeds, trees, birds, and lilies—he is not simply using convenient illustrations. He is pointing to the inherent divinity within nature itself.

In this view, humans are not separate from or superior to nature, but are integral parts of a sacred whole. Our role is not to dominate creation, but to be conscious participants in its unfolding, to be stewards of its beauty and diversity."

# Additional Materials and Examples

## Images of Sacred Natural Sites in Timor-Leste

1. Mount Ramelau (Tatamailau) - Highest peak in Timor-Leste, considered sacred by many Timorese
2. Lake Ira Lalaro - Largest lake in Timor-Leste, home to unique ecosystems and local legends

4. Sacred Banyan Tree in Aileu - Ancient tree revered by local communities

## Example of Aramaic Prayer Connecting Nature and Community

"Abwoon d'bwashmaya" (Our Father in Heaven)
Aramaic translation: "O Birther! Father-Mother of the Cosmos, you create all that moves in light."

This opening line of the Lord's Prayer in Aramaic emphasizes the creative force of the divine as both father and mother, connecting it to the cosmos and light. It illustrates the Aramaic view of God as intimately connected with nature and the entire universe.

## Timorese Ritual: Tara Bandu

Tara Bandu is a traditional Timorese practice that involves placing a ritual prohibition on certain natural resources to regulate their use and promote conservation. This practice demonstrates the interconnectedness of spirituality, nature, and community in Timorese culture.

Key elements of Tara Bandu:
1. Community agreement on resource management
2. Ritual ceremony involving local leaders and spiritual authorities
3. Physical markers (e.g., palm leaves) to indicate prohibited areas
4. Spiritual beliefs in consequences for violating the prohibition
5. Regular community meetings to assess and adjust the practice

This example can be used to discuss similarities and differences with Aramaic Christian approaches to environmental stewardship and community-based spiritual practices.
