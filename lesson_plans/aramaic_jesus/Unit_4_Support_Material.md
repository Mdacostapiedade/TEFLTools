## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may struggle to connect ancient Aramaic concepts with modern Timorese life.
   Solution: Consistently draw parallels and encourage students to share personal experiences that relate to the concepts discussed.

2. Challenge: Language barrier in understanding Aramaic terms.
   Solution: Provide phonetic pronunciations and multiple translations/interpretations for key Aramaic words. Use visual aids to reinforce meanings.

3. Challenge: Sensitivity around discussing different religious traditions.
   Solution: Establish ground rules for respectful discussion. Emphasize the academic nature of the course and the value of understanding diverse perspectives.

4. Challenge: Difficulty in abstract thinking required for reinterpreting teachings.
   Solution: Start with simple, concrete examples. Gradually introduce more complex concepts. Use group work to allow peer learning and support.

5. Challenge: Balancing academic study with spiritual exploration.
   Solution: Clearly differentiate between academic analysis and personal spiritual practice. Encourage reflection but make it clear that personal beliefs are not being evaluated.

6. Challenge: Limited access to Aramaic resources in Timor-Leste.
   Solution: Prepare comprehensive handouts and translations. Consider creating a small library of key texts for student use. Utilize online resources when possible.
