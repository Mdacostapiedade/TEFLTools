2. Develop strategies for applying Aramaic Christian concepts in a Timorese context
3. Articulate connections between ancient wisdom and contemporary challenges
4. Propose solutions to local issues using Aramaic Christian principles

## Warm-up Activity (15 minutes)

1. Divide the class into small groups of 3-4 students.
2. Provide each group with a current environmental issue facing Timor-Leste (e.g., deforestation, water scarcity, coastal erosion).
3. Ask groups to brainstorm potential solutions based on their current knowledge and beliefs.
4. Have each group briefly share their ideas with the class.

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (20 minutes)

1. Present the following key terms and their definitions:
   - Ecological stewardship
   - Interconnectedness
   - Sacred unity
   - Ripeness (in Aramaic context)
   - Earth-based spirituality
2. Provide examples of how these concepts appear in Aramaic thought and Timorese traditions.
3. Conduct a quick matching activity where students connect the terms to their definitions and examples.

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

1. Lecture on ecological perspectives in Aramaic thought:
   - The concept of unity between the divine, humanity, and nature

   - The role of spirituality in environmental conservation
   - Potential synergies between Aramaic Christianity and Timorese spiritual practices

## Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Jigsaw reading activity:

   - Groups read and discuss their excerpt, focusing on ecological implications
   - Regroup and share insights with the class

2. Case study analysis:
   - Present a local environmental challenge in Timor-Leste
   - In pairs, students analyze the issue using Aramaic Christian concepts
   - Pairs share their analysis with the class

## Production Tasks (60 minutes)

1. Debate: "How can Aramaic Christian concepts address Timorese environmental challenges?"
   - Divide class into two teams: one arguing for the relevance of Aramaic concepts, the other challenging their applicability
   - Allow time for preparation and conduct a structured debate
   - Class votes on the most convincing arguments

2. Individual project initiation:
   - Students begin work on their individual projects: "Propose a solution to a local issue using Aramaic Christian principles"
   - Provide guidance on project structure and expectations
   - Allow time for initial brainstorming and outlining

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

1. Conduct a quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
2. Facilitate a class discussion on the most surprising or impactful ideas learned
3. Preview the next lesson and how it builds on today's content

## Homework Assignment

1. Continue working on individual projects, developing a detailed proposal for addressing a local issue using Aramaic Christian principles
2. Read selected passages from "Animism, Colonialism and the Struggle for Existence in East Timor" by David Hicks, considering how Timorese spirituality might align with or differ from Aramaic Christian concepts
