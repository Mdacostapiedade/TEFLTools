# Excerpts and Short Stories

## "The Hidden Gospel of the Aramaic Jesus" by Neil Douglas-Klotz

### Excerpt 1: Unity of Creation

"In the Aramaic worldview, there is no separation between the divine, humanity, and nature. The word for 'creation' in Aramaic, 'bria,' implies a continuous process of unfolding and becoming. Jesus' teachings, when viewed through this lens, reveal a profound ecological wisdom that speaks of our interconnectedness with all living things."

### Excerpt 2: Stewardship and Ripeness

"The Aramaic concept of 'ripeness' or 'readiness' (qaribu) appears in many of Jesus' parables. When applied to our relationship with the Earth, it suggests that we must cultivate a state of readiness to act as stewards of creation, always attuned to the rhythms and needs of the natural world."

## "Prayers of the Cosmos" by Neil Douglas-Klotz

### Excerpt: The Lord's Prayer in Aramaic

"O Birther! Father-Mother of the Cosmos,
Focus your light within us - make it useful:
Create your reign of unity now-
Your one desire then acts with ours,
as in all light, so in all forms.
Grant what we need each day in bread and insight.
Loose the cords of mistakes binding us,
as we release the strands we hold of others' guilt.
Don't let surface things delude us,
But free us from what holds us back.
From you is born all ruling will,
the power and the life to do,
the song that beautifies all,
from age to age it renews.
Truly - power to these statements -
may they be the ground from which all
my actions grow: Amen."

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Deforestation in Timor-Leste

Background: Timor-Leste has experienced significant deforestation due to various factors, including slash-and-burn agriculture, illegal logging, and fuel wood collection.

Aramaic Christian Perspective:
1. Unity of creation: Forests as integral to the divine-human-nature relationship

2. Traditional forest management practices
3. Spiritual beliefs related to trees and forests

Discussion Points:
1. How can Aramaic Christian concepts complement Timorese traditional knowledge in addressing deforestation?
2. What specific actions could be taken that align with both perspectives?
3. How might this integrated approach differ from purely economic or scientific solutions?
