# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Space-Based Astronomy

## Resources Needed
- Computer with projector
- Internet access
- Whiteboard and markers
- Printed handouts on major space telescopes
- Materials for building simple telescope models (cardboard tubes, lenses)

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain at least three limitations of ground-based astronomy
2. Describe three advantages of space-based observations
3. Identify three major space telescopes and their key contributions

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Show images of Earth from space and ask students to brainstorm what they can see and what might be challenging to observe from the ground
- List responses on the whiteboard

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)
- Space-based astronomy
- Atmospheric interference
- Electromagnetic spectrum
- Space telescope

## Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Brief history of space-based astronomy
   - First satellite observations
   - Launch of Hubble Space Telescope
2. Limitations of ground-based astronomy
   - Atmospheric absorption and distortion
   - Light pollution
   - Weather constraints
3. Advantages of space-based observations
   - Unobstructed view of the universe
   - Access to full electromagnetic spectrum
   - Continuous observation capabilities
4. Overview of major space telescopes
   - Hubble Space Telescope
   - Chandra X-ray Observatory
   - James Webb Space Telescope

## Practice Activities (20 minutes)
1. Small group discussions: Assign each group a different space telescope to research and present key facts about
2. Whole class activity: Create a timeline of major space-based astronomy milestones

## Production Task (25 minutes)
- Students work in pairs to design and build a simple model of a space telescope using provided materials
- Each pair presents their model, explaining its key features and potential observations it could make

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
- Class discussion: How has space-based astronomy changed our understanding of the universe?
- Quick quiz: Students answer 3-5 multiple choice questions about the lesson content

## Homework Assignment
- Research and write a one-page report on a recent discovery made by a space telescope
- Prepare a list of questions about potential benefits of space science for Timor Leste (for next lesson's group discussion)

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Space-based astronomy: The practice of observing celestial objects from instruments placed in outer space
- Atmospheric interference: The distortion and absorption of light and other electromagnetic radiation by Earth's atmosphere
- Electromagnetic spectrum: The range of all types of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays
- Space telescope: An telescope placed in orbit around Earth or at a special point in space, designed to observe distant planets, galaxies, and other celestial objects
