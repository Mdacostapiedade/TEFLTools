## History of Space-Based Astronomy

### Early Developments
- 1946: First astronomical observations from space using V-2 rockets
- 1962: Launch of Ariel 1, the first international satellite for astronomy
- 1968: Launch of OAO-2, the first successful space observatory

### Key Milestones
- 1990: Launch of Hubble Space Telescope
- 1999: Launch of Chandra X-ray Observatory
- 2003: Launch of Spitzer Space Telescope
- 2021: Launch of James Webb Space Telescope

## Limitations of Ground-Based Astronomy

### Atmospheric Interference
- Absorption of certain wavelengths (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays)
- Distortion of light (atmospheric turbulence)
- Scattering of light

### Light Pollution
- Artificial light from urban areas obscures faint objects
- Affects visibility of stars, nebulae, and galaxies

### Weather Constraints
- Cloud cover blocks observations
- Humidity affects image quality
- Wind can disrupt telescope operations

## Advantages of Space-Based Observations

### Unobstructed View
- No atmospheric distortion
- Clearer, sharper images

### Full Electromagnetic Spectrum
- Access to wavelengths blocked by Earth's atmosphere
- Observations in X-ray, gamma-ray, and far-infrared

### Continuous Observation
- No day/night cycle interruptions
- Ability to monitor events over extended periods

### Stable Environment
- No effects from weather or seismic activity
- Consistent temperature and pressure

## Overview of Major Space Telescopes

### Hubble Space Telescope
- Launch: 1990
- Wavelengths: Visible, ultraviolet, near-infrared
- Key discoveries: Dark energy, exoplanets, galaxy evolution

### Chandra X-ray Observatory
- Launch: 1999
- Wavelengths: X-ray
- Key discoveries: Black holes, dark matter distribution, supernova remnants

### James Webb Space Telescope
- Launch: 2021
- Wavelengths: Infrared
- Objectives: Early universe, exoplanet atmospheres, star formation

# Discussion Questions

1. How has space-based astronomy changed our understanding of the universe compared to ground-based observations?
2. What are the trade-offs between ground-based and space-based telescopes in terms of cost, maintenance, and scientific capabilities?
3. How might future advancements in space-based astronomy impact our search for extraterrestrial life?
4. In what ways could Timor Leste benefit from participating in international space science collaborations?
5. How do you think space-based astronomy will evolve in the next 50 years?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. Compare and contrast the capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope. How do their different designs and wavelength sensitivities complement each other?

2. Imagine you are designing a new space telescope. Describe its primary scientific objectives, the wavelengths it would observe, and any unique features that would set it apart from existing telescopes.

3. Discuss the potential impact of space-based astronomy on our understanding of dark matter and dark energy. How have space telescopes contributed to these fields, and what future discoveries might be possible?
