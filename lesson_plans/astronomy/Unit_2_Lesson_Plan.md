# Lesson Plan: The Electromagnetic Spectrum

## Resources Needed
- Computer with projector
- Prism and flashlight
- Colored paper (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet)
- Poster paper and markers
- Handouts with blank electromagnetic spectrum diagram

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Describe the basic properties of electromagnetic waves
2. Identify the major regions of the electromagnetic spectrum
3. Explain how atmospheric opacity affects observations of different wavelengths

## Warm-up Activity (5 minutes)
Ask students to brainstorm different types of "invisible light" they've heard of (e.g. ultraviolet, infrared, X-rays). Write responses on the board.

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)
Introduce and define key terms:
- Electromagnetic radiation
- Wavelength
- Frequency 
- Spectrum
- Atmospheric opacity

## Main Lesson Content (25 minutes)

### 1. Properties of Electromagnetic Waves (10 minutes)
- Explain that all electromagnetic radiation travels as waves
- Discuss relationship between wavelength and frequency
- Demonstrate wave properties using a rope or slinky

### 2. Regions of the Electromagnetic Spectrum (10 minutes)
- Present diagram of full electromagnetic spectrum
- Discuss major regions: radio, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray, gamma ray
- Highlight visible light as a tiny portion of the full spectrum

### 3. Atmospheric Opacity (5 minutes)
- Explain how Earth's atmosphere blocks certain wavelengths
- Discuss why space telescopes are needed to observe some parts of the spectrum

## Practice Activities (20 minutes)

### 1. Prism Demonstration (10 minutes)
Use a prism and flashlight to demonstrate splitting of visible light into component colors

### 2. Spectrum Labeling (10 minutes)
Students label blank electromagnetic spectrum diagrams with major regions and wavelengths

## Production Task (20 minutes)
In small groups, students create posters explaining one region of the electromagnetic spectrum, including:
- Wavelength range
- Common sources
- Uses in astronomy
- Any special properties

## Wrap-up and Review (5 minutes)
- Quick quiz: teacher states a type of electromagnetic radiation, students point to its location on a spectrum diagram
- Review key points about properties of EM waves and atmospheric effects

## Homework Assignment
Research and write a one-page report on how one type of space telescope (e.g. radio, X-ray, gamma-ray) observes the universe in wavelengths invisible from Earth's surface.

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Electromagnetic radiation: Energy that travels through space as waves of electric and magnetic fields
- Wavelength: The distance between successive crests of a wave
- Frequency: The number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given time
- Spectrum: The range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation
- Atmospheric opacity: The degree to which the atmosphere blocks or absorbs different wavelengths of radiation
