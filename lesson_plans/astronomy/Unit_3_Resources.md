## Types of Space Telescopes

### Optical Telescopes
- Collect and focus visible light
- Examples: Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope
- Key components:
  - Primary mirror: Collects and focuses light
  - Secondary mirror: Reflects light to instruments
  - Scientific instruments: Analyze collected light
- Advantages over ground-based:
  - No atmospheric distortion
  - Can observe ultraviolet light

### Radio Telescopes
- Detect radio waves from celestial objects
- Examples: Spektr-R, HALCA
- Key components:
  - Large dish antenna
  - Sensitive radio receivers
- Advantages of space-based:
  - No interference from Earth's ionosphere
  - Can create larger virtual telescopes through interferometry

### X-ray Telescopes
- Detect X-rays from high-energy phenomena
- Examples: Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton
- Key components:
  - Grazing incidence mirrors
  - X-ray detectors
- Necessary for space: X-rays don't penetrate Earth's atmosphere

## Detectors and Imaging Technologies

### CCDs (Charge-Coupled Devices)
- Convert light into electronic signals
- High sensitivity and efficiency
- Used in most modern space telescopes

### Spectrometers
- Separate light into component wavelengths
- Types: Grating spectrometers, prism spectrometers
- Provide information on chemical composition, temperature, motion

### Photometers
- Measure the intensity of light
- Can detect very faint objects
- Often used in conjunction with other instruments

## Challenges of Space-Based Astronomy

### Launching and Deployment
- High costs
- Limited payload size and weight
- Risk of launch failure

### Maintenance and Repairs
- Difficult or impossible to service
- Must be designed for long-term reliability

### Thermal Control
- Extreme temperature variations in space
- Requires sophisticated cooling systems (e.g., cryogenic cooling)

### Data Transmission
- Limited bandwidth for sending data to Earth
- Requires efficient data compression and transmission protocols
