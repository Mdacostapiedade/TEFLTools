# Lesson Plan: Solar System Exploration from Space

## Resources Needed
- Computer with internet access and projector
- Recent images from Mars rovers (e.g. Perseverance, Curiosity)
- Handouts with exoplanet detection methods
- Whiteboard and markers
- Student notebooks and writing materials

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Describe at least 3 major discoveries from planetary missions
2. Explain how space-based observations have enhanced our understanding of comets, asteroids, and small bodies
3. Compare and contrast at least 2 methods of exoplanet detection

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
1. Display an image of the solar system on the projector
2. Ask students to write down 3 things they know about exploring the solar system from space
3. Have students share their ideas with a partner
4. Briefly discuss as a class, noting key points on the whiteboard

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)
Write the following terms on the whiteboard and briefly explain each:
- Planetary mission
- Exoplanet
- Transit method
- Radial velocity method
- Small bodies (in the context of the solar system)

## Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Planetary Missions and Discoveries
1. Provide an overview of major planetary missions (e.g. Voyager, Cassini, New Horizons)
2. Highlight key discoveries from these missions:
   - Jupiter's active moons (Voyager)
   - Saturn's complex ring system (Cassini)
   - Pluto's geological activity (New Horizons)

### Comets, Asteroids, and Small Bodies
1. Explain how space-based observations have improved our understanding of these objects
2. Discuss missions like Rosetta (comet exploration) and OSIRIS-REx (asteroid sample return)
3. Highlight the importance of studying these objects for understanding solar system formation

### Exoplanet Detection
1. Introduce the concept of exoplanets
2. Explain the transit method of detection
3. Describe the radial velocity method
4. Discuss the advantages of space-based telescopes (e.g. Kepler, TESS) for exoplanet detection

## Practice Activities (20 minutes)
1. Divide students into small groups
2. Provide each group with recent images from Mars rovers
3. Ask groups to analyze the images and identify interesting features or potential signs of past water activity
4. Have groups share their findings with the class

## Production Task (15 minutes)
1. Students work individually to create a diagram illustrating either the transit method or radial velocity method of exoplanet detection
2. Encourage students to include labels and a brief explanation of how the method works

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
1. Conduct a quick quiz using the following questions:
   - Name one major discovery from a planetary mission
   - How have space-based observations improved our understanding of comets and asteroids?
   - What are two methods used to detect exoplanets?
2. Review the answers as a class

## Homework Assignment
1. Research one recent planetary mission or exoplanet discovery
2. Write a one-page summary including:
   - Mission/discovery name and date
   - Key findings or characteristics
   - Significance of the mission/discovery for our understanding of the solar system or exoplanets

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Planetary mission: A space exploration project designed to study one or more planets in our solar system
- Exoplanet: A planet orbiting a star other than our Sun
- Transit method: A technique for detecting exoplanets by observing the slight dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it
- Radial velocity method: A technique for detecting exoplanets by measuring the slight wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet
- Small bodies: Objects in the solar system that are neither planets nor dwarf planets, including asteroids, comets, and small moons
