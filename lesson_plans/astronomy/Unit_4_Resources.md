## Planetary Missions and Discoveries

### Overview of Major Planetary Missions
- Voyager 1 and 2 (1977-present): Grand Tour of outer planets
- Cassini-Huygens (1997-2017): Explored Saturn and its moons
- New Horizons (2006-present): Pluto flyby and Kuiper Belt exploration

### Key Discoveries
1. Voyager Missions
   - Jupiter's active volcanic moon Io
   - Complex magnetospheres of gas giants
   - Neptune's Great Dark Spot and high-speed winds

2. Cassini-Huygens Mission
   - Detailed mapping of Saturn's rings
   - Discovery of hydrocarbon lakes on Titan
   - Enceladus' subsurface ocean and geysers

3. New Horizons Mission
   - Pluto's geological diversity and activity
   - Heart-shaped nitrogen ice plain (Sputnik Planitia)
   - Possible subsurface ocean on Pluto

## Comets, Asteroids, and Small Bodies

### Space-Based Observations
- Improved resolution and continuous monitoring
- Ability to observe in multiple wavelengths
- No atmospheric interference

### Key Missions
1. Rosetta (2004-2016)
   - First spacecraft to orbit a comet (67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko)
   - Studied comet composition and activity

2. OSIRIS-REx (2016-present)
   - Asteroid Bennu sample return mission
   - Detailed mapping of asteroid surface

### Importance of Studying Small Bodies
- Provide insights into early solar system formation
- Potential source of Earth's water and organic compounds
- Assess impact risks and develop mitigation strategies

## Exoplanet Detection

### Transit Method
- Observes periodic dimming of star's light as planet passes in front
- Can determine planet size and orbital period
- Requires alignment of planet's orbit with our line of sight

### Radial Velocity Method
- Measures star's "wobble" due to planet's gravitational pull
- Can determine planet's mass and orbital period
- More effective for massive planets close to their stars

### Space-Based Telescopes for Exoplanet Detection
1. Kepler Space Telescope (2009-2018)
   - Discovered over 2,600 confirmed exoplanets
   - Revealed prevalence of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes

2. Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) (2018-present)
   - Surveying 200,000 brightest stars near Earth
   - Focusing on finding Earth-sized planets in habitable zones

# Discussion Questions

1. How have space-based observations changed our understanding of the solar system compared to ground-based observations?

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of different types of planetary missions (e.g., flybys, orbiters, landers)?

3. How might studying comets and asteroids help us understand the formation of Earth and the origins of life?

4. Compare and contrast the transit and radial velocity methods for exoplanet detection. What are the strengths and limitations of each?

5. How has the discovery of exoplanets changed our perspective on our place in the universe?

6. What ethical considerations should be taken into account when planning future planetary exploration missions?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. Imagine you are a scientist proposing a new planetary mission. Describe the target of your mission, its objectives, and the potential scientific impact.

2. Compare the challenges of exploring the outer solar system (e.g., Jupiter and beyond) with those of exploring the inner solar system.

3. Discuss the potential implications of discovering microbial life on another planet or moon in our solar system.

# Assignment Details

## Research Project: Recent Planetary Mission or Exoplanet Discovery

2. Write a one-page summary (approximately 250-300 words) including:
   - Mission/discovery name and date
   - Key findings or characteristics
   - Significance of the mission/discovery for our understanding of the solar system or exoplanets

3. Include at least two reliable sources, properly cited.

4. Optional: Include a relevant image or diagram with proper attribution.

5. Submit your summary as a PDF or Word document through the course management system.
