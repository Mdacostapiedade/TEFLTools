## Stellar Life Cycles

### Star Formation
- Stars form in giant molecular clouds composed of gas and dust
- Gravitational collapse of dense regions within the cloud
- As material collapses, it heats up and begins to rotate
- A protostar forms at the center
- Accretion disk surrounds the protostar
- When core temperature reaches ~15 million K, hydrogen fusion begins

### Main Sequence
- Stars spend most of their lives on the main sequence
- Hydrogen fusion in the core produces helium
- Hydrostatic equilibrium between gravity and outward pressure
- Main sequence lifetime depends on mass (more massive = shorter life)

### Red Giants and Supergiants
- When core hydrogen is depleted, star expands and cools
- Hydrogen fusion continues in a shell around the core
- Low/medium mass stars become red giants
- Massive stars become red supergiants
- Helium fusion begins in the core

### Stellar End States
- Low mass stars (< 8 solar masses):
  - Lose outer layers, forming planetary nebula
  - Core becomes a white dwarf
- Massive stars (> 8 solar masses):
  - Undergo supernova explosion
  - Core becomes neutron star or black hole

## Milky Way Structure

### Galactic Center
- Supermassive black hole (Sagittarius A*) at the core
- Mass of ~4 million solar masses
- Dense cluster of stars surrounds the black hole
- High levels of star formation activity

### Disk and Spiral Arms
- Thin disk ~1000 light-years thick, ~100,000 light-years in diameter
- Contains most of the galaxy's gas, dust, and young stars
- Spiral arms are regions of increased density
- Ongoing star formation in spiral arms

### Halo
- Roughly spherical region surrounding the disk
- Contains old stars and globular clusters
- Dark matter halo extends beyond visible galaxy

### Stellar Populations
- Population I: Young, metal-rich stars in the disk
- Population II: Old, metal-poor stars in the halo and bulge

# Discussion Questions

1. How does a star's mass affect its evolution and ultimate fate?
2. What evidence do we have for the existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy?
3. Compare and contrast the properties of stars found in the galactic disk versus the halo.
4. How do spiral arms contribute to ongoing star formation in the galaxy?
5. What role does dark matter play in the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way?
6. How might the evolution of our Sun differ from that of a more massive star?
7. Discuss the importance of stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes) in our understanding of stellar evolution.
8. How do globular clusters provide information about the age and formation history of our galaxy?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. The life cycle of a sun-like star, from birth to death
2. The structure and components of the Milky Way galaxy
3. The role of space-based telescopes in advancing our understanding of stellar astrophysics

Your essay should include:
- An introduction that clearly states the topic and main points
- Well-organized paragraphs with topic sentences
- Specific examples and evidence to support your points
- A conclusion that summarizes the main ideas and their significance

Use proper scientific terminology and cite at least two reliable sources.

# Assignment Details

## Hubble Image Analysis

1. Examine the provided Hubble Space Telescope images of star-forming regions
2. Identify and label the following features:
   - Newly formed stars
   - Gas and dust clouds
   - Shock waves or stellar winds
   - Any other notable structures
3. Write a short paragraph (3-5 sentences) describing what the image reveals about star formation processes

## Milky Way Galaxy Model

Create a scale model of the Milky Way galaxy using the provided materials:
- Use colored paper to represent different components (disk, bulge, halo)
- Cut out spiral arms and arrange them correctly
- Place markers to indicate the position of the Sun, galactic center, and notable features
- Include a legend explaining the scale and color coding used

Your model should accurately represent:
- The overall shape and structure of the galaxy
- The relative sizes and positions of major components
- The location of the galactic center and spiral arms

Be prepared to present your model to the class, explaining the key features and your design choices.
