# Resources for Learning Unit 1: Introduction to Bamboo in Timor-Leste

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Overview of bamboo use in Timor-Leste

#### Historical context
- Bamboo has been used in Timor-Leste for centuries
- Traditional uses include housing, fencing, water pipes, and household items
- Spiritual significance in some animist beliefs

#### Current applications
- Construction: temporary and permanent housing, scaffolding, bridges
- Agriculture: irrigation systems, crop support structures
- Crafts: baskets, mats, musical instruments
- Daily life: cooking utensils, furniture, food (bamboo shoots)

### Common bamboo species in Timor-Leste and their properties

1. Bambusa vulgaris (Common bamboo)
   - Characteristics: Large, thick-walled culms; green or yellow
   - Uses: Construction, furniture, crafts

2. Dendrocalamus asper (Giant bamboo)
   - Characteristics: Very large diameter, thick walls
   - Uses: Heavy construction, water pipes, furniture

3. Gigantochloa atter (Atter bamboo)
   - Characteristics: Medium-sized, straight culms
   - Uses: Construction, basketry, musical instruments

4. Schizostachyum lima (Lima bamboo)
   - Characteristics: Thin-walled, flexible culms
   - Uses: Weaving, basketry, light construction

5. Bambusa blumeana (Spiny bamboo)
   - Characteristics: Thorny branches, strong culms
   - Uses: Fencing, tool handles, construction

### Ecological and economic benefits of bamboo

#### Ecological benefits
1. Rapid growth and regeneration
   - Fastest growing plant on Earth
   - Can be harvested every 3-5 years without replanting

2. Soil stabilization and erosion control
   - Extensive root system holds soil in place
   - Effective in preventing landslides and riverbank erosion

3. Carbon sequestration
   - Absorbs more CO2 than equivalent stand of trees
   - Stores carbon in biomass and soil

4. Water conservation
   - Reduces runoff and increases water infiltration
   - Can help recharge groundwater

5. Biodiversity support
   - Provides habitat for various species
   - Can be integrated into agroforestry systems

#### Economic benefits
1. Versatility
   - Multiple uses in construction, crafts, and daily life
   - Potential for value-added products (e.g., bamboo textiles, activated charcoal)

2. Low cost and accessibility
   - Grows naturally in many areas of Timor-Leste
   - Requires minimal inputs for cultivation

3. Potential for sustainable industry
   - Opportunity for local job creation
   - Export potential for bamboo products

4. Disaster resilience
   - Can be used for quick reconstruction after natural disasters
   - Flexible and earthquake-resistant building material

5. Energy source
   - Can be used as a renewable biomass fuel
   - Potential for bamboo charcoal production

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How has bamboo traditionally been used in your family or community? Are these uses still common today?

2. What advantages does bamboo have over other construction materials like concrete or steel? What are its limitations?

3. How might increased use of bamboo in construction and industry affect Timor-Leste's economy and environment?

4. What challenges might arise in promoting bamboo as a sustainable resource in Timor-Leste?

5. How can traditional knowledge about bamboo be integrated with modern scientific understanding to improve its use?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. The role of bamboo in Timorese culture and its potential for future development
2. Comparing bamboo with other construction materials in the context of Timor-Leste
3. Developing a sustainable bamboo industry in Timor-Leste: opportunities and challenges

Your essay should include:
- An introduction stating your main argument
- At least three supporting points with examples
- A conclusion summarizing your key ideas
- References to at least two sources (can include lecture notes and field observations)

## 4. Assignment Details: Visual Guide of Timorese Bamboo Species

Create a visual guide featuring 5 bamboo species observed during the field trip. The guide should be presented in a creative format such as a poster, booklet, or digital presentation.

For each species, include:
1. A clear photograph or detailed drawing
2. Common name in Tetum and English (if applicable)
3. Scientific name
4. Key identifying characteristics:
   - Culm size (diameter and height)
   - Internode length
   - Color and texture of culm
   - Leaf shape and size
   - Any unique features (e.g., thorns, stripes)
5. Common uses in Timor-Leste
6. One interesting fact about the species

Evaluation criteria:
- Accuracy of information (40%)
- Visual presentation and creativity (30%)
- Completeness of required elements (20%)
- Proper labeling and organization (10%)

## 5. Additional Materials

### Case Study: Bamboo Housing Project in Atauro Island

In 2018, a pilot project was launched on Atauro Island to build bamboo houses resistant to earthquakes and strong winds. The project, led by local NGO Permatil in collaboration with international partners, aimed to demonstrate the potential of bamboo as a sustainable and resilient building material.

Key points:
- Houses were designed using local bamboo species and traditional building techniques
- Community members were trained in bamboo treatment and construction methods
- The project created local employment and skills development opportunities
- Initial results showed improved living conditions and disaster resilience for participating families

Discussion prompt: How could this project be scaled up or adapted for other regions of Timor-Leste?

### Sample Bamboo Identification Key

Use this simplified key to help identify common bamboo species in Timor-Leste:

1. a. Culm diameter > 10 cm → go to 2
   b. Culm diameter < 10 cm → go to 3

2. a. Culms with thorny branches → Bambusa blumeana
   b. Culms without thorns → Dendrocalamus asper

3. a. Culms with prominent white rings at nodes → Bambusa vulgaris
   b. Culms without prominent white rings → go to 4

4. a. Culm walls very thin and flexible → Schizostachyum lima
   b. Culm walls thicker, less flexible → Gigantochloa atter

Note: This is a simplified key for educational purposes. Accurate identification may require additional characteristics and expert verification.
