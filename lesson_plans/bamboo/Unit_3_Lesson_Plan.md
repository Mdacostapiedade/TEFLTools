Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 3: Bamboo Treatment and Preservation, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Bamboo Treatment and Preservation

## 1. Resources Needed

- Bamboo poles (various species common in Timor-Leste)
- Borax and boric acid
- Large containers for soaking bamboo
- Protective gear (gloves, goggles, masks)
- Traditional Timorese treatment materials (e.g., lime, smoke chamber)
- Drying racks or space
- Moisture meter
- Handouts on treatment methods and safety procedures

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the importance of bamboo treatment for durability
- Describe at least two traditional Timorese bamboo treatment methods
- Demonstrate the borax-boric acid treatment process
- Compare the effectiveness of different preservation techniques
- Properly dry and store treated bamboo

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show students two pieces of bamboo: one untreated and deteriorated, one treated and well-preserved
- Ask students to discuss in pairs what they think caused the difference and why treatment might be important

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Preservation
- Borax-boric acid treatment
- Leaching
- Moisture content
- Fungal decay
- Insect infestation

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

1. Importance of bamboo treatment
   - Discuss natural vulnerabilities of bamboo
   - Explain how treatment extends bamboo lifespan

2. Traditional Timorese treatment methods
   - Describe smoke treatment
   - Explain lime soaking process

3. Modern preservation techniques
   - Detail the borax-boric acid treatment method
   - Discuss other chemical treatments briefly

4. Proper drying and storage
   - Explain ideal moisture content for construction
   - Describe best practices for storing treated bamboo

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

1. Divide class into groups
2. Each group practices:
   - Preparing borax-boric acid solution
   - Soaking bamboo pieces in the solution
   - Setting up bamboo for traditional smoke treatment

## 7. Production Tasks (90 minutes)

1. Groups treat several bamboo poles using different methods:
   - Borax-boric acid treatment
   - Traditional smoke treatment
   - Lime soaking
   - Control group (no treatment)

2. Students label and prepare treated bamboo for drying

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (20 minutes)

- Class discussion on observations from treatment processes
- Quick quiz on key points of the lesson
- Address any questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 1-page report on an additional bamboo treatment method not covered in class
- Begin a treatment log to track the progress of bamboo treated in class over the next few weeks

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Preservation: The process of treating bamboo to protect it from decay and extend its lifespan
- Borax-boric acid treatment: A chemical preservation method using a mixture of borax and boric acid to protect bamboo from insects and fungi
- Leaching: The process by which soluble substances are washed out of bamboo by water
- Moisture content: The amount of water present in bamboo, usually expressed as a percentage
- Fungal decay: Deterioration of bamboo caused by fungi, often resulting from high moisture content
- Insect infestation: The presence of insects, such as beetles or termites, that can damage bamboo
