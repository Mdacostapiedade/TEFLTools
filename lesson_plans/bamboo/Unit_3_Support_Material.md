# Support Material for Bamboo Treatment and Preservation Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Preservation**: The process of treating bamboo to protect it from decay and extend its lifespan
- **Borax-boric acid treatment**: A chemical preservation method using a mixture of borax and boric acid to protect bamboo from insects and fungi
- **Leaching**: The process by which soluble substances are washed out of bamboo by water
- **Moisture content**: The amount of water present in bamboo, usually expressed as a percentage
- **Fungal decay**: Deterioration of bamboo caused by fungi, often resulting from high moisture content
- **Insect infestation**: The presence of insects, such as beetles or termites, that can damage bamboo
- **Smoke treatment**: A traditional method of preserving bamboo by exposing it to smoke
- **Lime soaking**: A traditional preservation technique involving soaking bamboo in a lime solution

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited access to chemical treatment materials
   - Solution: Focus more on traditional methods and explore locally available natural preservatives

2. Challenge: Students struggling with precise measurements for chemical solutions
   - Solution: Provide pre-measured kits and emphasize the importance of accuracy through practical demonstrations

3. Challenge: Ensuring long-term observation of treated bamboo
   - Solution: Establish a class "bamboo treatment garden" where samples can be monitored over an extended period

4. Challenge: Addressing misconceptions about the effectiveness of traditional methods
   - Solution: Invite local experts to share their experiences and showcase well-preserved traditional structures

5. Challenge: Managing time for hands-on activities
   - Solution: Prepare materials in advance and consider splitting the practical session over multiple classes

6. Challenge: Ensuring proper safety precautions during chemical treatments
   - Solution: Conduct a dedicated safety briefing and demonstration before hands-on activities, and provide a detailed safety handout
