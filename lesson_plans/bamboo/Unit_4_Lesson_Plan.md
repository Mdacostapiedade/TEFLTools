# Lesson Plan: Basic Bamboo Joinery Techniques

## 1. Resources Needed

- Various bamboo poles (different diameters and lengths)
- Hand saws, chisels, hammers, and measuring tools
- Natural binding materials (rattan, bamboo strips)
- Synthetic binding materials (rope, wire)
- Safety equipment (gloves, goggles, dust masks)
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts with diagrams of different bamboo joints
- "Designing and Building with Bamboo" by Jules J.A. Janssen (reference book)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify and describe at least five different bamboo joinery techniques
- Understand the structural principles behind bamboo connections
- Safely use tools to create basic bamboo joints
- Select appropriate joinery methods for different structural needs

## 3. Warm-up Activity (15 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a set of bamboo poles and natural binding materials
- Challenge: Create the strongest possible connection between two bamboo poles in 10 minutes
- Discuss and compare the different approaches taken by each group

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (20 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  - Lashing
  - Mortise and tenon
  - Dowel joint
  - Fish-mouth joint
  - Compression and tension forces
- Show visual examples of each joint type and discuss their applications

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

- Traditional Timorese bamboo joinery techniques
  - Demonstrate lashing techniques using natural materials
  - Explain cultural significance and historical use
- Modern bamboo connection methods
  - Showcase contemporary joinery techniques (e.g., bolted connections, steel inserts)
  - Discuss advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional methods
- Structural principles of bamboo connections
  - Explain load distribution in different joint types
  - Demonstrate how to choose appropriate joints for various structural needs

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

- Divide class into pairs
- Assign each pair a specific joint type to practice
- Provide step-by-step guidance for creating:
  - Simple lashed joint
  - Fish-mouth joint
  - Dowel joint
  - Mortise and tenon joint
- Circulate to provide assistance and feedback

## 7. Production Tasks (90 minutes)

- Challenge: Design and build a small bamboo structure (e.g., a stool or small table)
- Requirements:
  - Use at least three different joinery techniques
  - Structure must be stable and able to support weight
  - Incorporate both traditional and modern joinery methods
- Students work in groups of 3-4
- Present completed structures to the class, explaining joinery choices

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (20 minutes)

- Class discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of different joinery techniques
- Review key structural principles and their application in the built structures
- Address any remaining questions or challenges encountered during the production task

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and document three traditional Timorese structures that use bamboo joinery
- For each structure, identify:
  - Types of joints used
  - Reasons for choosing those specific joints
  - How the joinery contributes to the overall structural integrity
- Prepare a short presentation (5 minutes) to share findings in the next class

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Lashing: A method of joining bamboo poles using rope or flexible materials wrapped around the intersection
- Mortise and tenon: A joint where a projecting part (tenon) fits into a corresponding cavity (mortise)
- Dowel joint: A connection using a cylindrical peg to join two pieces of bamboo
- Fish-mouth joint: A curved cut at the end of a bamboo pole that fits around another pole
- Compression: The force that pushes bamboo poles together
- Tension: The force that pulls bamboo poles apart
