# Support Material: Basic Bamboo Joinery Techniques

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Lashing**: A method of joining bamboo poles using rope or flexible materials wrapped around the intersection
- **Mortise and tenon**: A joint where a projecting part (tenon) fits into a corresponding cavity (mortise)
- **Dowel joint**: A connection using a cylindrical peg to join two pieces of bamboo
- **Fish-mouth joint**: A curved cut at the end of a bamboo pole that fits around another pole
- **Compression**: The force that pushes bamboo poles together
- **Tension**: The force that pulls bamboo poles apart
- **Structural integrity**: The ability of a structure to withstand loads without breaking or deforming excessively
- **Load distribution**: How weight or force is spread across a structure
- **Natural binding materials**: Materials like rattan or bamboo strips used for lashing
- **Synthetic binding materials**: Man-made materials like rope or wire used for joining bamboo

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Bamboo Joint Types Diagram:
   - A series of simple line drawings showing:
     a) Lashed joint
     b) Mortise and tenon joint
     c) Dowel joint
     d) Fish-mouth joint
   - Each drawing labeled with the joint name and key components

2. Load Distribution Illustration:
   - Two side-by-side diagrams of a simple bamboo structure (e.g., a frame)
   - One diagram showing compression forces with arrows pointing inward
   - One diagram showing tension forces with arrows pointing outward
   - Labeled to indicate where each type of force is typically found in the structure

3. Traditional vs. Modern Joinery Comparison:
   - A split image showing:
     a) Traditional lashed joint using natural materials
     b) Modern bolted connection with steel inserts
   - Labeled to highlight key differences and similarities

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Bamboo Joint Identification Worksheet:
   - Images of various bamboo joints
   - Students label each joint type and list one advantage and one disadvantage of each

2. Joint Selection Guide:
   - Table with columns for:
     a) Joint type
     b) Best uses
     c) Tools required
     d) Difficulty level
   - Students fill in the table based on lesson content and their own experiences

3. Structural Analysis Worksheet:
   - Diagram of a simple bamboo structure (e.g., a small bridge or platform)
   - Students identify and label areas of compression and tension
   - Questions about which joints would be most appropriate for different parts of the structure

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Bamboo Connections and Joinery Techniques" by INBAR (International Network for Bamboo and Rattan)
2. "Traditional Bamboo Architecture in Timor-Leste" - A local case study (hypothetical resource)
3. Online video tutorial series: "Mastering Bamboo Joinery" by Build Up Nepal
4. "Structural Bamboo Design" by Trujillo, Ramage, and Chang (academic paper)
5. Local bamboo craftsperson workshops or demonstrations (to be arranged by the instructor)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Safety Concerns:
   - Challenge: Students may be unfamiliar with tools and safety procedures.
   - Solution: Begin with a thorough safety briefing. Demonstrate proper tool use and provide close supervision during practical activities.

2. Material Variability:
   - Challenge: Bamboo poles may vary in size and quality, affecting joinery.
   - Solution: Teach students how to select and prepare bamboo for consistent results. Emphasize the importance of adaptability in bamboo construction.

3. Time Management:
   - Challenge: Practical activities may take longer than expected.
   - Solution: Have pre-cut bamboo pieces available for some exercises. Consider extending the lesson over multiple sessions if needed.

4. Cultural Sensitivity:
   - Challenge: Balancing traditional methods with modern techniques.
   - Solution: Invite local experts to share traditional knowledge. Encourage discussion on how to respectfully integrate traditional and modern approaches.

5. Skill Level Differences:
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of prior experience with tools and construction.
   - Solution: Pair more experienced students with beginners. Provide additional support and simpler tasks for those who need it.

6. Language Barriers:
   - Challenge: Technical terms may be difficult for some students to understand.
   - Solution: Use visual aids extensively. Provide a glossary in both English and Tetum (or other local languages). Encourage students to create their own illustrated vocabulary guides.
