## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may lack prior knowledge of traditional architecture.
   **Solution**: Begin with a comprehensive overview and use plenty of visual aids. Consider inviting a local expert to give a guest lecture.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to traditional bamboo structures for field trips.
   **Solution**: Prepare a virtual tour using high-quality photos and videos if physical visits are not possible. Alternatively, arrange for a local craftsperson to demonstrate techniques in the classroom.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to see the relevance of traditional techniques in modern construction.
   **Solution**: Showcase successful modern projects that incorporate traditional elements. Discuss the sustainability and cultural preservation aspects of using traditional methods.

4. **Challenge**: Language barriers when interviewing community members during field trips.
   **Solution**: Prepare translated question sheets in advance. Consider partnering with a local translator or asking bilingual students to assist.

5. **Challenge**: Ensuring student safety during hands-on activities with bamboo.
   **Solution**: Provide thorough safety briefings, ensure proper protective equipment is used, and closely supervise all practical activities. Have a first aid kit readily available.
