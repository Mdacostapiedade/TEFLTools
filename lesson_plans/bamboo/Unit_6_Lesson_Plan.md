Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 6: Designing with Bamboo, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Designing with Bamboo

## 1. Resources Needed

- Textbook: "Designing and Building with Bamboo" by Jules J.A. Janssen
- Computer lab with CAD software (e.g., SketchUp, AutoCAD)
- Bamboo samples of various sizes and species
- Projector and screen
- Whiteboard and markers
- Graph paper and drawing tools

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the structural properties of bamboo relevant to building design
- Identify key considerations for designing bamboo structures
- Use basic CAD software to create simple bamboo structure designs
- Develop a conceptual design for a small bamboo structure suitable for a Timorese community

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show images of various bamboo structures from around the world
- Ask students to identify common design elements and discuss what they find appealing or interesting about each structure

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Tensile strength
- Compressive strength
- Flexural rigidity
- Load-bearing capacity
- Structural integrity
- Bamboo culm

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### A. Structural Properties of Bamboo
- Discuss the unique properties of bamboo as a building material
- Compare bamboo's strength-to-weight ratio with other materials

### B. Design Considerations for Bamboo Buildings
- Explain the importance of proper joint design
- Discuss strategies for protecting bamboo from moisture and insects
- Present guidelines for bamboo column and beam sizing

### C. Introduction to Computer-Aided Design for Bamboo Structures
- Demonstrate basic CAD tools for creating bamboo structural elements
- Show examples of bamboo structures designed using CAD software

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- In small groups, have students analyze the structural elements of a given bamboo building design
- Guide students through a simple bamboo joint design exercise using CAD software

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Students begin working on their individual designs for a small bamboo structure suitable for a Timorese community
- Encourage students to consider local climate, cultural context, and available resources in their designs

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap the key points of the lesson
- Address any questions or concerns from students
- Preview the upcoming class workshop where students will present their designs

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Complete the initial design for the small bamboo structure
- Prepare a brief presentation (5 minutes) explaining the design concept, structural elements, and how it addresses the needs of a Timorese community
- Read Chapter 5 of "Designing and Building with Bamboo" by Jules J.A. Janssen

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Tensile strength: The maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched before breaking
- Compressive strength: The capacity of a material to withstand loads tending to reduce size
- Flexural rigidity: The resistance of a structural element to bending
- Load-bearing capacity: The maximum load that a structural element can support without failure
- Structural integrity: The ability of a structure to withstand its intended loads without breaking or deforming excessively
- Bamboo culm: The hollow stem of the bamboo plant used in construction
