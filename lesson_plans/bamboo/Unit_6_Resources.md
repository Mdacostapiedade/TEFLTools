# Resources for Learning Unit 6: Designing with Bamboo

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Structural Properties of Bamboo

#### Introduction
- Bamboo is a natural composite material with unique structural properties
- Its hollow, tubular structure provides excellent strength-to-weight ratio

#### Key Properties
1. Tensile Strength
   - Bamboo fibers have high tensile strength, comparable to steel in some species
   - Varies depending on species, age, and culm section
   - Average tensile strength: 350-500 N/mm²

2. Compressive Strength
   - Bamboo performs well under compression, especially parallel to fibers
   - Compressive strength increases with age and decreases with height
   - Average compressive strength: 40-80 N/mm²

3. Flexural Rigidity
   - Bamboo's hollow structure provides good flexural properties
   - Modulus of elasticity: 10,000-20,000 N/mm²
   - Allows for flexible yet strong construction

4. Load-bearing Capacity
   - Depends on culm diameter, wall thickness, and internode length
   - Proper joint design crucial for maximizing load-bearing capacity

5. Durability
   - Natural durability varies by species and treatment
   - Proper treatment can significantly extend lifespan (20-30 years or more)

### Design Considerations for Bamboo Buildings

#### Site and Climate Factors
1. Local climate considerations
   - Temperature and humidity fluctuations
   - Rainfall patterns and potential flooding
   - Sun exposure and shading needs

2. Soil conditions and foundation requirements
   - Soil type and stability
   - Drainage considerations

#### Structural Design Principles
1. Bamboo column and beam sizing
   - Rule of thumb: Length-to-diameter ratio should not exceed 30:1 for columns
   - Beam span limitations based on culm diameter and loading

2. Joint design
   - Critical for overall structural integrity
   - Types: lashed, pinned, bolted, and modern engineered connections
   - Importance of allowing for movement and preventing splitting

3. Roof design
   - Light-weight roofing materials preferred (e.g., thatch, corrugated metal)
   - Proper overhang for weather protection
   - Ventilation considerations

4. Wall systems
   - Bamboo frame with infill options (e.g., bamboo mats, earth, or other local materials)
   - Consideration of lateral stability and bracing

#### Material Protection and Maintenance
1. Moisture protection
   - Proper detailing to prevent water ingress
   - Use of water-resistant coatings or treatments

2. Insect and fungal protection
   - Chemical treatments (e.g., borax-boric acid)
   - Traditional methods (e.g., smoking, lime washing)

3. Fire resistance considerations
   - Use of fire-retardant treatments
   - Proper spacing and compartmentalization in design

### Computer-Aided Design for Bamboo Structures

#### Introduction to CAD for Bamboo
1. Benefits of using CAD for bamboo design
   - Precise modeling of complex geometries
   - Easy modification and iteration of designs
   - Generation of accurate material lists and construction documents

2. Common software options
   - SketchUp: User-friendly, good for conceptual design
   - AutoCAD: Industry standard, powerful 2D and 3D capabilities
   - Rhino: Excellent for complex curved structures

#### Basic CAD Techniques for Bamboo Structures
1. Modeling bamboo culms
   - Using cylinders or pipes to represent bamboo
   - Adjusting diameters and wall thicknesses

2. Creating joints and connections
   - Modeling lashed connections with lines or cylinders
   - Representing bolted connections with simple geometry

3. Designing bamboo trusses and frames
   - Using line work to create structural frameworks
   - Applying bamboo profiles to lines

4. Generating construction documents
   - Creating 2D plans, elevations, and sections from 3D models
   - Dimensioning and annotating drawings

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How do the structural properties of bamboo compare to other common building materials like wood or steel? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using bamboo in construction?

2. Discuss the importance of proper joint design in bamboo structures. What are some traditional joinery techniques used in Timor-Leste, and how might these be improved or adapted for modern construction?

3. How can we address the challenges of moisture and insect damage in bamboo buildings, particularly in the climate of Timor-Leste? What are some innovative solutions you've encountered or can propose?

4. In what ways can computer-aided design (CAD) improve the process of designing bamboo structures? What are some potential limitations or challenges of using CAD for bamboo design?

5. How might traditional Timorese bamboo building techniques be integrated with modern design principles to create culturally appropriate and structurally sound buildings?

6. Discuss the potential environmental impact of increased bamboo construction in Timor-Leste. What are the positive and negative aspects, and how can we ensure sustainable practices?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Designing a Bamboo Community Center for a Rural Timorese Village"

In your essay, address the following points:
- The specific needs and cultural considerations of the community
- Key structural design elements and how they utilize bamboo's properties
- Strategies for ensuring the building's durability and longevity
- How the design incorporates traditional Timorese building techniques
- Any innovative features or modern adaptations in the design

Your essay should demonstrate a clear understanding of bamboo's structural properties, design considerations for bamboo buildings, and sensitivity to the local context of Timor-Leste.
