Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Designing with Bamboo, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Designing with Bamboo Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Tensile strength: The maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched before breaking
- Compressive strength: The capacity of a material to withstand loads tending to reduce size
- Flexural rigidity: The resistance of a structural element to bending
- Load-bearing capacity: The maximum load that a structural element can support without failure
- Structural integrity: The ability of a structure to withstand its intended loads without breaking or deforming excessively
- Bamboo culm: The hollow stem of the bamboo plant used in construction
- Node: The solid part of the bamboo stem where branches emerge
- Internode: The hollow section between nodes in a bamboo culm
- Laminated bamboo: Bamboo strips glued together to form larger structural elements
- Bamboo composite: A material made by combining bamboo fibers with other materials like resins

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Bamboo Structural Properties Diagram:
   - Description: A visual representation comparing the strength-to-weight ratio of bamboo with other common building materials (e.g., wood, steel, concrete). Use bar graphs to show the relative values for tensile strength, compressive strength, and weight.

2. Bamboo Joint Types Illustration:
   - Description: A series of sketches showing common bamboo joinery techniques, including lashed joints, pinned joints, and mortise and tenon joints. Label each joint type and provide a brief description of its use and advantages.

3. Bamboo Building Elements Poster:
   - Description: A poster illustrating the main structural elements of a bamboo building, including columns, beams, trusses, and connections. Use color-coding to differentiate between load-bearing and non-load-bearing elements.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Bamboo Structure Analysis Worksheet:
   - Content: Provide students with images or diagrams of various bamboo structures. Ask them to identify and label key structural elements, explain the function of each element, and describe how forces are distributed throughout the structure.

2. Bamboo Joint Design Exercise:
   - Content: Present students with a specific structural challenge (e.g., connecting two bamboo culms at a 45-degree angle). Ask them to sketch and describe a joint design that would effectively solve the problem, considering factors such as load transfer and ease of construction.

3. Bamboo Building Design Checklist:
   - Content: Create a comprehensive checklist for students to use when developing their bamboo structure designs. Include sections on site analysis, material selection, structural considerations, cultural context, and sustainability factors.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with CAD software
   - Tip: Provide step-by-step tutorials and consider pairing more experienced students with those who need extra help.

2. Challenge: Limited access to bamboo samples
   - Tip: Create a bamboo sample library for the class, or use virtual 3D models and high-quality images as alternatives.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in visualizing 3D structures from 2D drawings
   - Tip: Use physical models, 3D printing, or augmented reality apps to help students better understand spatial relationships.

4. Challenge: Integrating traditional Timorese design elements
   - Tip: Invite local artisans or elders to share their knowledge and provide guidance on incorporating cultural elements.

5. Challenge: Ensuring designs are practical for local conditions
   - Tip: Encourage students to research local climate data, building codes, and available resources. Consider organizing field trips to observe existing bamboo structures in Timorese communities.
