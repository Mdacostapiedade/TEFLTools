Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 7: Building with Bamboo, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Building with Bamboo

## 1. Resources Needed

- Bamboo poles (various sizes)
- Basic carpentry tools (saws, chisels, hammers, drills)
- Bamboo joinery materials (lashing rope, wooden pegs)
- Safety equipment (gloves, goggles, dust masks)
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts with step-by-step construction guide
- Cameras or smartphones for documentation

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand the process of site preparation for bamboo construction
- Demonstrate proper techniques for bamboo frame construction
- Apply roofing and finishing techniques to a bamboo structure
- Document the construction process for future reference

## 3. Warm-up Activity (15 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Each group receives a set of bamboo poles and lashing materials
- Challenge: Create the tallest free-standing structure possible in 10 minutes
- Discuss the challenges faced and strategies used

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Foundation
- Load-bearing
- Truss
- Lashing
- Weatherproofing

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Site Preparation and Foundation Work
- Importance of proper site selection
- Soil testing and leveling techniques
- Types of foundations suitable for bamboo structures

### Bamboo Frame Construction
- Basic structural principles of bamboo buildings
- Techniques for creating strong and stable frames
- Demonstration of key joinery methods

### Roofing and Finishing Techniques
- Overview of roofing options compatible with bamboo structures
- Weatherproofing techniques for bamboo
- Finishing touches: windows, doors, and interior elements

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

- Divide class into teams of 4-5 students
- Each team practices:
  1. Creating a foundation layout
  2. Assembling a small bamboo frame
  3. Applying a simple roofing technique

## 7. Production Task (120 minutes)

- Teams collaborate to construct a small bamboo structure (e.g., garden shelter)
- Each team member rotates through different roles:
  1. Frame construction
  2. Joinery and lashing
  3. Roofing
  4. Documentation (photos and notes)

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (20 minutes)

- Each team presents their structure, explaining their process and challenges
- Class discussion on what worked well and areas for improvement
- Instructor summarizes key learning points and addresses any questions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Create a detailed construction guide for the structure built in class, including:
  1. Materials list
  2. Step-by-step instructions
  3. Diagrams or sketches
  4. Safety considerations
  5. Maintenance tips

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Foundation: The base upon which a structure is built, distributing its weight to the ground
- Load-bearing: Capable of supporting the weight of the structure above it
- Truss: A framework of beams forming a rigid structure, often used in roofing
- Lashing: A technique of securing bamboo poles together using rope or other flexible materials
- Weatherproofing: The process of protecting a structure from the effects of weather, such as rain and wind
