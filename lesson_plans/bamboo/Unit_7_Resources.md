# Resources for Learning Unit 7: Building with Bamboo

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Site Preparation and Foundation Work

#### Importance of Proper Site Selection
- Consider drainage, soil stability, and natural hazards
- Assess sun exposure and prevailing winds
- Evaluate accessibility for construction and future use

#### Soil Testing and Leveling Techniques
- Simple soil tests: jar test, ribbon test, and penetration test
- Use of string lines and spirit levels for accurate leveling
- Importance of compaction in soil preparation

#### Types of Foundations Suitable for Bamboo Structures
- Concrete pad foundations
- Stone or brick piers
- Bamboo post-in-ground technique with gravel beds
- Raised platform foundations for flood-prone areas

### Bamboo Frame Construction

#### Basic Structural Principles of Bamboo Buildings
- Triangulation for stability
- Even load distribution
- Importance of symmetry in design

#### Techniques for Creating Strong and Stable Frames
- Proper selection of bamboo poles (size, age, species)
- Vertical post placement and bracing
- Horizontal tie beams and their connections

#### Key Joinery Methods
- Fish-mouth joints for perpendicular connections
- Lashed joints using natural or synthetic cordage
- Dowel and peg reinforcement techniques
- Modern methods: bolted connections and steel plates

### Roofing and Finishing Techniques

#### Roofing Options Compatible with Bamboo Structures
- Traditional palm leaf or grass thatch
- Bamboo shingles or tiles
- Corrugated metal sheets
- Living roofs with suitable plants

#### Weatherproofing Techniques for Bamboo
- Natural sealants: linseed oil, tung oil
- Modern sealants: polyurethane, epoxy resins
- Importance of proper roof overhang
- Raised floors to prevent moisture damage

#### Finishing Touches
- Window and door frame installation
- Bamboo lattice work for walls
- Interior partitions and flooring options
- Integration of local decorative elements

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How does the choice of foundation affect the longevity and stability of a bamboo structure?
2. Compare and contrast traditional Timorese bamboo joinery techniques with modern methods. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
3. In what ways can bamboo construction techniques be adapted to address specific environmental challenges in Timor-Leste (e.g., earthquakes, floods)?
4. How might the incorporation of bamboo architecture influence the cultural identity and built environment of Timorese communities?
5. Discuss the potential economic impacts of promoting bamboo construction in Timor-Leste. Consider both local and export markets.

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. The role of bamboo architecture in preserving traditional building techniques while meeting modern needs in Timor-Leste.
2. A comparative analysis of bamboo and conventional building materials in terms of sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and cultural significance in the Timorese context.
3. Propose an innovative bamboo structure design that addresses a specific community need in Timor-Leste, explaining your design choices and construction methods.

### Case Study: Bamboo Community Center in Baucau, Timor-Leste

(Note: This is a fictional case study for educational purposes)

The Baucau Bamboo Community Center is a prime example of modern bamboo architecture in Timor-Leste. Built in 2019, this 200 square meter structure serves as a multi-purpose space for local gatherings, workshops, and as a temporary shelter during natural disasters.

Key features:
- Elevated design to prevent flood damage
- Innovative truss system allowing for a large, open interior space
- Integration of traditional Timorese decorative elements
- Rainwater harvesting system incorporated into the roof design
- Use of locally-sourced bamboo and other materials

The center was constructed over a period of three months, involving community members in the building process. This participatory approach not only reduced costs but also ensured the transfer of bamboo construction skills to the local population.

Challenges faced during construction included:
1. Adapting traditional joinery techniques for larger-scale construction
2. Ensuring proper treatment of bamboo for long-term durability
3. Meeting modern building code requirements while using traditional materials

The success of this project has inspired similar initiatives in other parts of Timor-Leste, contributing to a renewed interest in bamboo as a sustainable and culturally significant building material.

### Example: Bamboo Joint Strength Test Results

| Joint Type | Average Load Capacity (kg) | Failure Mode |
|------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| Lashed     | 250                        | Rope failure |
| Fish-mouth | 300                        | Bamboo split |
| Bolted     | 400                        | Bolt shear   |
| Doweled    | 350                        | Dowel shear  |

This table demonstrates the relative strengths of different bamboo joinery methods, based on tests conducted with local Timorese bamboo species. Use this information to inform your joint selection in your construction projects.
