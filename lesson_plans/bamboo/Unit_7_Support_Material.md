## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Safety Concerns:
   - Challenge: Ensuring student safety when using tools and working with bamboo.
   - Solution: Conduct a thorough safety briefing, demonstrate proper tool use, and provide close supervision during practical activities.

2. Material Variability:
   - Challenge: Bamboo poles may vary in size and quality.
   - Solution: Teach students how to select and grade bamboo, and emphasize the importance of flexibility in design and construction.

3. Time Management:
   - Challenge: Construction activities may take longer than expected.
   - Solution: Break down tasks into smaller, manageable steps and have contingency plans for extending activities if needed.

4. Cultural Sensitivity:
   - Challenge: Balancing modern techniques with traditional Timorese methods.
   - Solution: Invite local experts to share traditional knowledge and encourage students to incorporate both modern and traditional elements in their designs.

5. Limited Resources:
   - Challenge: Access to specialized bamboo tools or materials may be limited.
   - Solution: Demonstrate alternative techniques using locally available tools and materials, and encourage creative problem-solving.

6. Language Barriers:
   - Challenge: Technical terms may be difficult for some students to understand.
   - Solution: Provide a comprehensive vocabulary list with local language translations and use visual aids to reinforce concepts.

7. Varying Skill Levels:
   - Challenge: Students may have different levels of prior experience with construction.
   - Solution: Implement a buddy system pairing more experienced students with beginners, and provide additional support to those who need it.
