# Resources for Learning Unit 1: Introduction to Beekeeping in Timor-Leste

## 1. Lecture Notes

### History of Beekeeping in Timor-Leste

- Traditional honey hunting:
  - Ancient practice dating back centuries
  - Honey hunters would climb tall trees or cliffs to reach wild bee nests
  - Use of smoke to calm bees, often from burning specific plants
  - Harvesting entire combs, often destroying the colony

- Introduction of modern beekeeping:
  - Arrived with Portuguese colonization in the early 20th century
  - Introduction of European honeybee (Apis mellifera) attempted but unsuccessful
  - Focus shifted to management of native Apis cerana in box hives

- Current state of beekeeping:
  - Mix of traditional honey hunting and modern beekeeping practices
  - Growing interest in sustainable beekeeping for rural development
  - Challenges include deforestation, climate change, and lack of technical knowledge

### Native Bee Species of Timor-Leste

1. Apis cerana (Asian honey bee)
   - Characteristics:
     * Smaller than European honey bee
     * Yellow-brown coloration with darker stripes
     * Highly adaptable to various climates
   - Behavior:
     * Known for its docile nature
     * Excellent foragers, flying up to 1-2 km from the hive
     * Prone to absconding when disturbed or during food shortages
   - Habitat:
     * Natural nests in tree hollows, rock crevices
     * Adaptable to various hive designs

2. Trigona spp. (Stingless bees)
   - Diversity:
     * Multiple species present in Timor-Leste (exact number unknown)
     * Vary in size from 2-14mm
   - Nesting habits:
     * Build nests in tree hollows, rock crevices, or underground
     * Use a mixture of wax and plant resins (propolis) for construction
   - Honey production:
     * Produce less honey than Apis species
     * Honey has distinct flavor and medicinal properties
     * Traditional importance in Timorese culture

### Importance of Pollinators in Timor-Leste

- Role in crop pollination:
  * Essential for coffee production (a major export crop)
  * Important for fruit trees (e.g., mango, papaya, citrus)
  * Enhance yields in vegetable crops (e.g., cucumber, pumpkin)

- Impact on biodiversity:
  * Pollinate native plant species, maintaining forest ecosystems
  * Support wildlife by maintaining plant food sources

- Economic value:
  * Estimated value of pollination services in Timor-Leste (if available)
  * Potential for increasing agricultural productivity through improved pollination

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How has the practice of beekeeping in Timor-Leste changed over time? What factors might have influenced these changes?

2. Compare and contrast the characteristics of Apis cerana and Trigona spp. How might these differences affect beekeeping practices?

3. Why is it important to focus on native bee species for beekeeping in Timor-Leste rather than introducing non-native species?

4. How do you think climate change might affect bee populations and beekeeping in Timor-Leste? What adaptations might be necessary?

5. Discuss the potential economic and ecological benefits of promoting beekeeping in rural Timorese communities.

6. How might traditional knowledge about bees and honey hunting be integrated with modern sustainable beekeeping practices?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Topic: "The Importance of Bees in My Community"

Instructions:
1. Reflect on the role of bees in your local area. Consider both wild and managed bees.
2. Write a 500-word essay addressing the following points:
   - Describe any bee species you have observed in your community.
   - Explain how bees contribute to local agriculture or wild plant populations.
   - Discuss any traditional uses of honey or other bee products in your culture.
   - Suggest ways to protect and support bee populations in your area.
3. Include at least one personal anecdote or observation related to bees.
4. Use clear, descriptive language and organize your essay with an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.

## 4. Assignment Details

### Research Report on Traditional Beekeeping Practices

Objective: To document and preserve knowledge of traditional Timorese beekeeping or honey hunting practices.

Instructions:
1. Interview at least one elder in your community about their memories or knowledge of bees and honey.
2. Research additional information from books, articles, or online sources about traditional beekeeping in Timor-Leste.
3. Write a 1-2 page report (300-500 words) that includes:
   - A description of at least one traditional method of honey collection or bee management
   - The cultural significance of bees and honey in Timorese society
   - Any traditional beliefs or customs related to bees
   - How these practices have changed over time (if applicable)
4. Include a list of sources used (interviewees and any written sources).
5. Optional: Include drawings or photographs to illustrate the practices described.

Due date: [Insert appropriate date]

### Excerpt from "The Bees of Timor" by Maria Silva (fictional)

```
The forests of Timor have long buzzed with the gentle hum of bees. Our ancestors knew these industrious insects as more than mere honey-makers; they were messengers of the seasons, indicators of forest health, and bearers of sweetness in a sometimes harsh land.

In the village of Maubisse, old Jo√£o still climbs the tall ai-turi trees, following the path of his father and grandfather before him. With nothing but a smoldering bundle of ai-cafe leaves and his bare hands, he braves the dizzying heights to collect the golden combs of wild Apis cerana.

Meanwhile, in the lowland gardens of Suai, young Lucia tends to her boxes of stingless bees. These tiny trigona, no larger than a grain of rice, produce a tangy honey prized for its medicinal properties. Lucia learned the art of meliponiculture from her aunt, adapting ancient knowledge to modern conservation needs.

From the mountains to the coast, the bees of Timor continue their ancient dance with the flowers, a vital partnership that sustains both the land and its people.

### Pollination Activity Materials

- Flower templates: Cut out large paper "flowers" in different colors, with a central area to represent stamens and pistils.
- "Pollen": Use different colored powders (e.g., flour dyed with food coloring) to represent pollen from different flowers.
- "Bee" materials: Provide small pompoms or cotton balls for students to use as "bees" to transfer "pollen" between flowers.

Instructions for activity setup and facilitation to be provided separately.
