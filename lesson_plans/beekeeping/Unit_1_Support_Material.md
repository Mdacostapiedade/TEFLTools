## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Pollination**: The transfer of pollen from a male part of a plant to a female part of a plant, enabling fertilization and reproduction.
- **Ecosystem**: A community of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment.
- **Biodiversity**: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem.
- **Apis cerana**: Asian honey bee, a native species to Timor-Leste.
- **Trigona spp.**: A genus of stingless bees native to tropical and subtropical regions, including Timor-Leste.
- **Melliferous plants**: Plants that produce substances collected by bees to make honey.
- **Hive**: A structure where bees live and raise their young.
- **Colony**: A group of bees living together as a family unit.
- **Nectar**: A sweet liquid produced by plants to attract pollinators.
- **Pollen**: Fine powder produced by flowering plants, collected by bees as a protein source.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Bee Species Comparison Chart**: A large poster or digital slide showing side-by-side images of Apis cerana and Trigona spp., highlighting key physical differences and characteristics.

2. **Pollination Process Diagram**: An illustrated flowchart showing the steps of pollination, from a bee visiting a flower to the formation of fruit or seeds.

3. **Timorese Ecosystem Map**: A visual representation of Timor-Leste's diverse ecosystems, highlighting areas where different bee species are commonly found.

4. **Traditional vs. Modern Beekeeping Methods**: A split-image poster comparing traditional honey hunting techniques with modern beekeeping practices in Timor-Leste.

5. **Bee's Role in Agriculture**: An infographic showing the connection between bee pollination and common Timorese crops, with emphasis on coffee production.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Bee Identification Guide**: A single-page handout with images and key identifying features of Apis cerana and Trigona spp. for students to use during field observations.

2. **Field Observation Sheet**: A structured worksheet for students to record their observations during the field trip, including sections for bee species spotted, plant interactions, and general behavior notes.

3. **Pollination Matching Activity**: A worksheet where students match various Timorese crops with their pollinators, including bees and other insects.

4. **Traditional Knowledge Questionnaire**: A list of questions for students to use when interviewing community elders about traditional beekeeping practices.

5. **Bee-friendly Plant Guide**: A handout listing common melliferous plants in Timor-Leste, including their flowering seasons and preferred habitats.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Beekeeping in Asia" by Pongthep Akratanakul (FAO Agricultural Services Bulletin)
2. "Stingless Bees of Malaysia" by Mohd Mansor Ismail (online resource)
3. "The Asian Hive Bee: Apiculture, Biology, and Role in Sustainable Development in Tropical and Subtropical Asia" by D.W. Roubik
4. Local NGO resources on sustainable agriculture and beekeeping in Timor-Leste

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barriers**: Prepare key terms in both Tetum and Portuguese. Use visual aids extensively to overcome language limitations.

2. **Limited Prior Knowledge**: Start with very basic concepts and gradually build complexity. Use analogies to familiar agricultural practices when introducing new ideas.

3. **Cultural Sensitivities**: Respect traditional knowledge and practices. Integrate local wisdom with scientific information rather than presenting them as opposing views.

4. **Fear of Bees**: Address safety concerns upfront. Demonstrate proper protective gear use and safe behavior around bees. Have antihistamines available for potential allergic reactions.

5. **Limited Resources**: Be prepared to improvise with locally available materials. Encourage creative problem-solving when ideal equipment is not available.

6. **Varying Literacy Levels**: Use a mix of verbal, visual, and hands-on teaching methods to accommodate different learning styles and literacy levels.

7. **Environmental Challenges**: Be flexible with outdoor activities due to unpredictable weather. Have indoor backup plans for the field trip portion if needed.

8. **Maintaining Engagement**: Use interactive activities and real-life examples relevant to students' lives to keep the lesson engaging and applicable.
