# Learning Unit 2: Bee Biology and Behavior - Detailed Resources

## 1. Lecture Notes

### A. Bee Anatomy

#### Introduction
- Bees are insects belonging to the order Hymenoptera
- Three main body sections: head, thorax, abdomen

#### Head
- Contains sensory organs and brain
- Key features:
  * Compound eyes: thousands of tiny lenses for detecting movement and color
  * Simple eyes (ocelli): three small eyes on top of head for light detection
  * Antennae: for smell, touch, and detecting air movement
  * Mandibles: jaw-like structures for manipulating wax, pollen, and feeding larvae

#### Thorax
- Center of locomotion
- Attachments:
  * Two pairs of wings
  * Three pairs of legs
- Special features of legs:
  * Pollen baskets (corbiculae) on hind legs of workers
  * Antennae cleaners on front legs

#### Abdomen
- Contains digestive and reproductive organs
- Features:
  * Wax glands in worker bees
  * Stinger (modified ovipositor) in females
  * Honey stomach (crop) for nectar storage

### B. Bee Lifecycle

#### Overview
- Complete metamorphosis: egg, larva, pupa, adult
- Duration varies by caste and species

#### Stages
1. Egg
   - Laid by queen in cells
   - Hatches in 3 days
2. Larva
   - Fed by nurse bees
   - Molts several times
   - Duration: 5-6 days
3. Pupa
   - Cell is capped
   - Body transforms into adult form
   - Duration: 7-14 days depending on caste
4. Adult
   - Emerges by chewing through cell cap
   - Lifespan varies:
     * Queen: 2-5 years
     * Worker: 4-6 weeks (summer), 4-6 months (winter)
     * Drone: 4-8 weeks

### C. Colony Organization and Roles

#### Queen
- Only fully developed female
- Primary roles:
  * Egg laying (up to 2000 per day)
  * Pheromone production for colony cohesion

#### Workers
- Sterile females
- Roles change with age:
  1. Cell cleaning (1-2 days old)
  2. Nursing larvae (3-11 days old)
  3. Wax production and comb building (12-17 days old)
  4. Nectar receiving and packing (18-21 days old)
  5. Guarding hive entrance (22-24 days old)
  6. Foraging (25+ days old)

#### Drones
- Male bees
- Primary role: mating with queens from other colonies
- Do not work within the hive

### D. Bee Communication

#### Pheromones
- Chemical messages produced by queens and workers
- Functions:
  * Colony recognition
  * Alarm signals
  * Brood pheromones to stimulate feeding

#### Waggle Dance
- Performed by foragers to communicate food sources
- Conveys:
  * Distance to food source
  * Direction relative to sun
  * Quality of food source

#### Vibrations and Sounds
- Piping: queen sounds to assert dominance or prior to swarming
- Buzzing: communication and temperature regulation

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How do the anatomical features of bees relate to their roles in the colony?
2. Compare and contrast the lifecycles of queens, workers, and drones. How do these differences reflect their roles?
3. Discuss the advantages and potential disadvantages of age-based task allocation in worker bees.
4. How might the waggle dance have evolved as a communication method? What are its benefits and limitations?
5. In what ways do bees demonstrate collective intelligence within the hive?
6. How might understanding bee biology and behavior inform sustainable beekeeping practices?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. The Importance of Division of Labor in Bee Colonies
2. Comparing Communication Methods in Bees and Humans
3. The Role of the Queen Bee: Leader or Servant to the Colony?

Your essay should include:
- An introduction with a clear thesis statement
- At least three main points supported by evidence from the lecture and additional research
- A conclusion that summarizes your argument and its implications for beekeeping or ecology

## 4. Assignment Details

### Bee Lifecycle Comic Strip

Create a comic strip or storyboard illustrating the life cycle of a worker bee.

Requirements:
