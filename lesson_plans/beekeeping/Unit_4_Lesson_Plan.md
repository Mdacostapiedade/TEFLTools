Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 4: Creating Bee-Friendly Landscapes, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Creating Bee-Friendly Landscapes

## 1. Resources Needed

- Native plant samples or pictures
- Gardening tools (shovels, trowels, watering cans)
- Seedlings or seeds of native bee-friendly plants
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with local melliferous plant information
- Permaculture design principles poster
- Blank calendars for planting schedule activity

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify at least 5 native plants that support bee populations in Timor-Leste
- Explain the basic principles of permaculture design for bee-friendly gardens
- Create a planting calendar for year-round bee forage
- Design and begin planting a small bee garden

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Give each group a set of plant pictures (mix of native and non-native species)
- Ask groups to sort plants into "Bee-Friendly" and "Not Bee-Friendly" categories based on their current knowledge
- Discuss results as a class, noting any misconceptions to address later

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Melliferous plants
- Agroforestry
- Permaculture
- Bee forage
- Nectar flow
- Pollinator-friendly

Use visual aids and examples to reinforce understanding.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### a. Melliferous Plants of Timor-Leste (20 minutes)
- Present a slideshow or poster of important local bee-friendly plants
- Discuss characteristics that make plants attractive to bees
- Highlight the importance of native species

### b. Integrating Beekeeping with Agroforestry Systems (15 minutes)
- Explain the concept of agroforestry and its benefits
- Show examples of successful integration of beekeeping in agroforestry systems
- Discuss how this approach supports both bees and agricultural productivity

### c. Water Sources and Safe Habitats for Bees (10 minutes)
- Explain the importance of water for bees
- Demonstrate simple water source designs for bee gardens
- Discuss natural and artificial bee habitats

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### a. Plant Identification Game (15 minutes)
- Set up stations with plant samples or detailed pictures
- Have students rotate through stations, identifying plants and their bee-friendly characteristics

### b. Permaculture Design Principles Application (15 minutes)
- In small groups, give students a hypothetical garden space
- Ask them to apply permaculture principles to design a bee-friendly garden
- Groups present their designs to the class

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

### a. Create a Planting Calendar (30 minutes)
- Provide students with blank yearly calendars
- Using the information on local plants, have students create a planting schedule to ensure year-round bee forage
- Discuss and compare calendars as a class

### b. Design and Begin Planting a Bee Garden (30 minutes)
- Take students to the designated garden area at the training site
- In groups, have students design a small section of the garden
- Begin planting seedlings or seeds according to the designs

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap the key points of the lesson
- Have students share one new thing they learned and one question they still have
- Address any remaining questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a short report on one native Timorese plant that is beneficial for bees, including its flowering period, nectar production, and traditional uses
- Begin observing local gardens or natural areas, noting which plants attract the most bees

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Melliferous plants: Plants that produce substances collected by bees to make honey
- Agroforestry: A land use management system that combines trees or shrubs with crops or livestock
- Permaculture: A system of agricultural and social design principles centered on simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and features observed in natural ecosystems
- Bee forage: Plants that provide food for bees, including nectar and pollen sources
- Nectar flow: The period when one or more major nectar sources are in bloom and producing nectar
- Pollinator-friendly: Describing an environment or practice that supports and encourages pollinating insects, particularly bees
