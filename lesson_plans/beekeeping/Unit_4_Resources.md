# Resources for Learning Unit 4: Creating Bee-Friendly Landscapes

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Melliferous Plants of Timor-Leste

#### Introduction
- Definition: Melliferous plants are those that produce substances collected by bees to make honey
- Importance of native plants for local bee species

#### Key Melliferous Plants in Timor-Leste
1. Ai-dak (Schleichera oleosa)
   - Flowering period: August to October
   - Nectar production: High
   - Additional benefits: Provides shade, wood for construction

2. Ai-kafe (Coffea sp.)
   - Flowering period: September to November
   - Nectar production: Moderate
   - Additional benefits: Major cash crop, improved pollination increases yield

3. Ai-kakeu (Casuarina equisetifolia)
   - Flowering period: Year-round, peaks in dry season
   - Pollen production: High
   - Additional benefits: Nitrogen fixation, erosion control

4. Ai-teka (Tectona grandis)
   - Flowering period: June to September
   - Nectar production: Moderate
   - Additional benefits: Valuable timber, leaf mulch

5. Ai-dila (Psidium guajava)
   - Flowering period: April to June
   - Nectar production: High
   - Additional benefits: Fruit production, erosion control

#### Characteristics of Bee-Friendly Plants
- Open flower shapes for easy access
- Blue, purple, and yellow flowers (visible to bees)
- Fragrant blooms
- Variety of flower types to support different bee species

### Integrating Beekeeping with Agroforestry Systems

#### Agroforestry Basics
- Definition: Land use management system combining trees/shrubs with crops or livestock
- Benefits: Increased biodiversity, improved soil health, multiple income streams

#### Beekeeping in Agroforestry
- Placement of hives within agroforestry systems
- Selecting complementary crops and trees
- Managing for continuous bloom throughout the year

#### Case Study: Coffee Agroforestry with Beekeeping in Timor-Leste
- Integration of shade trees, coffee plants, and beehives
- Increased coffee yield through improved pollination
- Additional income from honey production

### Water Sources and Safe Habitats for Bees

#### Importance of Water for Bees
- Hydration for adult bees
- Temperature regulation in the hive
- Dilution of honey for feeding larvae

#### Designing Water Sources
- Shallow water with landing spots (pebbles, floating cork)
- Consistent water supply
- Placement near hives but not too close

#### Creating Safe Bee Habitats
- Undisturbed areas for ground-nesting bees
- Dead wood and hollow stems for cavity-nesting bees
- Reduced pesticide use in surrounding areas

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How does the use of native plants in bee-friendly landscapes support local ecosystems beyond just helping bees?

2. What challenges might arise when integrating beekeeping into existing agroforestry systems in Timor-Leste, and how could these be addressed?

3. How can traditional Timorese agricultural practices be combined with modern permaculture principles to create optimal bee habitats?

4. Discuss the potential economic impacts of widespread adoption of bee-friendly landscaping practices in Timor-Leste.

5. How might climate change affect the flowering patterns of melliferous plants in Timor-Leste, and what adaptations might be necessary for beekeepers?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay proposing a bee-friendly landscape design for a small community garden in your local area. Include the following elements:

- A list of at least 5 native melliferous plants to be included, with their flowering periods
- A description of how the garden layout follows permaculture principles
- An explanation of how the design provides year-round forage for bees
- A plan for integrating water sources and safe habitats for bees
- A brief discussion of how the garden could benefit both the local community and bee populations

## 4. Assignment Details

### Planting Calendar Creation

1. Using the provided blank yearly calendar, mark the flowering periods for at least 10 melliferous plants native to Timor-Leste.
2. Color-code the calendar to indicate periods of high, moderate, and low nectar availability.
3. Identify any gaps in the nectar flow and suggest additional plants that could be added to ensure year-round forage.
4. Write a short paragraph explaining your strategy for maintaining consistent bee forage throughout the year.

### Bee Garden Design and Planting

1. In groups of 3-4, design a small (3m x 3m) bee-friendly garden for the training site.
2. Create a detailed planting plan, including:
   - A list of plants with their scientific and local names
   - A diagram showing the layout of plants
   - Explanations for why each plant was chosen and its placement
3. Implement your design by planting seedlings or seeds in the designated area.
4. Prepare a short presentation (5 minutes) explaining your design choices and how they benefit bees.

## 5. Additional Materials

### Permaculture Principles for Bee-Friendly Gardens

1. Observe and interact: Study local bee species and their preferences
2. Catch and store energy: Use water-saving techniques, mulch to retain moisture
3. Obtain a yield: Include edible plants that also benefit bees
4. Apply self-regulation and accept feedback: Monitor plant health and bee activity, adjust as needed
5. Use and value renewable resources: Incorporate native plants, use local materials for structures
6. Produce no waste: Compost plant trimmings, use natural pest control methods
7. Design from patterns to details: Plan for year-round blooming, create diverse plant communities
8. Integrate rather than segregate: Mix flower types, heights, and blooming periods
9. Use small and slow solutions: Start with a small area, expand gradually
10. Use and value diversity: Include a wide variety of plant species to support different bee types
11. Use edges and value the marginal: Create border plantings, use vertical spaces
12. Creatively use and respond to change: Adapt plant choices based on changing climate conditions

### Example Bee-Friendly Garden Layout

```
[Diagram of a 3m x 3m garden plot with the following elements:]

1. Tall native trees at corners (e.g., Ai-dak)
2. Medium-height shrubs along edges (e.g., Ai-dila)
3. Flowering ground cover in center (e.g., native legumes)
4. Herb spiral near one edge
5. Small pond with shallow edges and pebbles
6. Log or bundle of hollow stems for bee nesting
7. Mulched pathways between planting areas
```

This layout incorporates vertical layering, diverse plant types, water source, and nesting habitats for bees.
