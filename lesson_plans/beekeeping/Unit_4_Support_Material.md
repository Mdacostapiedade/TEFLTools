# Support Material for Creating Bee-Friendly Landscapes

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Melliferous plants**: Plants that produce substances collected by bees to make honey
- **Agroforestry**: A land use management system that combines trees or shrubs with crops or livestock
- **Permaculture**: A system of agricultural and social design principles centered on simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and features observed in natural ecosystems
- **Bee forage**: Plants that provide food for bees, including nectar and pollen sources
- **Nectar flow**: The period when one or more major nectar sources are in bloom and producing nectar
- **Pollinator-friendly**: Describing an environment or practice that supports and encourages pollinating insects, particularly bees
- **Native species**: Plants that naturally occur in a particular region without human intervention
- **Biodiversity**: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Bee-Friendly Plant Identification Chart**: A poster showing images of common native bee-friendly plants in Timor-Leste, with their local and scientific names, flowering periods, and bee attractiveness rating.

2. **Permaculture Design Principles Diagram**: A visual representation of key permaculture principles applied to bee-friendly garden design, including zones, water management, and plant guilds.

3. **Bee Foraging Calendar**: A circular diagram showing the flowering periods of major bee-friendly plants throughout the year in Timor-Leste, helping students visualize the concept of year-round forage.

4. **Agroforestry and Beekeeping Integration Model**: A cross-section diagram showing how beehives can be integrated into different layers of an agroforestry system, from ground cover to canopy.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Native Melliferous Plants of Timor-Leste**: A table listing local bee-friendly plants, their flowering periods, nectar production levels, and traditional uses.

2. **Bee Garden Design Worksheet**: A blank garden layout grid with a checklist of bee-friendly garden elements (water source, diverse plant types, nesting areas) for students to use in their design activity.

3. **Year-Round Bee Forage Planner**: A blank 12-month calendar template for students to fill in with appropriate plants to ensure continuous bee forage throughout the year.

4. **Permaculture Principles Application Guide**: A worksheet with scenarios of different garden spaces and prompts for students to apply permaculture principles in creating bee-friendly designs.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Native Bees of Timor-Leste: A Field Guide" (local publication)
2. "Permaculture Design for Small Farms and Homesteads" by Bill Mollison
3. "The Bee-Friendly Garden" by Kate Frey and Gretchen LeBuhn
4. Online course: "Introduction to Permaculture" by the Permaculture Research Institute
5. Local beekeepers' association contact list for mentorship opportunities

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited knowledge of native plants.
   **Solution**: Provide a comprehensive local plant guide and organize a field trip to a botanical garden or nature reserve to observe plants in their natural setting.

2. **Challenge**: Applying permaculture principles may be new and complex for some students.
   **Solution**: Use simplified diagrams and real-life examples. Consider inviting a local permaculture practitioner as a guest speaker.

3. **Challenge**: Limited access to gardening space for practical activities.
   **Solution**: Use container gardening demonstrations or partner with local community gardens for hands-on experience.

4. **Challenge**: Varying levels of gardening experience among students.
   **Solution**: Implement a buddy system pairing experienced gardeners with novices during activities.

5. **Challenge**: Difficulty in visualizing year-round planting schedules.
   **Solution**: Use interactive digital tools or large physical calendars with movable plant cards to make the planning process more tangible and engaging.

6. **Challenge**: Potential cultural resistance to changing traditional farming practices.
   **Solution**: Emphasize the connection between proposed methods and traditional ecological knowledge. Highlight success stories from local farmers who have adopted bee-friendly practices.
