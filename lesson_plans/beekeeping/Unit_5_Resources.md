# Resources for Learning Unit 5: Hive Management - Dry Season

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Topic: Inspecting Hives Safely

#### Introduction
- Importance of regular hive inspections during the dry season
- Safety considerations for beekeepers and bees

#### Proper Protective Gear
- Full suit or jacket with veil
- Gloves
- Closed-toe shoes
- Importance of light-colored clothing

#### Using a Smoker
- How smoke calms bees
- Proper fuel for smokers (dry leaves, cardboard, wood shavings)
- Technique for applying smoke to the hive

#### Hive Inspection Procedure
1. Approach hive from the side or back
2. Apply smoke to entrance and under cover
3. Wait 30 seconds before opening
4. Remove cover and apply smoke to top bars
5. Carefully remove and inspect frames
6. Look for:
   - Queen presence (eggs, larvae)
   - Food stores
   - Signs of disease or pests
   - Unusual behavior
7. Reassemble hive carefully
8. Record observations

#### Safety Tips
- Work calmly and deliberately
- Avoid crushing bees
- Be aware of weather conditions
- Have an escape plan in case of aggressive behavior

### Topic: Managing Water Resources for Bees

#### Importance of Water for Bees
- Cooling the hive
- Diluting honey for feeding larvae
- Processing pollen into bee bread

#### Natural Water Sources
- Streams, ponds, dew on leaves
- Challenges during dry season

#### Creating Artificial Water Sources
- Shallow dishes with pebbles or floating cork
- Drip systems
- Bird baths with landing spots

#### Water Quality
- Clean, fresh water essential
- Avoid contaminated or stagnant sources

#### Placement of Water Sources
- Near hives (within 50 meters)
- Away from human activity
- In shaded areas to prevent evaporation

### Topic: Preventing Absconding During Harsh Conditions

#### Causes of Absconding
- Lack of food or water
- Excessive heat
- Pest infestations
- Disturbance

#### Signs of Potential Absconding
- Reduced foraging activity
- Clustering of bees at hive entrance
- Unusual agitation within the hive

#### Prevention Strategies
1. Ensure adequate food stores
   - Supplemental feeding if necessary
2. Provide consistent water source
3. Improve hive ventilation
   - Additional entrance or ventilation holes
4. Provide shade for hives
   - Natural shade or artificial covers
5. Reduce stress factors
   - Minimize inspections during hottest parts of day
6. Maintain pest control measures

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How does the dry season in Timor-Leste affect local bee populations? What are the main challenges bees face during this time?

2. Why is proper protective gear crucial when inspecting hives? Discuss potential risks of inadequate protection.

3. How does smoke affect bee behavior, and why is it useful during hive inspections?

4. What are the key elements to look for during a dry season hive inspection? How do these differ from wet season inspections?

5. Discuss the various ways bees use water in the hive. How can beekeepers ensure their colonies have access to clean water during the dry season?

6. What are the signs that a colony might be preparing to abscond? How can beekeepers intervene to prevent this?

7. How might traditional Timorese beekeeping practices address dry season challenges? Are there lessons we can learn from these methods?

8. Discuss the balance between necessary hive management and minimizing disturbance to the colony during harsh conditions.

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Imagine you are a beekeeper in Timor-Leste facing an unusually long and severe dry season. Describe the challenges you anticipate for your bee colonies and outline a management plan to help them survive. Include specific strategies for water provision, food supplementation if necessary, and measures to prevent absconding. Consider both modern beekeeping techniques and any relevant traditional practices."

Your essay should include:
- An introduction outlining the situation
- At least three main challenges and corresponding management strategies
- A conclusion summarizing your approach
- References to course materials and any additional research

## 4. Assignment Details

### Practical Hive Inspection Exercise

In groups of 3-4, students will perform a complete hive inspection on a training hive. Each group will:

1. Properly dress in protective gear
2. Prepare and use a smoker
3. Open the hive and inspect each frame
4. Identify the queen (or signs of queen presence)
5. Assess food stores
6. Check for signs of pests or disease
7. Evaluate overall colony health
8. Close the hive properly
9. Record observations on a provided inspection sheet

Each group will then present their findings to the class, discussing any concerns and proposed management actions.

### Water Feeder Construction Project

Individually or in pairs, students will design and construct a water feeder suitable for bee colonies during the dry season. The project should:

1. Use locally available, low-cost materials
2. Provide a safe landing area for bees
3. Hold enough water for at least one day
4. Be easy to clean and refill
5. Include some method to reduce evaporation

Students will present their feeders to the class, explaining their design choices and how the feeder addresses the needs of bees during the dry season.

## 5. Additional Materials

### Visual Aid: Signs of Water Stress in Bees

[A detailed illustration or photograph showing]:
- Bees clustering around water sources
- Reduced foraging activity
- Fanning behavior at hive entrance
- Bees collecting water from unusual sources (e.g., condensation, fruit)

### Handout: Dry Season Management Checklist

1. Weekly hive inspections
   - Check food stores
   - Assess queen performance
   - Monitor for pests and diseases
2. Daily water source check
   - Clean and refill artificial water sources
   - Ensure easy access for bees
3. Ventilation management
   - Adjust hive entrances as needed
   - Add shade if necessary
4. Supplemental feeding (if required)
   - Prepare sugar syrup (1:1 ratio)
   - Use appropriate feeder type
5. Pest monitoring
   - Check for small hive beetles
   - Monitor for signs of wax moth
6. Absconding prevention
   - Address any signs of preparation
   - Ensure colony comfort
7. Record keeping
   - Document all observations and actions
