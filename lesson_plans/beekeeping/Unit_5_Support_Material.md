# Support Material: Hive Management - Dry Season

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Absconding**: When an entire bee colony abandons its hive due to unfavorable conditions.
- **Dearth period**: A time when nectar and pollen are scarce in the environment.
- **Nectar flow**: The time when flowers are producing nectar and bees are actively foraging.
- **Propolis**: A resinous mixture collected by bees and used to seal small gaps in the hive.
- **Ventilation**: The circulation of air within the hive, important for temperature and humidity control.
- **Water stress**: A condition where bees lack sufficient water, affecting their ability to regulate hive temperature and process food.
- **Foraging**: The act of bees collecting nectar, pollen, water, or propolis from the environment.
- **Brood**: Developing bees (eggs, larvae, and pupae) in the hive.
- **Bearding**: When bees cluster outside the hive entrance, often due to heat or overcrowding.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Signs of Water Stress in Bees**: A poster showing:
   - Bees clustering around water sources
   - Reduced foraging activity
   - Bees fanning at the hive entrance more than usual
   - Brood pattern becoming spotty or irregular

2. **Proper Hive Ventilation**: Diagram of a hive showing:
   - Correct placement of ventilation holes
   - Air flow patterns within the hive
   - Comparison of well-ventilated vs. poorly ventilated hives

3. **Simple Water Feeder Design**: Step-by-step illustrations for creating a water feeder using:
   - A shallow dish
   - Pebbles or corks for bee landing spots
   - Proper placement near the hive

4. **Absconding Prevention Techniques**: Visual representation of:
   - Providing shade for hives
   - Ensuring proper ventilation
   - Maintaining water sources
   - Supplemental feeding methods

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Dry Season Hive Inspection Checklist**:
   - Date and time of inspection
   - Weather conditions
   - Presence of queen (eggs seen?)
   - Brood pattern and health
   - Food stores (honey and pollen)
   - Signs of pests or diseases
   - Water availability
   - Hive ventilation status
   - Actions taken during inspection

2. **Water Source Identification Worksheet**:
   - List potential water sources near the apiary
   - Evaluate each source for safety and accessibility
   - Plan for creating or improving water sources

3. **Dry Season Management Plan Template**:
   - Hive location and number
   - Shade provision strategy
   - Water management plan
   - Feeding schedule (if necessary)
   - Ventilation adjustments
   - Pest monitoring approach
   - Emergency response plan for extreme conditions

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Beekeeping in Hot Climates" by Friedrich Ruttner (FAO Agricultural Services Bulletin)
2. "Top-Bar Beekeeping in Tropical Climates" by Thomas D. Seeley
3. Local agricultural extension office resources on drought management for beekeepers
4. Online forum or social media group for Timorese beekeepers to share experiences and advice
5. Video series on traditional water management techniques in Timor-Leste that can be adapted for beekeeping

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students afraid of bee stings during hive inspections.
   **Solution**: Emphasize proper protective gear use, demonstrate calm movements, and allow nervous students to observe from a safe distance initially.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to modern beekeeping equipment.
   **Solution**: Focus on locally-available alternatives and traditional methods. Encourage creativity in adapting materials.

3. **Challenge**: Varying literacy levels among students.
   **Solution**: Use plenty of visual aids, hands-on demonstrations, and peer teaching to accommodate all learning styles.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in finding a suitable demonstration hive.
   **Solution**: Consider setting up a small apiary at the teaching site or partnering with a local beekeeper for field visits.

5. **Challenge**: Students struggling to identify subtle signs of hive stress.
   **Solution**: Provide ample practice time with guided observations. Use comparison photos or videos to highlight differences between healthy and stressed colonies.

6. **Challenge**: Lack of prior knowledge about local flowering patterns.
   **Solution**: Engage students in creating a community-sourced flowering calendar as an ongoing project throughout the course.
