# Resources for Learning Unit 6: Hive Management - Wet Season

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Protecting Hives from Excess Moisture

#### Introduction
- The wet season in Timor-Leste presents unique challenges for beekeepers
- Excess moisture can lead to mold, fungal growth, and weakened colonies

#### Key Moisture Management Techniques
1. Proper Hive Placement
   - Choose elevated ground to avoid flooding
   - Ensure good air circulation around hives
   - Use stands to keep hives off the ground

2. Hive Ventilation
   - Importance of proper air flow within the hive
   - Methods to increase ventilation:
     * Adding ventilation holes
     * Using screened bottom boards
     * Propping up hive covers slightly

3. Water-Resistant Hive Covers
   - Traditional materials: palm leaves, woven bamboo
   - Modern alternatives: corrugated metal, plastic sheeting
   - Importance of overhang to direct water away from hive entrance

4. Moisture Absorption
   - Using natural absorbent materials inside hives
     * Dry banana leaves
     * Coconut husk fibers
   - Regular replacement of damp materials

5. Regular Inspections
   - Checking for water ingress
   - Identifying and addressing damp areas promptly

### Swarm Behavior and Capture Techniques

#### Understanding Swarm Behavior
- Natural reproduction method for honey bee colonies
- Triggered by:
  * Overcrowding in the hive
  * Abundance of resources
  * Seasonal patterns

#### Swarm Process
1. Preparation
   - Queen stops laying eggs
   - Workers create queen cups
   - Reduced foraging activity

2. Swarm Departure
   - Queen leaves with about 60% of worker bees
   - Cluster formation near the original hive

3. Scout Bee Activity
   - Scouts search for suitable new home locations
   - Decision-making process through bee "democracy"

4. Swarm Movement
   - Entire swarm moves to chosen location
   - Establishment of new colony

#### Capture Techniques
1. Safety First
   - Proper protective gear
   - Assessing swarm location and accessibility

2. Timing
   - Best done in early morning or late afternoon
   - Avoid rainy or extremely hot conditions

3. Capture Methods
   - Shake or brush into a capture box
   - Use of swarm traps with lures
   - Cutting and lowering branch (if applicable)

4. Securing the Queen
   - Importance of capturing the queen
   - Using queen cages when necessary

5. Transporting the Swarm
   - Ensuring proper ventilation during transport
   - Keeping swarm cool and undisturbed

### Splitting Hives for Increase

#### Benefits of Hive Splitting
- Controlled colony reproduction
- Swarm prevention
- Increase in hive numbers

#### Methods of Splitting
1. Walk-Away Split
   - Dividing brood and resources equally
   - Allowing one half to raise a new queen

2. Artificial Swarm
   - Moving old queen to new hive with foragers
   - Original hive raises new queen

3. Nucleus Colony Creation
   - Creating small colonies from larger ones
   - Using for queen rearing or gradual expansion

#### Timing for Splits
- Best done during nectar flow
- Ensuring adequate resources for both colonies
- Considering local seasonal patterns

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How might climate change affect wet season beekeeping practices in Timor-Leste?
2. Compare traditional Timorese methods of moisture control in hives with modern techniques. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
3. Discuss the ethical considerations of capturing wild swarms versus allowing them to establish naturally in the environment.
4. How can beekeepers balance the desire for hive increase through splitting with the need to maintain strong, productive colonies?
5. In what ways might swarm behavior differ between Apis cerana and Apis mellifera? How would this impact capture techniques?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. Develop a comprehensive wet season management plan for a small apiary in Timor-Leste, addressing moisture control, swarm management, and potential challenges.
2. Compare and contrast natural swarming with artificial hive splitting, discussing the pros and cons of each method for colony increase.
3. Explore the potential impacts of intensive swarm capture on local bee populations and biodiversity. Propose guidelines for sustainable swarm management in Timor-Leste.

## 4. Assignment Details

### Practical Swarm Capture Plan

Objective: Create a detailed plan for capturing and hiving a swarm in your local area.

Instructions:
1. Research local swarm patterns and timing in your region of Timor-Leste.
2. Design a swarm capture kit using locally available materials.
3. Create a step-by-step procedure for safe swarm capture, including:
   - Safety precautions
   - Equipment needed
   - Capture technique
   - Transportation method
   - Hiving process
4. Develop a simple record-keeping system to document swarm captures.
5. Present your plan to the class, explaining your choices and reasoning.

Submission: A written plan (1000-1500 words) and a 10-minute presentation.

## 5. Additional Materials

### Local Plant Guide for Swarm Lures

Create a list of 5-10 local Timorese plants known to attract honey bee swarms. For each plant, include:
- Common name (in Tetum and English)
- Scientific name
- Brief description
- How to use it as a swarm lure

Example:
```
1. Ai-dak (Schleichera oleosa)
   - English: Kusum
   - Description: Large tree with compound leaves and small fragrant flowers
   - Use: Crush leaves and rub inside swarm trap or hive boxes to attract bees
```

### Swarm Capture Checklist

Provide a printable checklist for students to use when preparing for and executing a swarm capture:

- [ ] Protective gear (suit, gloves, veil)
- [ ] Capture box or nucleus hive
- [ ] Pruning shears
- [ ] Bee brush
- [ ] Spray bottle with sugar water
- [ ] Queen cage
- [ ] White sheet or tarp
- [ ] Rope or straps for securing hive components
- [ ] First aid kit
- [ ] Mobile phone (for emergencies)
- [ ] (Add other locally relevant items)

By providing these detailed resources, students will have comprehensive materials to support their learning about wet season hive management, swarm behavior, and capture techniques in the context of Timorese beekeeping.
