Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Hive Management - Wet Season, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Hive Management - Wet Season

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Swarm**: A group of bees, led by a queen, that leaves the parent colony to establish a new one.
- **Absconding**: When an entire colony abandons their hive due to unfavorable conditions.
- **Ventilation**: The circulation of air within the hive to control temperature and humidity.
- **Queen cup**: A special cell built by worker bees where a new queen can be raised.
- **Scout bees**: Worker bees that search for and assess potential new nest sites for a swarm.
- **Artificial swarming**: A beekeeper-induced process of creating new colonies, often through hive splitting.
- **Hive splitting**: The process of dividing a strong colony into two or more separate colonies.
- **Propolis**: A resinous mixture collected by bees from tree buds, used to seal small gaps in the hive.
- **Nectar flow**: The period when nectar-producing flowers are in bloom and bees are actively foraging.
- **Brood chamber**: The part of the hive where the queen lays eggs and young bees are raised.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Swarm Behavior Diagram**: A visual representation showing the stages of swarming, from queen cup formation to the establishment of a new colony. Include illustrations of:
   - Bees building queen cups
   - The old queen leaving with a portion of the colony
   - Scout bees searching for a new home
   - The swarm clustered on a branch
   - The swarm moving into a new cavity

2. **Hive Ventilation Poster**: A cross-section diagram of a hive showing proper ventilation techniques for wet season management. Include:
   - Entrance reducers with ventilation holes
   - Top ventilation methods (e.g., propped outer cover)
   - Screened bottom board
   - Arrows indicating airflow patterns

3. **Swarm Capture Equipment Chart**: A visual guide displaying and labeling essential swarm capture tools:
   - Bee brush
   - Capture box or nuc box
   - Queen cage
   - Pruning shears
   - Ladder
   - Spray bottle with sugar water

4. **Hive Splitting Infographic**: A step-by-step visual guide showing the process of splitting a hive, including:
   - Inspecting the parent hive
   - Preparing new hive equipment
   - Transferring frames of brood, honey, and pollen
   - Adding a new queen or queen cell to the queenless split

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Wet Season Hive Management Checklist**:
   - A list of tasks for beekeepers to perform during regular hive inspections in the wet season
   - Includes items like checking for moisture buildup, assessing ventilation, inspecting for queen cups, etc.

2. **Swarm Prevention Worksheet**:
   - A fillable form for students to create a swarm prevention plan for their hives
   - Includes sections on hive expansion, queen management, and nectar flow monitoring

3. **Swarm Capture Safety Protocol**:
   - A step-by-step guide outlining safety procedures for capturing swarms
   - Emphasizes personal protective equipment and assessing risks before attempting capture

4. **Hive Splitting Planning Sheet**:
   - A worksheet to help students plan a hive split, including a checklist of necessary equipment and a timeline for the splitting process

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Swarm Essentials: Ecology, Management, Sustainability" by Stephen J. Repasky
2. "The Practical Beekeeper: Beekeeping Naturally" by Michael Bush (sections on swarm management)
3. Online video series: "Swarm Capture Techniques for Tropical Climates" (to be created in Tetum)
4. Local beekeepers' association swarm removal service contact list
5. Mobile app for tracking swarm reports in the community (to be developed)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may be afraid of handling swarms.
   **Solution**: Start with simulated swarms using clusters of non-stinging bees or bee replicas. Gradually introduce students to live swarms under close supervision.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to real swarms during the lesson period.
   **Solution**: Use video recordings of swarm captures and create mock scenarios for students to practice decision-making and capture techniques.

3. **Challenge**: Varying levels of comfort with bee handling among students.
   **Solution**: Pair more experienced students with less confident ones during practical exercises. Provide extra protective gear for those who need additional reassurance.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in explaining complex bee behaviors.
   **Solution**: Use role-playing activities where students act out the roles of different bees during swarming to make the concept more tangible.

5. **Challenge**: Limited resources for hive splitting demonstrations.
   **Solution**: If live hives are not available, create a model hive using boxes and frames to demonstrate the splitting process. Use pictures or videos to show actual brood patterns and bee distributions.

6. **Challenge**: Students struggling to identify queen cups during inspections.
   **Solution**: Provide clear, close-up photographs of queen cups at various stages of development. If possible, keep preserved specimens of queen cups for hands-on examination.

7. **Challenge**: Ensuring proper ventilation techniques are understood and applied.
   **Solution**: Create a small-scale model hive that allows students to practice adjusting ventilation features. Conduct before-and-after humidity tests to demonstrate effectiveness.
