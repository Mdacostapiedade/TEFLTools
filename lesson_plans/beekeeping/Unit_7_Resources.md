# Resources for Learning Unit 7: Pest and Disease Management

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Common Pests in Timorese Beekeeping

#### Varroa Mites
- Scientific name: Varroa destructor
- Appearance: Reddish-brown, flat, oval-shaped, about 1-1.5mm wide
- Life cycle:
  * Mites enter brood cells before capping
  * Female mites lay eggs in the cell
  * Mites feed on developing bee larvae and pupae
- Impact:
  * Weakens bees, shortens lifespan
  * Vectors for viruses
  * Can lead to colony collapse if untreated

#### Small Hive Beetles
- Scientific name: Aethina tumida
- Appearance: Dark brown to black, about 5-7mm long
- Life cycle:
  * Adults lay eggs in cracks of hive
  * Larvae feed on honey, pollen, and brood
  * Pupate in soil outside the hive
- Impact:
  * Contaminate honey
  * Damage combs
  * Can cause bees to abandon hive

#### Wax Moths
- Common species: Greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella)
- Appearance: Gray moths, larvae are white with brown heads
- Life cycle:
  * Moths lay eggs in hive cracks
  * Larvae tunnel through combs, feeding on wax and pollen
  * Pupate in cocoons on hive surfaces
- Impact:
  * Destroy combs
  * Weaken hive structure
  * More problematic in weak colonies

### Diseases Relevant to Apis cerana and Trigona spp.

#### Chalkbrood
- Caused by fungus Ascosphaera apis
- Affects Apis cerana, less common in Trigona spp.
- Symptoms:
  * Mummified larvae in cells, chalky white to gray
  * Often seen at hive entrance
- Prevention:
  * Maintain strong colonies
  * Ensure good hive ventilation

#### Nosema
- Microsporidian parasite
- Affects adult bees of both Apis and Trigona species
- Symptoms:
  * Dysentery
  * Reduced lifespan of adult bees
  * Slow spring build-up
- Prevention:
  * Good hive hygiene
  * Avoid moisture build-up in hives

### Herbal and Cultural Control Methods

#### Herbal Treatments
1. Tobacco Infusion
   - Effective against varroa mites
   - Preparation:
     * Soak 100g dried tobacco leaves in 1L water for 24 hours
     * Strain and dilute 1:1 with sugar syrup
     * Apply by spraying on combs or in sugar syrup feeder

2. Neem Oil Solution
   - Repels various pests
   - Preparation:
     * Mix 5ml neem oil with 1L water and a drop of liquid soap
     * Spray on hive exterior and around hive entrance

#### Cultural Control Methods
1. Hive Design and Maintenance
   - Use locally adapted top-bar hives
   - Ensure proper ventilation
   - Keep hives off the ground to deter pests

2. Regular Inspections
   - Check hives every 2-3 weeks
   - Look for signs of pests or disease
   - Remove and destroy infested combs

3. Maintain Strong Colonies
   - Ensure adequate food stores
   - Requeen when necessary
   - Combine weak colonies

4. Trap Crops for Pests
   - Plant pest-attractive plants away from hives
   - Example: Castor bean plants attract wax moths

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How do the common bee pests in Timor-Leste differ from those in other regions? Why might this be the case?

2. Discuss the pros and cons of using chemical treatments versus herbal and cultural control methods for pest management in beekeeping.

3. How might climate change affect the prevalence and impact of bee pests and diseases in Timor-Leste?

4. What role does traditional ecological knowledge play in pest management for Timorese beekeepers? How can we integrate this knowledge with modern beekeeping practices?

5. How can beekeepers balance the need for pest control with the importance of maintaining a natural, chemical-free hive environment?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Develop an integrated pest management (IPM) plan for a small-scale beekeeping operation in Timor-Leste. Include preventive measures, monitoring techniques, and treatment options using locally available resources. Discuss how this plan aligns with permaculture principles and supports sustainable beekeeping practices."

Your essay should include:
- An introduction explaining the importance of pest management in beekeeping
- At least three specific preventive measures
- A monitoring schedule and techniques
- At least two treatment options using local resources
- A conclusion discussing how the plan supports sustainability

## 4. Assignment Details

### Pest Identification and Management Project

Objective: To develop practical skills in identifying and managing bee pests and diseases.

Instructions:
1. Form groups of 3-4 students.
2. Each group will be assigned a common bee pest or disease relevant to Timor-Leste.
3. Research your assigned pest/disease, focusing on:
   - Identification (appearance, signs of infestation)
   - Life cycle
   - Impact on bee colonies
   - Prevention methods
   - Treatment options (emphasizing natural and locally available methods)
4. Create an educational poster or infographic about your pest/disease.
5. Develop a hands-on demonstration or activity to teach others about managing this pest/disease.
6. Present your poster and demonstration to the class (10-15 minutes per group).

Deliverables:
- Educational poster or infographic
- Written report (1000-1500 words) detailing your research findings
- Demonstration materials
- Group presentation

Due date: End of the following week
