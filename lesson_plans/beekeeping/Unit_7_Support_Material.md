## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Pest Identification Chart**: 
   - Description: A visual chart showing clear images of varroa mites, small hive beetles, and wax moths in various life stages. Each pest is labeled and accompanied by a brief description of its identifying features.

2. **Signs of Infestation Infographic**:
   - Description: An infographic illustrating the signs of pest infestation in a hive. This includes images of damaged combs, bee behavior changes, and visible pests on bees or in the hive.

3. **IPM Strategy Diagram**:
   - Description: A circular diagram showing the components of an Integrated Pest Management strategy, including prevention, monitoring, cultural controls, and treatment options.

4. **Herbal Treatment Preparation Guide**:
   - Description: Step-by-step visual guide showing the preparation of a natural treatment, such as a tobacco infusion. Includes images of required materials and each preparation step.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Pest Identification Checklist**:
   - Content: A checklist for students to use during hive inspections. Includes sections for each common pest, with boxes to tick off observed signs and a space for notes.

2. **IPM Planning Worksheet**:
   - Content: A template for students to create their own Integrated Pest Management plan. Includes sections for preventive measures, monitoring schedules, and treatment options for each season.

3. **Herbal Treatment Recipe Card**:
   - Content: Recipe cards for various herbal treatments using local plants. Each card includes ingredients, preparation instructions, application methods, and safety precautions.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Pests, Predators, and Diseases of Honey Bees in Asia" by Friedrich Ruttner
2. "Natural Beekeeping: Organic Approaches to Modern Apiculture" by Ross Conrad
3. Online course: "Integrated Pest Management for Beekeepers" by University of Florida Extension
4. Local resource: "Traditional Pest Management Practices in Timorese Beekeeping" (a compilation of local knowledge to be developed)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have difficulty identifying small pests like varroa mites.
   - **Solution**: Provide magnifying glasses and prepare slides with mites for microscope viewing. Use large, clear images in presentations.

2. **Challenge**: Some students may be uncomfortable handling bees during hive inspections.
   - **Solution**: Pair less confident students with more experienced ones. Ensure proper protective gear is available and demonstrate calm, confident behavior around bees.

3. **Challenge**: Preparing herbal treatments may be messy or time-consuming.
   - **Solution**: Pre-measure ingredients and set up workstations before class. Consider preparing some treatments in advance to demonstrate the final product.

4. **Challenge**: Students may rely too heavily on treatments rather than preventive measures.
   - **Solution**: Emphasize the importance of prevention in lectures and activities. Include a section in the IPM plan specifically for preventive strategies.

5. **Challenge**: Local plant knowledge for treatments may vary among students.
   - **Solution**: Create a collaborative class resource of local plants and their uses in beekeeping. Invite a local expert to share traditional knowledge.
