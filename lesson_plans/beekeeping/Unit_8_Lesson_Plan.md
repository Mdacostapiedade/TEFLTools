Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 8: Harvesting and Processing Bee Products, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Harvesting and Processing Bee Products

## 1. Resources Needed

- Beekeeping protective gear for all students
- Smoker and fuel
- Hive tool
- Top-bar hive with mature honey
- Honey extraction equipment (buckets, strainers, jars)
- Beeswax processing materials (solar wax melter or double boiler)
- Handouts on honey harvesting and processing steps
- Visual aids (posters or slides) showing harvesting techniques

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Demonstrate safe and sustainable honey harvesting techniques
- Explain the process of extracting and bottling honey without contamination
- Describe methods for collecting and processing beeswax
- Understand the importance of proper storage and handling of bee products

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Taste test: Provide samples of different local honeys
- Students discuss and compare flavors, colors, and textures
- Brief discussion on how different flower sources affect honey characteristics

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Uncapping
- Extraction
- Straining
- Crystallization
- Rendering (for beeswax)

Use visual aids and real tools to demonstrate each term.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Traditional and Modern Harvesting Methods
- Explain and compare traditional Timorese honey hunting vs. modern beekeeping harvesting
- Discuss sustainable practices and their importance

### Honey Harvesting Process
- Step-by-step explanation of harvesting from a top-bar hive
- Safety precautions and best practices
- Demonstrate proper use of smoker and hive tool

### Honey Processing and Storage
- Methods of extraction: crushing and straining, simple extractor
- Importance of proper moisture content
- Bottling and labeling practices
- Storage conditions to maintain quality

### Beeswax Collection and Uses
- Identifying harvestable wax
- Methods of rendering wax
- Common uses of beeswax in Timor-Leste

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Rotate through stations:
  1. Hive inspection and frame selection for harvest
  2. Uncapping and extracting honey
  3. Straining and bottling honey
  4. Collecting and cleaning beeswax

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Each group processes a small batch of honey from start to finish
- Create labels for honey jars, including harvest date and floral source
- Begin rendering a batch of beeswax

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Group discussion on challenges faced during the harvesting and processing activities
- Q&A session to address any uncertainties
- Quick quiz on key steps and safety measures in honey harvesting

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and document traditional Timorese uses for honey and beeswax
- Design an infographic or poster explaining the honey harvesting process for community education

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Uncapping: Removing the wax cappings from honey cells to allow extraction
- Extraction: The process of removing honey from the comb
- Straining: Filtering honey to remove wax particles and other debris
- Crystallization: The natural process of honey changing from liquid to a semi-solid state
- Rendering: Melting and purifying beeswax to remove impurities
