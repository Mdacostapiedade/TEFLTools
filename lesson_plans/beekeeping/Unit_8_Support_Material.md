## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Safety Concerns**: 
   - Ensure all students are properly dressed in protective gear before approaching hives
   - Have a first aid kit on hand and know how to use it for bee stings
   - Conduct a safety briefing at the start of practical sessions

2. **Limited Resources**:
   - Encourage sharing of equipment among small groups
   - Demonstrate alternative methods using locally available materials
   - Rotate students through different activities to maximize hands-on time

3. **Language Barriers**:
   - Prepare key terms in both Tetum and local dialects
   - Use visual demonstrations alongside verbal instructions
   - Encourage peer translation among students

4. **Varying Skill Levels**:
   - Pair more experienced students with beginners
   - Provide additional support to those who need it during practical activities
   - Offer extra challenges for advanced students

5. **Weather Considerations**:
   - Have a backup plan for indoor activities in case of rain
   - Schedule harvesting activities during the cooler parts of the day
   - Ensure plenty of water is available to keep students hydrated

6. **Cultural Sensitivity**:
   - Discuss and incorporate traditional honey harvesting methods
   - Be respectful of local customs regarding bees and honey
   - Invite local elders or experienced beekeepers to share their knowledge
