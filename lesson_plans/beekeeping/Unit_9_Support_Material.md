## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with financial concepts.
   - **Solution**: Use relatable examples and visual aids. Start with simple calculations before moving to more complex analyses.

   - **Solution**: Encourage students to conduct informal market research in their communities. Provide regional data as a starting point.

3. **Challenge**: Students may lack confidence in their marketing abilities.
   - **Solution**: Emphasize that marketing is about storytelling and connecting with people. Use role-playing exercises to build confidence.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in estimating costs and revenues.
   - **Solution**: Provide realistic ranges based on local conditions. Teach students to make conservative estimates and adjust as they gain experience.

5. **Challenge**: Limited access to packaging materials or design tools.
   - **Solution**: Focus on simple, locally-available packaging options. Encourage creativity with natural materials. Demonstrate hand-drawn label designs.

6. **Challenge**: Varying literacy levels among students.
   - **Solution**: Use visual aids and hands-on activities. Pair students of different literacy levels for group work. Provide oral explanations alongside written materials.
