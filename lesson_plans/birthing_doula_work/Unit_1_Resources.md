## Excerpts and Short Stories

### The Story of Maria's Birth

Maria was expecting her first child in a small village outside Dili. As her due date approached, her mother and aunts gathered to prepare traditional herbs and foods believed to ease labor. The village daya, Sra. Ana, visited regularly to check on Maria and offer advice.

When labor began, Maria's female relatives surrounded her with encouragement and comfort. Sra. Ana guided Maria through traditional positions and breathing techniques. As the birth neared, the women sang softly, welcoming the new life.

After the baby was born, Sra. Ana helped with the first breastfeeding while Maria's mother prepared a warm ginger drink to restore her strength. The placenta was carefully buried beneath a young fruit tree, symbolizing new life and future abundance for the family.

This story illustrates the communal and traditional aspects of childbirth in Timor-Leste, highlighting the role of family support, traditional birth attendants, and cultural practices.
