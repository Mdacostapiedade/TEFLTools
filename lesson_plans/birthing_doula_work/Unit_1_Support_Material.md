## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have varying levels of familiarity with traditional practices.
   **Solution**: Encourage peer teaching and sharing of experiences. Create mixed groups to ensure knowledge exchange.

2. **Challenge**: Resistance to modern doula practices that seem to conflict with traditional methods.
   **Solution**: Emphasize the complementary nature of doula support and traditional practices. Provide examples of successful integration.

3. **Challenge**: Limited literacy or academic background of some students.
   **Solution**: Use more visual aids, hands-on activities, and oral discussions. Provide audio recordings of key information.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in role-playing or public speaking activities.
   **Solution**: Start with pair work before moving to larger group presentations. Provide clear scripts and templates for practice.

5. **Challenge**: Limited access to technology for presentations or online resources.
   **Solution**: Prepare printed handouts and use low-tech alternatives like flipcharts. Create resource packs with printed materials from online sources.

6. **Challenge**: Varying dialects or language proficiency among students.
   **Solution**: Use simple language, provide visual aids, and encourage peer translation. Ensure key terms are explained in multiple local languages if necessary.
