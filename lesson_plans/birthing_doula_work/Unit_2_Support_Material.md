3. **Limited Resources**:
   - Focus on low-cost, locally available solutions for nutrition and comfort measures
   - Teach improvisation skills for using common household items as teaching aids
   - Emphasize hands-on practice and role-playing to compensate for lack of equipment

4. **Varying Education Levels**:
   - Use a mix of teaching methods to accommodate different learning styles
   - Pair stronger students with those who need more support during group activities
   - Provide additional explanations or simplified versions of complex concepts as needed

5. **Addressing Misconceptions**:
   - Create a safe, non-judgmental environment for discussing beliefs and practices
   - Use evidence-based information to gently correct misconceptions
   - Highlight the reasons behind recommended practices to encourage understanding and adoption

6. **Engaging Participants**:
