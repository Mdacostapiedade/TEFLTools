# Lesson Plan: Labor and Birth Process

## Resources Needed
- Whiteboard and markers
- Laptop and projector for video playback
- Doll and pelvis model
- Handouts on stages of labor
- Birth videos (natural births)
- Flip chart paper and markers for group work

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Describe the physiological process of labor and birth
2. Identify and explain the stages of labor
3. Recognize common interventions and their indications during labor

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Ask students to share any personal experiences or stories they've heard about labor and birth
- Discuss common perceptions and misconceptions about the labor process

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)
Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Contractions
- Effacement
- Dilation
- Transition
- Pushing stage
- Placenta delivery

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)
1. Signs of labor (10 minutes)
   - Discuss early signs of labor
   - Explain the difference between false labor and true labor

2. Stages of labor (20 minutes)
   - First stage: Early labor, active labor, transition
   - Second stage: Pushing and birth
   - Third stage: Delivery of placenta

3. Physiological changes during labor (15 minutes)
   - Hormonal changes
   - Physical changes in the body
   - Emotional changes

## Practice Activities (40 minutes)
1. Video analysis (20 minutes)
   - Watch short clips of natural births
   - In small groups, identify and discuss the stages of labor observed

2. Fetal positions demonstration (20 minutes)
   - Using the doll and pelvis model, demonstrate various fetal positions
   - Have students practice identifying positions and discussing their implications for labor

## Production Tasks (30 minutes)
1. Role-play activity (15 minutes)
   - In pairs, have students take turns being the doula and the laboring woman
   - Practice explaining the stages of labor and offering support

2. Create a visual aid (15 minutes)
   - In small groups, create a simple diagram or chart illustrating the stages of labor
   - Present to the class

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Conduct a brief quiz on the stages of labor and physiological changes
- Address any remaining questions or concerns

## Homework Assignment
1. Read handout on common labor interventions
2. Write a short reflection (1-2 paragraphs) on how understanding the labor process can help a doula provide better support

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
1. Contractions: Rhythmic tightening of the uterus that helps dilate the cervix and move the baby down the birth canal
2. Effacement: The thinning and softening of the cervix during labor
3. Dilation: The opening of the cervix, measured in centimeters from 0 to 10
4. Transition: The most intense part of labor, typically occurring at the end of the first stage
5. Pushing stage: The second stage of labor when the mother actively pushes to birth the baby
6. Placenta delivery: The third stage of labor when the placenta is expelled from the uterus
