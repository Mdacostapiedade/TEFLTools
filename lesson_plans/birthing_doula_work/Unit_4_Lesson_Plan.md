## Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Create a "doula bag" list
   Students work in small groups to create a list of items they would include in their doula bag for providing comfort measures.

2. Develop a quick reference guide
   Individually, students create a one-page quick reference guide for labor support techniques.

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Group discussion: What techniques did students find most effective or interesting?
- Quick quiz: Match comfort measures to their benefits or appropriate use in labor.

## Homework Assignment

1. Practice three comfort measures with a friend or family member and write a reflection on the experience.
2. Research and write a short report on one traditional Timorese comfort measure used during labor.

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Counterpressure: Applying firm, steady pressure to a specific area of the body to relieve pain during contractions.
- Endorphins: Natural pain-relieving hormones produced by the body during labor.
- Gate control theory: The idea that non-painful input can close the "gates" to painful input, reducing pain sensation.
- Active labor: The phase of labor characterized by regular, strong contractions and cervical dilation from 6-10 cm.
- Transition: The most intense phase of labor, typically occurring as the cervix dilates from 8-10 cm.
