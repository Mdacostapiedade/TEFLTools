# Lesson Plan: Immediate Postpartum and Breastfeeding

## 1. Resources Needed

- Handouts on physiological changes after birth
- Breastfeeding demonstration aids (dolls, breast models)
- Posters or images of proper latch and positioning
- Handouts on traditional Timorese postpartum practices
- Flip chart and markers
- Projector and screen (if available)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe the main physiological changes that occur in the immediate postpartum period
- Demonstrate proper latch and positioning for breastfeeding
- Explain the importance of early initiation of breastfeeding
- Discuss traditional Timorese postpartum practices and how they can be integrated with evidence-based care

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Ask students to share any personal experiences or observations they have had with the immediate postpartum period or breastfeeding initiation. Encourage them to discuss both positive and challenging aspects they've witnessed or experienced.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Lochia
- Afterpains
- Colostrum
- Let-down reflex
- Latch
- Rooting reflex

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### a. Physiological Changes After Birth (15 minutes)
- Uterine involution
- Lochia and bleeding patterns
- Hormonal shifts
- Physical recovery

### b. Initiation of Breastfeeding (15 minutes)
- Importance of early initiation
- Colostrum and its benefits
- Signs of readiness in newborns
- Proper latch and positioning

### c. Traditional Postpartum Practices in Timor-Leste (10 minutes)
- Overview of common practices
- Cultural significance
- Potential benefits and considerations

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### a. Breastfeeding Demonstration (15 minutes)
Demonstrate proper latch and positioning using dolls and breast models. Have students practice in pairs, taking turns being the "mother" and the "doula."

### b. Case Study Discussion (15 minutes)
Present a case study of a new mother in Timor-Leste experiencing challenges with breastfeeding. In small groups, have students discuss how they would support this mother, incorporating both evidence-based practices and culturally sensitive approaches.

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

### a. Role-play (15 minutes)
In pairs, have students role-play a scenario where a doula is supporting a new mother with her first breastfeeding session. Observe and provide feedback.

### b. Integration Discussion (15 minutes)
As a class, brainstorm and discuss ways to integrate traditional Timorese postpartum practices with evidence-based care. Create a list of recommendations on the flip chart.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

Summarize the key points of the lesson, addressing any questions or concerns that arose during the activities. Highlight the importance of respecting cultural practices while promoting best practices for postpartum and breastfeeding support.

## 9. Homework Assignment

Ask students to:
1. Interview an elder in their community about traditional postpartum practices.
2. Write a short reflection (1-2 pages) on how they might incorporate these practices into their doula work while ensuring evidence-based care.
3. Review the handout on physiological changes after birth and come prepared with any questions for the next class.

- Lochia: Vaginal discharge after giving birth, consisting of blood, mucus, and uterine tissue
- Afterpains: Contractions of the uterus after childbirth, often experienced during breastfeeding
- Colostrum: The first form of milk produced by the mammary glands, rich in antibodies and nutrients
- Let-down reflex: The release of milk from the alveoli through the breast ducts to the nipples
- Latch: The way a baby attaches to the breast for feeding
- Rooting reflex: A newborn's natural reflex to turn their head towards touch on their cheek, searching for the nipple
