5. Local Timorese health department resources on maternal and newborn care (provide specific links or documents if available)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barriers**: Ensure all materials are translated into local languages. Use visual aids and demonstrations to overcome language differences.

2. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Be prepared to discuss how evidence-based practices can coexist with traditional beliefs. Encourage open dialogue and avoid dismissing cultural practices outright.

3. **Limited Resources**: If breast models or dolls are unavailable, consider using balloons or simple drawings for demonstrations. Encourage students to practice positioning with each other.

4. **Varied Literacy Levels**: Use a mix of verbal instruction, visual aids, and hands-on practice to accommodate different learning styles and literacy levels.

5. **Personal Discomfort**: Some students may feel uncomfortable discussing or demonstrating breastfeeding. Create a respectful environment and offer alternative ways to participate, such as describing actions verbally.

6. **Misinformation**: Be prepared to address common myths about breastfeeding and postpartum care. Provide clear, evidence-based information while respecting local knowledge.

7. **Limited Healthcare Access**: Discuss strategies for supporting mothers in areas with limited access to healthcare, emphasizing the importance of recognizing when to seek medical help.

8. **Practical Experience**: If observing real breastfeeding sessions is challenging, consider inviting experienced mothers to class to share their experiences and demonstrate positioning with dolls.
