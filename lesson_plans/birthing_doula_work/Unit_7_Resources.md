# Lecture Notes

## Active Listening and Empathetic Communication

### What is Active Listening?
- Fully concentrating on what is being said
- Not just hearing the words, but understanding the complete message
- Involves both verbal and non-verbal cues

### Key Components of Active Listening:
1. Paying attention
   - Give the speaker your undivided attention
   - Put aside distracting thoughts
   - Avoid being distracted by environmental factors
2. Showing that you're listening
   - Use your body language and gestures to show you are engaged
   - Nod occasionally, smile and use other facial expressions
   - Encourage the speaker to continue with small verbal comments like "yes" or "uh huh"
3. Providing feedback
   - Reflect on what has been said by paraphrasing
   - Ask questions to clarify certain points
   - Summarize the speaker's comments periodically
4. Deferring judgment
   - Allow the speaker to finish each point before asking questions
   - Don't interrupt with counter arguments
5. Responding Appropriately
   - Be candid, open, and honest in your response
   - Assert your opinions respectfully
   - Treat the other person as you would want to be treated

### Empathy in Doula Work
- Definition: The ability to understand and share the feelings of another
- Importance in doula work:
  * Builds trust with clients
  * Helps clients feel heard and supported
  * Enables doulas to provide more effective emotional support

### Demonstrating Empathy:
1. Listen without judgment
2. Acknowledge emotions
3. Validate feelings
4. Show genuine concern
5. Offer support

### Examples of Empathetic Responses:
- "It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. That's completely understandable."
- "I can see how that situation would be frustrating for you."
- "It's okay to feel anxious. Many women experience similar feelings during pregnancy."

## Bridging Communication

### The Doula's Role in Communication
- Act as a liaison between clients and healthcare providers
- Facilitate clear understanding on both sides
- Advocate for the client's needs and preferences

### Common Communication Barriers in Timorese Healthcare Settings
1. Language differences
2. Cultural misunderstandings
3. Power dynamics between providers and patients
4. Limited health literacy
5. Fear or mistrust of medical systems

### Strategies for Overcoming Communication Barriers
1. Use simple, clear language
2. Employ visual aids when possible
3. Encourage clients to ask questions
4. Clarify medical terms and procedures
5. Respect cultural beliefs while providing evidence-based information
6. Foster a collaborative relationship with healthcare providers

## Informed Consent and Decision-Making Support

### Understanding Informed Consent
- Definition: Permission granted by a patient to a doctor for treatment with full knowledge of the possible risks and benefits
- Key elements:
  1. Disclosure of relevant information
  2. Capacity to understand and make a decision
  3. Voluntariness (freedom from coercion)

### The Doula's Role in Supporting Decision-Making
- Provide unbiased information
- Encourage clients to ask questions
- Help clients understand their options
- Support the client's right to make informed choices
- Respect the final decision of the client

### Balancing Advocacy and Respect for Medical Expertise
- Recognize the limits of doula knowledge and scope of practice
- Encourage open communication between clients and healthcare providers
- Support client preferences while acknowledging medical recommendations
- Know when to step back and allow direct client-provider communication

# Discussion Questions

5. How can a doula support informed decision-making without overstepping their role or undermining medical advice?
6. What are some ways to respectfully communicate a client's cultural practices or beliefs to healthcare providers who may be unfamiliar with them?
7. How might a doula's communication style need to adapt when supporting clients from different regions or ethnic groups within Timor-Leste?
8. What strategies can be used to explain complex medical procedures or interventions to clients with limited health literacy?
9. How can a doula maintain professional boundaries while still providing empathetic support to clients?
10. What are some effective ways to advocate for a client's birth preferences in a hospital setting that may have different standard practices?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Exercise 1: Empathetic Response Practice

Write three different empathetic responses for each of the following client statements:

1. "I'm scared about giving birth. What if something goes wrong?"
2. "My mother-in-law keeps telling me what to do during my pregnancy, and it's stressing me out."
3. "The doctor wants me to have a C-section, but I really wanted a natural birth."

For each response, focus on:
- Acknowledging the client's feelings
- Validating their concerns
- Offering support without judgment

## Exercise 2: Birth Preferences Translation

Create a short birth preferences statement (5-7 points) for a hypothetical Timorese client. Then, "translate" this statement into language that would be clear and respectful when communicating with healthcare providers. Focus on:

- Using culturally appropriate language
- Balancing client preferences with medical considerations
- Presenting requests in a collaborative manner

## Exercise 3: Reflective Journal Entry

Write a 500-word reflective journal entry on a time when you experienced a communication challenge in a healthcare setting (either as a patient or a support person). Address the following points:

- Describe the situation and the communication challenge
- Explain how the challenge affected the care received or given
- Discuss what could have been done differently to improve communication
- Reflect on how this experience informs your approach as a doula

# Assignment Details

## Communication Toolkit Development

Create a personal "communication toolkit" with at least five strategies for effective communication and advocacy in your doula practice. For each strategy:

1. Provide a name or brief description of the strategy
2. Explain how to implement the strategy
3. Give an example of a situation where this strategy would be useful
4. Discuss any potential challenges or considerations when using this strategy

Your toolkit should be tailored to the Timorese context and consider cultural, linguistic, and healthcare system factors.

## Birth Preferences Template Creation

Develop a culturally appropriate birth preferences template for use with clients in Timor-Leste. Your template should:

1. Be written in simple, clear language (consider providing versions in Tetum and Portuguese)
2. Include space for personal information and important medical history
3. Cover key aspects of labor and delivery preferences
4. Address common interventions and options available in Timorese healthcare settings
5. Include space for cultural or personal preferences specific to Timorese traditions
6. Be designed in a format that is easy for both clients and healthcare providers to read and understand

Provide a brief (250-300 word) explanation of your design choices and how they reflect the needs of Timorese clients and healthcare providers.
