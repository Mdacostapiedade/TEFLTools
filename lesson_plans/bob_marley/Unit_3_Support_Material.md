## 5. Tips for Teachers

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to connect Marley's themes to Timorese context.
   **Solution**: Provide specific examples of current social issues in Timor-Leste before the production task. Consider inviting a local activist or social worker to speak briefly to the class.

2. **Challenge**: Some students might be uncomfortable performing spoken word.
   **Solution**: Offer alternatives such as writing a short essay or creating a visual representation of their chosen issue.

3. **Challenge**: Language barriers in understanding Marley's Jamaican Patois.
   **Solution**: Provide translations or explanations of key phrases. Use this as an opportunity to discuss language evolution and cultural expression.

4. **Challenge**: Limited access to audio equipment or internet for music playback.
   **Solution**: Prepare printed lyrics and be ready to perform or recite parts of the songs yourself if necessary.

5. **Challenge**: Varying levels of musical knowledge among students.
   **Solution**: Focus on the lyrical content and message rather than musical technicalities. Encourage students to express themselves in ways they're comfortable with.
