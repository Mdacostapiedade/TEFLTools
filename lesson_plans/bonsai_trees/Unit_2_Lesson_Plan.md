# Lesson Plan: Bonsai Styles and Aesthetics

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer for displaying images
- Handouts with diagrams of classical bonsai styles
- Sketching paper and pencils for each student
- Examples of bonsai trees (if available) or high-quality photographs

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify and describe at least 5 classical bonsai styles
- Explain the key aesthetic principles in bonsai design
- Apply bonsai style concepts to local Timorese tree species

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display images of various tree shapes found in nature
- Ask students to describe the shapes and forms they observe
- Discuss how natural forces (wind, light, terrain) influence tree growth

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Formal upright (Chokkan)
- Informal upright (Moyogi)
- Slanting (Shakan)
- Cascade (Kengai)
- Semi-cascade (Han-kengai)
- Proportion
- Balance
- Asymmetry

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Classical Bonsai Styles
- Explain and show examples of each classical style:
  * Formal upright
  * Informal upright
  * Slanting
  * Cascade
  * Semi-cascade
  * Literati (Bunjin-gi)
  * Group planting (Yose-ue)

### Aesthetic Principles in Bonsai Design
- Discuss the importance of:
  * Proportion: relationship between trunk, branches, and pot
  * Balance: visual stability without symmetry
  * Asymmetry: creating interest and naturalistic appearance
  * Line: flow and movement in the overall design
  * Negative space: importance of empty areas in the composition

### Adapting Styles to Timorese Species
- Show examples of local tree species
- Discuss how their natural growth habits can be adapted to bonsai styles

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Assign each group a different bonsai style
- Have groups identify key characteristics of their assigned style
- Groups present their findings to the class

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

- Students individually sketch a bonsai design using a local Timorese tree species
- Incorporate at least one classical style and demonstrate understanding of aesthetic principles
- Students share their sketches with a partner and explain their design choices

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the main bonsai styles covered
- Review key aesthetic principles
- Class discussion: How can bonsai styles reflect Timorese cultural elements?

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a one-page report on a Timorese tree species that would be suitable for bonsai
- Include information on its natural growth habit and suggest which bonsai style(s) would be appropriate for this species

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Formal upright (Chokkan): Straight, upright trunk with symmetrical branching
- Informal upright (Moyogi): Trunk has curves but apex is over the base
- Slanting (Shakan): Trunk is straight but grows at an angle
- Cascade (Kengai): Trunk and foliage extend below the base of the pot
- Semi-cascade (Han-kengai): Trunk extends horizontally before dropping below the pot rim
- Proportion: The relative size and scale of different parts of the bonsai
- Balance: Visual equilibrium in the overall design
- Asymmetry: Lack of symmetry, creating a more natural and interesting appearance
