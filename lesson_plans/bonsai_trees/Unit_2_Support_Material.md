# Support Material for Bonsai Styles and Aesthetics Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Formal upright (Chokkan)**: A style where the trunk is straight and vertical, with symmetrical branching.
- **Informal upright (Moyogi)**: A style where the trunk has curves but the apex is still over the base.
- **Slanting (Shakan)**: A style where the trunk grows at an angle but is mostly straight.
- **Cascade (Kengai)**: A style where the trunk and foliage extend below the base of the pot.
- **Semi-cascade (Han-kengai)**: A style where the trunk extends horizontally before dropping below the pot rim.
- **Literati (Bunjin-gi)**: A style characterized by a thin, elegant trunk with minimal branching.
- **Group planting (Yose-ue)**: Multiple trees planted together to create a forest or grove effect.
- **Proportion**: The relative size and scale of different parts of the bonsai.
- **Balance**: Visual equilibrium in the overall design of the bonsai.
- **Asymmetry**: Lack of symmetry, creating a more natural and interesting appearance.
- **Line**: The visual flow and movement in the overall design of the bonsai.
- **Negative space**: The empty areas in the composition that contribute to the overall design.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Bonsai Styles Diagram**: A visual representation of the seven classical bonsai styles mentioned in the lesson. Each style should be illustrated with a simple line drawing showing the characteristic trunk and branch structure.

2. **Aesthetic Principles Illustration**: A series of before-and-after sketches demonstrating the application of aesthetic principles:
   - Proportion: Show a tree with poor proportion next to one with good proportion.
   - Balance: Illustrate balanced and unbalanced designs side by side.
   - Asymmetry: Compare symmetrical and asymmetrical designs.
   - Line: Highlight the flow of branches in a well-designed bonsai.
   - Negative space: Show how empty spaces contribute to the overall composition.

3. **Timorese Tree Adaptations**: Sketches of common Timorese tree species, with annotations showing how their natural forms can be adapted to various bonsai styles.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Bonsai Style Identification Worksheet**: 
   - Content: Images of various bonsai trees.
   - Task: Students identify the style of each tree and list key characteristics.

2. **Aesthetic Principles Application Sheet**:
   - Content: Outline drawings of unstyled trees.
   - Task: Students sketch how they would style the tree, applying learned aesthetic principles.

3. **Timorese Species Bonsai Potential Guide**:
   - Content: List of local Timorese tree species with their characteristics.
   - Task: Students suggest suitable bonsai styles for each species and explain their reasoning.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "The Art of Bonsai: Creation, Care and Enjoyment" by Yuji Yoshimura and Giovanna M. Halford
2. "Bonsai Techniques II" by John Yoshio Naka
3. Online resource: Bonsai Empire (www.bonsaiempire.com) for tutorials and species guides
4. Local botanical gardens or arboretums for observing natural tree forms
5. Bonsai forums specific to tropical species, such as the Tropical Bonsai Forum (www.tropicalbonsai.com)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to visualize bonsai styles.
   **Solution**: Use physical examples or high-quality photographs. Encourage students to sketch styles to improve understanding.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in applying aesthetic principles to local species.
   **Solution**: Provide examples of how traditional bonsai styles have been adapted for tropical species. Encourage creative thinking about how local trees grow naturally.

3. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by the number of styles and principles.
   **Solution**: Focus on a few key styles and principles initially. Build complexity gradually over multiple lessons.

4. **Challenge**: Lack of physical bonsai examples.
   **Solution**: Use a combination of photos, videos, and if possible, arrange a field trip to a local garden or nursery.

5. **Challenge**: Connecting bonsai aesthetics to Timorese culture.
   **Solution**: Facilitate discussions on how bonsai principles might align with or differ from traditional Timorese art forms. Encourage students to think about how bonsai could represent Timorese landscapes or cultural symbols.
