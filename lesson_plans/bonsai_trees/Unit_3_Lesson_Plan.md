2. Explain the process of responsibly collecting yamadori
3. Demonstrate proper techniques for selecting and preparing nursery stock for bonsai
4. Pot a collected or nursery-bought tree as a pre-bonsai specimen

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

1. Display images of various Timorese trees in their natural habitat
2. Ask students to discuss in pairs which characteristics make these trees potentially good for bonsai
3. Have pairs share their observations with the class

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)

Write and explain the following terms on the whiteboard:
- Yamadori
- Nebari
- Taper
- Rootball
- Pre-bonsai

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Native Timorese Species for Bonsai (10 minutes)
   - Present a slideshow of suitable native species
   - Discuss their characteristics and bonsai potential

2. Responsible Yamadori Collection (10 minutes)
   - Explain ethical and legal considerations
   - Demonstrate proper collection techniques
   - Discuss aftercare for collected trees

3. Nursery Stock Selection (10 minutes)
   - Show examples of good nursery stock for bonsai
   - Explain what to look for: trunk taper, root spread, branch placement

## Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Species Identification Game (15 minutes)
   - Divide class into teams
   - Show images of Timorese trees, have teams identify and explain bonsai potential

2. Nursery Stock Evaluation (15 minutes)
   - Provide students with several nursery plants
   - Have them evaluate and rank the plants for bonsai potential, explaining their choices

3. Yamadori Collection Role-play (15 minutes)

   - Classmates provide feedback on technique and ethical considerations

## Production Task (45 minutes)

Hands-on Workshop: Collecting and Potting
1. Demonstrate the process of preparing a collected or nursery tree for potting
2. Guide students through the process of potting their own pre-bonsai specimen
3. Ensure proper aftercare instructions are provided

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

1. Quick quiz: Students match Timorese tree species to their bonsai characteristics
2. Open discussion: Challenges faced during the potting process and how to overcome them

## Homework Assignment

1. Create a detailed guide for one native Timorese tree species suitable for bonsai, including:
   - Botanical name and common name
   - Natural habitat and growth characteristics
   - Bonsai potential and styling suggestions
   - Basic care requirements

2. Research and document two locations in Timor-Leste where yamadori could potentially be collected, noting any legal or environmental considerations
