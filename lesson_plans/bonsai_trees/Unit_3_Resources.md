## Native Timorese Species for Bonsai

### Introduction
- Importance of using native species for bonsai in Timor-Leste
- Benefits: adaptation to local climate, cultural significance, conservation

### Key Species

1. Sandalwood (Santalum album)
   - Characteristics: Fragrant wood, small leaves, naturally compact growth
   - Bonsai potential: Excellent for shohin and mame styles
   - Cultural significance: Historically important export, spiritual uses

2. Eucalyptus urophylla
   - Characteristics: Fast-growing, adaptable, interesting bark
   - Bonsai potential: Good for larger bonsai, informal upright styles
   - Note: Requires frequent pruning to maintain shape

3. Casuarina equisetifolia (Beach she-oak)
   - Characteristics: Fine, needle-like foliage, naturally wind-swept appearance
   - Bonsai potential: Excellent for literati and windswept styles
   - Ecological importance: Used in coastal reforestation

4. Schleichera oleosa (Kusambi)
   - Characteristics: Compound leaves, interesting trunk formation
   - Bonsai potential: Good for medium to large bonsai, informal styles
   - Cultural use: Seeds used in traditional medicine

5. Alstonia scholaris (Devil tree)
   - Characteristics: Glossy leaves, interesting branch structure
   - Bonsai potential: Suitable for formal upright and multi-trunk styles
   - Medicinal uses: Bark used in traditional remedies

### Considerations for Bonsai Cultivation
- Adaptations to Timor-Leste's climate (dry and wet seasons)
- Growth rates and pruning requirements
- Pot size and soil mix adjustments for local species

## Responsible Yamadori Collection

### Ethical Considerations
- Respect for nature and ecosystems
- Legal aspects: permits and protected areas
- Sustainable practices: take only what's needed, leave no trace

### Collection Techniques
1. Site selection
   - Look for naturally stunted trees in harsh environments
   - Avoid protected or ecologically sensitive areas

2. Tree selection criteria
   - Age indicators: bark texture, trunk taper
   - Potential for bonsai styling: trunk movement, branch placement
   - Health and vigor assessment

3. Extraction process
   - Proper tools: spade, saw, root pruners
   - Timing: best during dormant season or just before growth period
   - Root ball preservation techniques

4. Aftercare
   - Immediate protection from sun and wind
   - Watering and misting regimen
   - Temporary potting and recovery period

### Legal and Conservation Aspects
- Obtaining necessary permits
- Working with local environmental agencies
- Contributing to reforestation efforts

## Nursery Stock Selection and Preparation

### Selecting Nursery Stock
1. Trunk characteristics
   - Look for good taper and movement
   - Assess bark quality and texture

2. Root system
   - Check for a well-developed nebari (surface roots)
   - Avoid trees with severe girdling roots

3. Branch structure
   - Evaluate placement and distribution
   - Look for low branches that can form the primary structure

4. Overall health
   - Check for signs of pests or diseases
   - Assess leaf color and vigor

### Preparing Nursery Stock for Bonsai
1. Initial pruning
   - Remove excess branches to reveal tree structure
   - Prune roots to fit bonsai container

2. Wiring basics
   - When to wire nursery stock
   - Proper wire size and application techniques

3. Repotting
   - Choosing the right pot size and style
   - Proper soil mix for the species and climate

4. Aftercare
   - Watering and fertilization schedule
   - Protection from extreme weather during establishment

# Discussion Questions

1. How does using native Timorese species for bonsai contribute to cultural preservation and environmental awareness?

2. What ethical considerations should be taken into account when collecting yamadori, and how can collectors ensure they're practicing sustainable collection?

3. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of using yamadori versus nursery stock for bonsai. Which do you think is more suitable for beginners?

4. How might climate change affect the availability and suitability of certain native species for bonsai in Timor-Leste?

5. Discuss the potential economic impact of developing a bonsai culture in Timor-Leste. How might it benefit local communities?

6. What challenges might you face when adapting traditional bonsai techniques to Timorese species, and how would you overcome them?

7. How can the practice of bonsai be integrated with conservation efforts in Timor-Leste?

8. Discuss the importance of understanding a tree's natural habitat when selecting and caring for it as a bonsai specimen.
