## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may be overzealous in collecting yamadori.
   - **Solution**: Emphasize the importance of conservation and only collect with proper permissions. Organize supervised collection trips.

2. **Challenge**: Limited availability of suitable native species.
   - **Solution**: Partner with local nurseries or forestry departments to source appropriate plant material. Encourage propagation of native species.

3. **Challenge**: Students struggling to visualize potential in raw material.
   - **Solution**: Provide before-and-after examples of styled trees. Use virtual design software to demonstrate potential outcomes.

4. **Challenge**: Varying skill levels among students during hands-on activities.
   - **Solution**: Implement a buddy system pairing more experienced students with beginners. Provide additional one-on-one guidance as needed.

5. **Challenge**: Ensuring proper aftercare for collected or potted trees.
   - **Solution**: Create a class "bonsai nursery" where students can monitor and care for trees between sessions. Provide detailed aftercare guides and follow-up assignments.
