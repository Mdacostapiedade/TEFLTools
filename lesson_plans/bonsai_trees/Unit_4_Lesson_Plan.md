# Lesson Plan: Basic Bonsai Techniques

## Resources Needed
- Bonsai trees (1 per 2-3 students)
- Pruning shears
- Concave cutters
- Wire cutters
- Anodized aluminum wire (various gauges)
- Bonsai pots
- Bonsai soil mix
- Root hooks
- Chopsticks
- Watering cans
- Spray bottles

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Demonstrate proper pruning techniques for bonsai maintenance and structural shaping
2. Apply wire to branches for shaping and styling
3. Perform a basic repotting procedure, including root pruning

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
Bonsai Shape Recognition: Display images of various bonsai styles. Have students work in pairs to identify and sketch the basic structure of each tree, noting the main trunk line and primary branches.

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)
Introduce and define key terms:
- Structural pruning
- Maintenance pruning
- Wiring
- Root pruning
- Nebari

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### 1. Pruning Techniques
- Explain the difference between maintenance and structural pruning
- Demonstrate proper cutting techniques using pruning shears and concave cutters
- Show how to select branches for removal to improve tree structure

### 2. Wiring and Shaping
- Explain the purpose of wiring in bonsai
- Demonstrate proper wire application techniques
- Show how to bend and position branches using wire

### 3. Repotting and Root Pruning
- Discuss when and why repotting is necessary
- Demonstrate how to remove a tree from its pot and prune roots
- Show proper techniques for placing the tree in a new pot and adding soil

## Practice Activities (60 minutes)

### 1. Pruning Practice (20 minutes)
In pairs, students practice maintenance pruning on a bonsai tree, focusing on removing dead or crossing branches.

### 2. Wiring Exercise (20 minutes)
Students practice applying wire to branches on their bonsai, ensuring proper technique and avoiding damage to the bark.

### 3. Mock Repotting (20 minutes)
Using spare pots and soil, students practice the motions of repotting without disturbing actual bonsai roots. Focus on proper soil placement and tree positioning.

## Production Task (30 minutes)
Students work individually to create a basic styling plan for their bonsai, including sketches of desired branch placement and notes on necessary pruning and wiring.

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
- Conduct a brief Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Review the key points of pruning, wiring, and repotting
- Have students share their styling plans with a partner for feedback

## Homework Assignment
1. Research and write a one-page report on the specific care requirements for the species of bonsai they worked with in class.
2. Practice wire application on a non-bonsai plant or tree branch at home.
3. Create a maintenance schedule for their bonsai, including watering, fertilizing, and pruning tasks.

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Structural pruning: The removal of larger branches to establish the basic shape and structure of the bonsai.
- Maintenance pruning: Regular trimming to maintain the bonsai's shape and encourage fine branching.
- Wiring: The process of wrapping wire around bonsai branches to shape and position them.
- Root pruning: The selective removal of roots during repotting to control growth and maintain the tree's compact size.
- Nebari: The visible surface roots at the base of the bonsai, which contribute to the tree's overall aesthetic.
