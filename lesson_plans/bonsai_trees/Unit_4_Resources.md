## Pruning Techniques

### Maintenance Pruning
- Definition: Regular trimming to maintain the bonsai's shape and encourage fine branching
- Objectives:
  * Remove dead, diseased, or weak growth
  * Maintain the tree's silhouette
  * Encourage back-budding and ramification
- Techniques:
  * Use sharp, clean pruning shears
  * Cut at a 45-degree angle just above a node or leaf
  * Remove crossing or inward-growing branches
  * Trim new shoots back to 2-3 leaves for deciduous trees, or pinch new growth for conifers

### Structural Pruning
- Definition: The removal of larger branches to establish the basic shape and structure of the bonsai
- Objectives:
  * Create the primary branch structure
  * Establish the trunk line and taper
  * Remove branches that don't fit the desired style
- Techniques:
  * Use concave cutters for flush cuts on larger branches
  * Remove no more than 1/3 of the tree's foliage in a single pruning session
  * Consider the tree's future growth when making cuts
  * Create jin (deadwood) from removed branches when appropriate

## Wiring and Shaping

### Purpose of Wiring
- To shape and position branches that cannot be shaped by pruning alone
- To create movement and visual interest in the bonsai's structure
- To lower or raise branches to create proper spacing and pad formation

### Wiring Techniques
- Choose the appropriate wire gauge: generally 1/3 the thickness of the branch
- Types of wire: anodized aluminum (for deciduous) and annealed copper (for conifers)
- Apply wire at a 45-degree angle, wrapping smoothly and evenly
- Leave space between coils to allow for branch growth
- Extend wire to the next larger branch or the trunk for stability
- Avoid crossing or overlapping wires

### Shaping Principles
- Bend branches slowly and gradually to avoid breakage
- Create movement in three dimensions, not just side-to-side
- Lower branches should be thicker and have more horizontal movement
- Upper branches should be thinner with more upward movement
- Consider the natural growth patterns of the species when shaping

## Repotting and Root Pruning

### When to Repot
- Young, vigorously growing trees: every 1-2 years
- Mature trees: every 2-5 years, depending on species and pot size
- Signs that repotting is needed:
  * Water drains slowly or poorly
  * Roots circling the bottom of the pot
  * Reduced vigor or yellowing leaves

### Root Pruning Techniques
- Remove the tree from its pot carefully
- Gently comb out the roots with a root hook
- Trim back long roots, aiming to remove no more than 1/3 of the root mass
- Cut roots cleanly with sharp scissors or pruning shears
- Pay special attention to the nebari (surface roots) for aesthetic purposes

### Repotting Process
- Choose an appropriate pot: slightly larger than the root mass
- Cover drainage holes with mesh to retain soil
- Add a layer of coarse drainage material at the bottom of the pot
- Position the tree, considering front view and angle
- Add bonsai soil mix, working it in among the roots with chopsticks
- Water thoroughly after repotting
- Protect the tree from strong winds and direct sunlight for a few weeks after repotting

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the balance between maintenance pruning and structural pruning change as a bonsai matures?
2. What are the potential risks of over-pruning, and how can they be mitigated?
3. How might wiring techniques need to be adapted for different tree species or styles of bonsai?
4. Discuss the ethical considerations of heavy pruning and wiring in bonsai cultivation. How do we balance artistic expression with the tree's health?
5. How does the climate in Timor-Leste affect repotting schedules and techniques compared to traditional bonsai practices in Japan or China?
6. What role does patience play in bonsai cultivation, particularly when it comes to shaping and styling techniques?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Bonsai Styling Plan

1. Choose a specific tree species native to Timor-Leste that is suitable for bonsai.
2. Research the natural growth habits and characteristics of this species.
3. Create a detailed styling plan for a hypothetical bonsai of this species, including:
   - A sketch of the desired final form
   - Notes on necessary structural pruning
   - A wiring diagram showing which branches will be wired and in what direction
   - A timeline for development, including when to perform certain techniques
4. Write a 500-word explanation of your styling choices, addressing:
   - How the plan reflects the natural growth habits of the species
   - How you've incorporated elements of traditional bonsai styles
   - Any unique challenges or considerations for this species in bonsai form

# Assignment Details

## Bonsai Maintenance Journal

1. Over the next month, keep a detailed journal of your bonsai's care and development.
2. Record the following information daily:
   - Watering schedule and amount
   - Sunlight exposure
   - Any pruning or pinching performed
   - Observations of new growth or changes in the tree's appearance
3. Weekly, perform and document the following tasks:
   - Take photographs of the bonsai from multiple angles
   - Measure and record the length of new shoots
   - Note any signs of stress or disease
   - Reflect on the tree's progress and any adjustments needed to your care routine
4. At the end of the month, write a 2-page report summarizing:
   - The overall health and development of your bonsai
   - Challenges you encountered and how you addressed them
   - Lessons learned about bonsai care specific to your tree's species and the local climate
   - Your plans for the bonsai's future development

## Local Species Guide

### Casuarina equisetifolia (Coastal She-oak)
- Characteristics: Fine, needle-like foliage, naturally windswept appearance
- Bonsai potential: Excellent for literati (bunjin) style, tolerant of pruning and wiring

### Schleichera oleosa (Kusambi)
- Characteristics: Compound leaves, develops interesting bark texture with age
- Bonsai potential: Suitable for formal and informal upright styles, develops good ramification
- Special considerations: Slow-growing, patience required for development

### Pterocarpus indicus (Narra)
- Characteristics: Pinnate leaves, develops a thick trunk and spreading canopy
- Bonsai potential: Excellent for larger bonsai, suitable for root-over-rock style
- Special considerations: Requires regular pruning to maintain compact form
