- **Structural pruning**: The removal of larger branches to establish the basic shape and structure of the bonsai.
- **Maintenance pruning**: Regular trimming to maintain the bonsai's shape and encourage fine branching.
- **Wiring**: The process of wrapping wire around bonsai branches to shape and position them.
- **Root pruning**: The selective removal of roots during repotting to control growth and maintain the tree's compact size.
- **Nebari**: The visible surface roots at the base of the bonsai, which contribute to the tree's overall aesthetic.
- **Concave cutter**: A specialized tool used to make smooth, concave cuts on branches to promote healing.
- **Bonsai soil mix**: A well-draining soil mixture specifically designed for bonsai cultivation.
- **Ramification**: The development of fine branching in a bonsai tree.
- **Jin**: A deadwood technique where a branch is stripped of bark to create the appearance of a natural snag.

2. **Proper Pruning Cuts Illustration**: A series of diagrams showing correct and incorrect pruning techniques. Includes examples of flush cuts, angled cuts, and the use of concave cutters for larger branches.

3. **Wiring Technique Flowchart**: A step-by-step visual guide to proper wire application, including wire selection, anchoring, and wrapping techniques. Includes illustrations of common mistakes to avoid.

4. **Root Pruning Diagram**: A cross-section view of a bonsai pot showing proper root pruning techniques, including which roots to remove and how to position the tree for replanting.

5. **Bonsai Tree Structure Anatomy**: A labeled diagram of a bonsai tree, identifying key parts such as the nebari, trunk line, primary branches, secondary branches, and apex.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Bonsai Maintenance Schedule Template**: A blank weekly/monthly schedule for students to fill in with tasks such as watering, fertilizing, pruning, and pest checks.

2. **Bonsai Styling Worksheet**: A template with an outline of a tree where students can sketch their planned design, including branch placement, wiring plans, and pruning notes.

3. **Species Care Guide Checklist**: A form for students to complete, detailing specific care requirements for their chosen bonsai species, including optimal light, water, and soil conditions.

4. **Wiring Practice Log**: A sheet where students can record their wiring practice, including date, species, wire gauge used, and observations on branch movement and bark health.

5. **Bonsai Health Troubleshooting Guide**: A flowchart-style guide helping students diagnose common bonsai health issues based on symptoms, with suggested remedies.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students becoming frustrated with slow progress.
   **Solution**: Emphasize that bonsai is a long-term art form. Provide examples of before-and-after photos showing bonsai development over years.

2. **Challenge**: Overenthusiastic pruning or wiring causing damage to trees.
   **Solution**: Start with more resilient species and emphasize the "less is more" approach. Provide plenty of supervised practice before independent work.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty in sourcing appropriate local species for bonsai.
   **Solution**: Collaborate with local nurseries or forestry departments to identify and propagate suitable native species. Organize field trips to collect yamadori responsibly.

4. **Challenge**: Maintaining consistent care routines, especially watering.
   **Solution**: Set up a class bonsai care roster and use reminders. Teach students to check soil moisture rather than following a strict schedule.

5. **Challenge**: Students struggling with the artistic aspects of bonsai design.
   **Solution**: Incorporate sketching exercises and provide visual references of mature bonsai. Encourage students to observe and sketch trees in nature for inspiration.

6. **Challenge**: Limited budget for tools and materials.
   **Solution**: Introduce tool-sharing systems, explore DIY alternatives for some tools, and focus on techniques that can be practiced with minimal equipment.
