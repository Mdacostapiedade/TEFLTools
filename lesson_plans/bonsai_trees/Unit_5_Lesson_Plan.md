# Lesson Plan: Advanced Shaping and Styling

## 1. Resources Needed

- Bonsai trees in various stages of development
- Deadwood carving tools (jin pliers, knob cutters, wire brushes)
- Copper and aluminum wire of various gauges
- Raffia or wire wrapping tape
- Pruning shears and concave cutters
- Lime sulfur or jin seal
- Grafting tape and sealant
- Visual aids (posters or digital slides) showing deadwood features and leaf reduction examples

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the purpose and aesthetic value of deadwood features in bonsai
- Demonstrate basic jin and shari creation techniques
- Describe and apply methods for leaf reduction
- Understand the principles of grafting and air layering in bonsai refinement

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Show images of ancient trees in nature with natural deadwood features. Ask students to discuss:
- What do these features add to the tree's appearance?
- How do they reflect the tree's age and life story?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)

Introduce and define key terms:
- Jin: deadwood technique creating the appearance of a dead branch
- Shari: deadwood technique creating the appearance of a stripped trunk
- Leaf reduction: techniques to encourage smaller leaf growth
- Grafting: joining parts from two plants so they grow as one
- Air layering: method of propagation to create new roots on a branch

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Deadwood Techniques
- Explain the aesthetic and naturalistic reasons for creating deadwood
- Demonstrate jin creation on a branch:
  1. Stripping bark
  2. Carving and shaping with tools
  3. Applying lime sulfur or jin seal
- Demonstrate shari creation on a trunk:
  1. Marking the area
  2. Carefully removing bark
  3. Carving to create texture
  4. Applying preservative

### Leaf Reduction Methods
- Discuss the importance of proportionate leaf size in bonsai
- Explain techniques:
  1. Defoliation
  2. Pruning to inner growth
  3. Root pruning
  4. Fertilizer management

### Grafting and Air Layering
- Briefly introduce grafting techniques and their uses in bonsai
- Explain air layering process and its benefits for bonsai creation

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

Divide the class into small groups. Rotate through stations:
1. Jin creation station: Practice creating jin on prepared branches
2. Shari creation station: Practice creating shari on trunk sections
3. Leaf reduction station: Examine before/after examples and practice pruning techniques
4. Air layering demonstration: Observe and assist in setting up an air layer

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

Students select a bonsai tree to work on, applying at least one technique learned today. They should plan their work, explaining their choices to a partner before beginning.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Class discussion: What challenges did you face in applying these techniques?
- Quick quiz: Match techniques to their purposes and outcomes

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a short report on a famous bonsai that incorporates deadwood features
- Practice sketching bonsai designs that include deadwood elements
- Begin a photo diary of any trees students are working on, documenting changes over time

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Jin: A bonsai technique that creates the appearance of a dead branch by stripping bark and bleaching the exposed wood
- Shari: A bonsai technique that creates the appearance of a stripped or damaged area on the trunk, mimicking natural damage
- Leaf reduction: Various techniques used to encourage the growth of smaller leaves on a bonsai tree, improving scale and proportion
- Grafting: The process of joining a part of one plant (scion) to another plant (rootstock) so they grow together
- Air layering: A propagation method where roots are encouraged to form on a branch while still attached to the parent plant, before cutting and planting the new rooted section
