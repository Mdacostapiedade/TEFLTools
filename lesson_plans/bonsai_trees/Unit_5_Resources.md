## Deadwood Techniques

### Introduction to Deadwood in Bonsai
- Deadwood features (jin and shari) add character and age to bonsai
- Mimic natural processes of weathering and decay
- Enhance the tree's story and visual interest

### Jin Creation
1. Select appropriate branch for jin
   - Consider overall design and balance
   - Choose branches that would naturally die in nature
2. Stripping bark
   - Use jin pliers to carefully remove bark
   - Work in a spiral motion from base to tip
3. Carving and shaping
   - Use knob cutters to create taper
   - Carve grooves and texture with wire brushes or carving tools
4. Applying preservative
   - Use lime sulfur or jin seal to protect and bleach wood
   - Apply in thin layers, allowing each to dry

### Shari Creation
1. Planning shari placement
   - Mark area with chalk before starting
   - Consider natural patterns of trunk damage
2. Bark removal
   - Carefully cut around marked area
   - Peel bark away from live vein
3. Wood carving
   - Create natural-looking hollows and texture
   - Use various tools to achieve desired effect
4. Preservation
   - Apply lime sulfur or wood hardener
   - Protect surrounding live bark during application

## Leaf Reduction Methods

### Importance of Leaf Size in Bonsai
- Proportionate leaves enhance the illusion of a full-sized tree in miniature
- Smaller leaves allow for finer ramification and denser foliage pads

### Defoliation
- Removing all or most leaves during growing season
- Encourages back-budding and smaller new growth
- Timing is crucial - typically early summer for deciduous trees

### Pruning to Inner Growth
- Regularly trim outer growth to force energy to inner buds
- Increases ramification over time
- Combine with directional pruning for desired branch structure

### Root Pruning
- Restricting root growth can lead to smaller leaf size
- Perform during repotting
- Balance with overall tree health

### Fertilizer Management
- Reduce nitrogen to limit leaf size
- Use balanced fertilizers during growing season
- Adjust based on species and growth stage

## Grafting and Air Layering

### Grafting in Bonsai
- Used to add branches where needed
- Can change foliage type on parts of the tree
- Types: approach, thread, and cleft grafting

### Air Layering Process
1. Select appropriate branch
2. Remove ring of bark
3. Apply rooting hormone
4. Wrap with moist sphagnum moss
5. Cover with plastic and seal
6. Monitor for root development
7. Remove and pot new tree when roots are established

### Benefits of Air Layering
- Creates new trees with mature characteristics
- Useful for reducing height of tall trunks
- Can save branches that would otherwise be removed

# Discussion Questions

1. How do deadwood features contribute to the overall aesthetic of a bonsai? Can you think of examples in nature where deadwood adds to a tree's beauty?

2. What are the ethical considerations when creating deadwood features on a living tree? How do we balance artistic expression with tree health?

3. Discuss the pros and cons of different leaf reduction techniques. Which methods might be most suitable for Timorese species?

4. How might grafting and air layering techniques be particularly useful when working with collected yamadori (wild trees)?

5. In what ways can advanced shaping techniques like deadwood creation and leaf reduction help to tell a tree's "story" more effectively?

6. How do you think these advanced techniques might be adapted or modified for use with native Timorese species? Are there any local traditional practices that might inform our approach?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Bonsai Design Narrative

Write a 500-word narrative describing the process of transforming a collected tree into a refined bonsai, incorporating at least two advanced techniques learned this week. Include your decision-making process for each technique, potential challenges, and how the techniques contribute to the tree's final design. Consider the following points:

- Initial assessment of the tree's potential
- Selection of style and primary branch placement
- Incorporation of deadwood features (jin or shari)
- Approach to leaf reduction
- Any grafting or air layering considerations
- Timeline for development
- How the chosen techniques enhance the tree's story or visual impact

# Assignment Details

## Group Bonsai Styling Project

### Objective
Work in small groups to style a collected tree over several sessions, applying advanced techniques learned in class.

### Requirements
1. Groups of 3-4 students
2. One collected tree per group (provided or approved by instructor)
3. Project duration: 3 weeks

### Process
1. Week 1: Initial design planning
   - Sketch initial design ideas
   - Decide on primary branch selection and deadwood features
   - Begin initial styling (pruning, wiring)

2. Week 2: Refinement and advanced techniques
   - Create deadwood features (jin or shari)
   - Implement leaf reduction techniques
   - Consider and plan any grafting or air layering

3. Week 3: Final touches and presentation
   - Refine design elements
   - Prepare display (pot selection, accent plants)
   - Write project summary and reflection

### Deliverables
1. Styled bonsai tree
2. Before and after photos documenting the process
3. Written report including:
   - Initial design concept and rationale
   - Techniques used and justification
   - Challenges encountered and solutions
   - Future development plan for the tree
4. Group presentation to the class (10 minutes per group)

### Evaluation Criteria
- Application of advanced techniques
- Aesthetic quality of the final design
- Thoughtfulness of the design process
- Quality of documentation and presentation
- Teamwork and collaboration
