# Support Material for Advanced Shaping and Styling Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Jin**: A bonsai technique that creates the appearance of a dead branch by stripping bark and bleaching the exposed wood.
- **Shari**: A bonsai technique that creates the appearance of a stripped or damaged area on the trunk, mimicking natural damage.
- **Deadwood**: Intentionally created or naturally occurring dead areas on a bonsai tree, used to add character and age.
- **Leaf reduction**: Various techniques used to encourage the growth of smaller leaves on a bonsai tree, improving scale and proportion.
- **Defoliation**: The complete or partial removal of leaves to encourage new, smaller growth.
- **Grafting**: The process of joining a part of one plant (scion) to another plant (rootstock) so they grow together.
- **Air layering**: A propagation method where roots are encouraged to form on a branch while still attached to the parent plant, before cutting and planting the new rooted section.
- **Lime sulfur**: A solution used to bleach and preserve deadwood on bonsai trees.
- **Raffia**: Natural fiber used to protect branches when bending or wiring.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Deadwood Feature Diagram**: A labeled illustration showing different types of deadwood features on a bonsai tree, including jin, shari, and uro (hollows).

2. **Leaf Reduction Comparison Chart**: A side-by-side comparison of leaves before and after various leaf reduction techniques, showing the size difference.

3. **Jin Creation Process**: A step-by-step visual guide showing the process of creating jin, from selecting the branch to applying lime sulfur.

4. **Air Layering Illustration**: A cross-section diagram of a branch undergoing air layering, showing the cut, applied rooting hormone, and wrapped area.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Deadwood Planning Worksheet**: A template for students to sketch their bonsai and plan where to add deadwood features, with spaces to note the techniques they'll use and reasons for their choices.

2. **Leaf Reduction Tracking Sheet**: A chart for students to record leaf measurements before and after applying reduction techniques, with space for observations over time.

3. **Grafting and Air Layering Decision Tree**: A flowchart to help students decide when to use grafting or air layering techniques based on the tree's needs and characteristics.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "The Art of Creating Bonsai Deadwood" by Harry Harrington
2. "Bonsai Leaf Reduction Techniques" - Online video series by Bonsai Empire
3. "Grafting for Bonsai" by Peter Warren
4. "Air Layering Bonsai Trees" - Illustrated guide on the Bonsai Tonight website
5. "Advanced Bonsai Techniques" by Yuji Yoshimura and Barbara B. Halford

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Safety Concerns**: Deadwood creation involves sharp tools. Ensure proper safety equipment is used and demonstrate safe handling techniques.

2. **Overenthusiasm in Deadwood Creation**: Students may be tempted to create too much deadwood. Emphasize the importance of balance and naturalism.

3. **Leaf Reduction Stress**: Remind students that leaf reduction techniques can stress trees. Teach them to monitor tree health and adjust techniques as needed.

4. **Grafting Frustration**: Grafting can be challenging for beginners. Consider starting with easier techniques like approach grafting before moving to more advanced methods.

5. **Species-Specific Challenges**: Different tree species respond differently to these techniques. Provide species-specific guidance and encourage research on chosen trees.

6. **Long-Term Results**: Many of these techniques show results over time. Encourage patience and long-term documentation of changes.

7. **Material Limitations**: If working with limited plant material, consider having students practice deadwood techniques on collected branches before applying to living trees.

8. **Cultural Considerations**: When teaching in Timor-Leste, relate techniques to local tree species and traditional practices where possible to increase relevance and engagement.
