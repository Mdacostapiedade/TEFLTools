# Lesson Plan: Bonsai Care and Maintenance

## Resources Needed

- Bonsai trees of various species (preferably native to Timor-Leste)
- Watering cans and spray bottles
- Fertilizers (organic and chemical)
- Pruning tools (shears, concave cutters)
- Pest identification charts
- Magnifying glasses
- Calendar templates
- Handouts on common bonsai pests and diseases

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Develop a comprehensive care routine for bonsai trees
2. Identify common pests and diseases affecting bonsai in Timor-Leste
3. Create a year-round care calendar for a specific bonsai species
4. Demonstrate proper watering and fertilization techniques

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Bonsai Health Check:
- Divide students into pairs
- Each pair examines a bonsai tree, noting its overall health, any signs of stress or pests
- Pairs share their observations with the class

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)

Introduce and explain:
- Foliar feeding
- Dormancy
- Transpiration
- Chlorosis
- Fungicide

## Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Watering techniques and schedules
   - Importance of proper watering
   - Factors affecting watering frequency
   - Demonstration of watering methods

2. Fertilization
   - Types of fertilizers suitable for bonsai
   - Seasonal fertilization schedules
   - Application methods (soil vs. foliar feeding)

3. Pest and disease management
   - Common pests in Timor-Leste's climate
   - Signs of disease and nutrient deficiencies
   - Organic and chemical treatment options

4. Seasonal care considerations
   - Adapting care routines to Timor-Leste's seasons
   - Special considerations for tropical species

## Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Watering and Fertilizing (20 minutes)
   - Students practice proper watering techniques on various bonsai
   - Demonstrate and practice foliar feeding

2. Pest Identification (20 minutes)
   - Using magnifying glasses and identification charts, students examine bonsai for pests
   - Groups discuss and present their findings

## Production Task (30 minutes)

Year-round Care Calendar:
- Students choose a specific bonsai species
- Create a detailed care calendar including:
  * Watering schedules
  * Fertilization timing
  * Pruning and maintenance tasks
  * Pest prevention measures
- Calendars should account for Timor-Leste's climate and seasons

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key care concepts covered
- Address any remaining questions from students
- Preview next lesson on bonsai display techniques

## Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a one-page report on a pest or disease common to bonsai in Timor-Leste, including prevention and treatment methods.
2. Begin implementing the care calendar created in class for a personal or classroom bonsai, keeping a log of all activities and observations.

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Foliar feeding: The practice of applying liquid fertilizer directly to the leaves of a plant
- Dormancy: A period in a plant's life cycle when growth and development slow down
- Transpiration: The process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from leaves
- Chlorosis: Yellowing of plant leaves due to lack of chlorophyll, often indicating nutrient deficiency
- Fungicide: A chemical compound used to kill or prevent the growth of fungi on plants
