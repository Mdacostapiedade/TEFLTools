# Lecture Notes

## Watering Techniques and Schedules

### Importance of Proper Watering
- Water is essential for nutrient transport and photosynthesis
- Improper watering is the leading cause of bonsai tree death
- Both overwatering and underwatering can be detrimental

### Factors Affecting Watering Frequency
- Pot size and material
- Soil composition
- Tree species and size
- Climate and season
- Indoor vs. outdoor placement

### Watering Methods
- Overhead watering: Mimics natural rainfall
- Immersion method: Submerging the entire pot
- Misting: For increasing humidity, not primary watering

### Best Practices
- Water thoroughly until water drains from drainage holes
- Water in the morning to allow excess moisture to evaporate
- Use room temperature water to avoid shock
- Adjust watering based on seasonal needs

## Fertilization

### Types of Fertilizers
- Organic: Slow-release, improves soil structure (e.g., fish emulsion, compost tea)
- Inorganic: Fast-acting, precise nutrient control (e.g., NPK balanced fertilizers)

### Seasonal Fertilization Schedules
- Spring: High nitrogen for leaf growth
- Summer: Balanced NPK for overall health
- Fall: Higher phosphorus and potassium for root development
- Winter: Minimal or no fertilization during dormancy

### Application Methods
- Soil application: Granular or liquid fertilizers applied to soil surface
- Foliar feeding: Spraying diluted fertilizer directly on leaves
- Fertilizer cakes: Slow-release cakes placed on soil surface

## Pest and Disease Management

### Common Pests in Timor-Leste's Climate
- Spider mites
- Scale insects
- Aphids
- Fungus gnats

### Signs of Disease and Nutrient Deficiencies
- Leaf discoloration or spotting
- Wilting or drooping
- Unusual growth patterns
- Presence of mold or fungus

### Treatment Options
- Organic: Neem oil, insecticidal soaps, predatory insects
- Chemical: Systemic insecticides, fungicides (use with caution)
- Cultural practices: Proper hygiene, quarantine of new plants

## Seasonal Care Considerations

### Adapting to Timor-Leste's Seasons
- Wet season (December-April): Adjust watering, monitor for fungal diseases
- Dry season (May-November): Increase watering frequency, provide shade

### Special Considerations for Tropical Species
- Many tropical species don't have a true dormancy period
- Continuous growth may require year-round care and pruning
- Protection from intense sun and heat during dry season

# Discussion Questions

1. How might the watering needs of a bonsai tree in Timor-Leste differ from those in a temperate climate? What factors should be considered?

2. Discuss the pros and cons of organic versus inorganic fertilizers for bonsai trees. Which would you prefer to use and why?

3. What are some sustainable pest management practices that could be implemented in bonsai care, considering Timor-Leste's local resources?

4. How can we adapt traditional bonsai care techniques to better suit the tropical climate of Timor-Leste?

5. In what ways might the seasonal care of bonsai trees contribute to the broader horticultural knowledge in Timor-Leste?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Bonsai Care Guide

Create a comprehensive care guide for a specific bonsai species native to Timor-Leste. Your guide should include:

1. Introduction to the species (common name, scientific name, natural habitat)
2. Watering requirements (frequency, method, seasonal adjustments)
3. Fertilization schedule (types of fertilizer, application frequency, seasonal variations)
4. Pruning and shaping guidelines
5. Common pests and diseases specific to this species and their treatments
6. Special considerations for Timor-Leste's climate

Format your guide as a user-friendly document that could be shared with other bonsai enthusiasts. Include diagrams or illustrations where appropriate.

# Assignment Details

## Year-round Care Calendar Project

### Objective
Create a detailed, year-round care calendar for a chosen bonsai species, taking into account Timor-Leste's climate and growing conditions.

### Requirements
1. Choose a bonsai species native to or commonly grown in Timor-Leste
2. Create a 12-month calendar (use a template or design your own)
3. For each month, include:
   - Watering schedule (frequency and method)
   - Fertilization plan (type and frequency)
   - Pruning and maintenance tasks
   - Pest prevention measures
   - Special care notes (e.g., protection from extreme weather)
4. Add notes on seasonal variations and how they affect care routines
5. Include a brief description of the chosen species and its specific care needs

### Presentation
Prepare a 5-minute presentation of your care calendar to share with the class, explaining your choices and reasoning behind the care schedule.

# Additional Materials

## Pest Identification Chart

| Pest | Description | Signs of Infestation | Treatment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Spider Mites | Tiny arachnids, often red or brown | Fine webbing, stippled leaves | Neem oil, predatory mites |
| Scale Insects | Small, immobile insects with waxy covering | Brown or white bumps on stems and leaves | Horticultural oil, manual removal |
| Aphids | Small, soft-bodied insects, various colors | Curled leaves, sticky residue | Insecticidal soap, ladybugs |
| Fungus Gnats | Small flies that hover around soil | Tiny maggots in soil, weak plant growth | Reduce watering, sticky traps |

## Fertilizer Application Guide

1. Liquid Fertilizer:
   - Dilute according to package instructions
   - Apply to moist soil every 2-4 weeks during growing season
   - Reduce frequency by half during fall and winter

2. Slow-Release Granules:
   - Apply to soil surface every 1-2 months during growing season
   - Water thoroughly after application
   - Avoid application during winter dormancy

3. Foliar Feeding:
   - Use a highly diluted liquid fertilizer
   - Spray on leaves in early morning or late evening
   - Apply every 2-4 weeks during active growth

## Watering Technique Demonstration Checklist

- Check soil moisture with finger or moisture meter
- If dry, prepare room temperature water
- Water slowly and evenly over entire soil surface
- Continue until water drains from bottom of pot
- Allow excess water to drain completely
- Check leaves and branches for water accumulation
- Adjust watering frequency based on drainage speed and weather conditions
