- **Transpiration**: The process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from leaves
- **Chlorosis**: Yellowing of plant leaves due to lack of chlorophyll, often indicating nutrient deficiency
- **Fungicide**: A chemical compound used to kill or prevent the growth of fungi on plants
- **Bonsai**: The art of growing and training miniature trees in containers
- **Pruning**: Selectively removing parts of a plant to control its growth and shape

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Bonsai Watering Diagram**: 
   A cross-section illustration of a bonsai pot showing proper watering technique. The diagram should depict water being poured until it runs out of the drainage holes, with arrows indicating water movement through the soil.

2. **Seasonal Care Calendar**: 
   A circular diagram representing the year, divided into Timor-Leste's seasons. Each section should include icons representing key care tasks such as increased watering, fertilization, pruning, and pest checks.

3. **Common Bonsai Pests Chart**: 
   A visual guide showing close-up images of common pests found on bonsai in Timor-Leste, such as spider mites, scale insects, and aphids. Each image should be accompanied by a brief description of identifying features.

4. **Nutrient Deficiency Symptoms**: 
   A series of leaf illustrations showing the visual symptoms of various nutrient deficiencies, such as yellowing for nitrogen deficiency or leaf curling for calcium deficiency.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Bonsai Care Checklist**: 
   A weekly checklist for students to track their bonsai care activities, including watering, fertilizing, pruning, and pest checks. The checklist should cover a month and include space for notes on observations.

2. **Pest Identification Worksheet**: 
   A worksheet with images of common bonsai pests and diseases. Students must identify each issue and write down potential treatment methods. Include a mix of easy and challenging examples.

3. **Year-round Care Calendar Template**: 
   A blank 12-month calendar template for students to fill in with care tasks for their chosen bonsai species. Include prompts for watering frequency, fertilization schedule, pruning times, and seasonal considerations.

4. **Fertilizer Calculation Guide**: 
   A step-by-step guide to help students calculate the correct amount of fertilizer to use based on the size of their bonsai and the fertilizer's concentration. Include practice problems.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Bonsai: The Art of Growing and Keeping Miniature Trees" by Peter Chan
2. "The Complete Book of Bonsai" by Harry Tomlinson
3. Online resource: Bonsai Empire (www.bonsaiempire.com) for tutorials and species guides
4. Local resource: Timor-Leste Botanical Gardens for native plant information
5. App recommendation: "Bonsai Album" for tracking bonsai development and care schedules

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students overwatering or underwatering their bonsai.
   **Solution**: Provide moisture meters and demonstrate their use. Encourage students to keep detailed watering logs to understand their bonsai's needs.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in identifying pests due to their small size.
   **Solution**: Ensure enough magnifying glasses are available. Create a "pest library" with preserved specimens for comparison.

3. **Challenge**: Students becoming discouraged by slow bonsai growth.
   **Solution**: Show time-lapse videos of bonsai development. Emphasize that bonsai is a long-term art form and celebrate small milestones.

4. **Challenge**: Adapting care advice to Timor-Leste's specific climate.
   **Solution**: Collaborate with local horticulturists to create Timor-Leste-specific care guides. Encourage students to experiment and share findings.

5. **Challenge**: Ensuring sustainable collection of local species for bonsai.
   **Solution**: Partner with environmental organizations to teach responsible collection practices. Organize group trips to approved collection sites.
