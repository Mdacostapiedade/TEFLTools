# Lecture Notes

## Traditional Japanese Display Principles

### Tokonoma and Scrolls
- Tokonoma: recessed alcove in traditional Japanese rooms
- Purpose: display art objects, bonsai, ikebana
- Scroll selection: complements season and bonsai theme
- Placement: centered, hung at eye level

### Seasonal Considerations
- Choose trees and accents that reflect current season
- Spring: flowering or budding trees
- Summer: lush, full foliage
- Autumn: trees with fall colors
- Winter: deciduous trees or conifers with minimal decoration

### Balance and Asymmetry
- Avoid perfect symmetry in displays
- Rule of thirds: place main bonsai off-center
- Create visual interest through varied heights and depths
- Use odd numbers of elements (1, 3, or 5) for natural feel

## Modern and Western Display Techniques

### Use of Stands and Tables
- Jita: traditional wooden stands
- Modern alternatives: metal, glass, or custom-built stands
- Height considerations: main viewing angle at eye level
- Multiple tiers for group displays

### Multiple-point Displays
- Sanbon-uchi: three-point display
- Goten-uchi: five-point display
- Varying tree sizes and styles for interest
- Creating a landscape or forest feel with multiple trees

### Accent Plants and Viewing Stones
- Kusamono: grass-like accent plantings
- Shitakusa: small herbaceous plants as accents
- Suiseki: naturally shaped stones representing landscapes
- Placement: complement but not overshadow the main bonsai

## Selecting Appropriate Pots

### Matching Pot to Tree Style and Size
- Pot depth: generally 2/3 the height of the trunk
- Width: varies by style (wider for cascade, narrower for formal upright)
- Shape: rectangular for masculine trees, oval or round for feminine trees
- Consider root system needs and stability

### Color and Texture Considerations
- Unglazed pots for conifers and rugged species
- Glazed pots for deciduous and flowering trees
- Color should complement, not compete with the tree
- Texture can echo bark or leaf characteristics

## Incorporating Timorese Cultural Elements

### Use of Local Textiles as Backdrops
- Tais: traditional Timorese woven cloth
- Select patterns and colors that enhance the display
- Use as hanging backdrops or table coverings

### Integrating Traditional Crafts as Accents
- Carved wooden figurines or utensils as accents
- Ceramic pieces from local artisans as companion items
- Incorporate elements that tell a story or represent local legends

## Photographing Bonsai

### Lighting Considerations
- Natural light: early morning or late afternoon for soft light
- Avoid harsh midday sun or deep shadows
- Use diffusers or reflectors to control light

### Angles and Composition
- Front view: capture the tree's intended display angle
- 45-degree angles: show depth and dimension
- Detail shots: highlight specific features (e.g., flowers, deadwood)
- Use rule of thirds for pleasing composition

### Highlighting Key Features
- Focus on the tree's best attributes
- Capture seasonal aspects (e.g., autumn colors, spring blooms)
- Show scale with subtle size references
- Clean background to avoid distractions

# Discussion Questions

4. What challenges might you face when photographing bonsai, and how would you overcome them?

5. How can the principles of bonsai display be applied to other areas of design or daily life?

6. Discuss the importance of seasonal considerations in bonsai display. How might this differ in Timor-Leste's climate compared to Japan?
