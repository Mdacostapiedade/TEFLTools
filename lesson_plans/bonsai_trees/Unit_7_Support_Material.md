## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to incorporate Timorese elements authentically.
   **Solution**: Provide a variety of local textiles and craft items, and discuss their significance beforehand. Encourage students to research local symbolism and motifs.

2. **Challenge**: Limited variety of bonsai trees or display materials.
   **Solution**: Emphasize creativity with available resources. Demonstrate how to create effective displays with minimal elements.

3. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by traditional display rules.
   **Solution**: Start with basic principles and gradually introduce more complex concepts. Encourage experimentation and personal interpretation.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in photographing bonsai effectively.
   **Solution**: If possible, arrange for a local photographer to give a short workshop. Alternatively, provide step-by-step visual guides and encourage peer feedback.

5. **Challenge**: Maintaining student engagement during theoretical portions of the lesson.
   **Solution**: Intersperse theory with hands-on activities. Use visual aids and real-life examples to illustrate concepts.

6. **Challenge**: Students struggling to critique displays constructively.
   **Solution**: Provide a structured critique format and model positive, specific feedback. Emphasize that critique is about improvement, not judgment.
