# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "The Gifts of Imperfection" by Brené Brown

"Wholehearted living is about engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness. It means cultivating the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, 'No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough.' It's going to bed at night thinking, 'Yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable and sometimes afraid, but that doesn't change the truth that I am also brave and worthy of love and belonging."

## Traditional Timorese Story: "The Crocodile and the Boy"

Long ago, a boy found a small crocodile trapped in a dried-up riverbed. Feeling compassion for the creature, the boy carried the crocodile to the sea. The grateful crocodile offered to take the boy on a journey across the ocean. As they traveled, the crocodile grew larger, eventually becoming the island of Timor. This story teaches us about the power of compassion and the unexpected ways our actions can shape our world.
