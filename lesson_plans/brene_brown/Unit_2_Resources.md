# Resources for Learning Unit 2: Cultivating Authenticity

## 1. Excerpts and Short Stories

### Excerpt from "The Gifts of Imperfection" by Brené Brown

"Authenticity is the daily practice of letting go of who we think we're supposed to be and embracing who we are. Choosing authenticity means cultivating the courage to be imperfect, to set boundaries, and to allow ourselves to be vulnerable; exercising the compassion that comes from knowing that we are all made of strength and struggle; and nurturing the connection and sense of belonging that can only happen when we believe that we are enough.

Authenticity demands Wholehearted living and loving—even when it's hard, even when we're wrestling with the shame and fear of not being good enough, and especially when the joy is so intense that we're afraid to let ourselves feel it. Mindfully practicing authenticity during our most soul-searching struggles is how we invite grace, joy, and gratitude into our lives."

### Short Story: "The Mask of Conformity" (Timorese Context)

Maria grew up in a small village in Timor-Leste, where tradition and community harmony were highly valued. From a young age, she learned to suppress her own desires and opinions to meet the expectations of her elders and neighbors. She excelled in school but hesitated to pursue higher education, fearing it might set her apart from her peers.

One day, a visiting teacher encouraged Maria to apply for a scholarship. Torn between her dreams and the fear of disappointing her family, Maria decided to be honest about her aspirations. To her surprise, her parents listened with open minds. Though some villagers disapproved, Maria's courage inspired other young people to speak up about their own hopes.

As Maria pursued her education, she found ways to honor her heritage while embracing new opportunities. Her journey taught her that authenticity could bridge tradition and progress, strengthening her community in unexpected ways.
