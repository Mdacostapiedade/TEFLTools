## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Participants may be hesitant to share personal experiences due to cultural norms.
   **Solution**: Start with low-risk sharing activities and gradually build up to more personal topics. Use anonymous sharing methods when appropriate.

2. **Challenge**: Conflict between authenticity and traditional respect for authority.
   **Solution**: Discuss ways to be authentic while still showing respect. Emphasize that authenticity doesn't mean disregarding others' feelings or cultural values.

3. **Challenge**: Language barriers in expressing complex emotional concepts.
   **Solution**: Work with local translators to find the most accurate Tetum equivalents for key terms. Use stories and examples to illustrate concepts when direct translations are difficult.

4. **Challenge**: Resistance to change or fear of social consequences for being authentic.
   **Solution**: Acknowledge these fears and discuss them openly. Provide examples of positive outcomes from authenticity in Timorese context.

5. **Challenge**: Varying literacy levels among participants.
   **Solution**: Use a mix of verbal, visual, and written materials. Encourage peer support and group work to help those who may struggle with written exercises.

6. **Challenge**: Balancing individual authenticity with community harmony.
   **Solution**: Explore ways that authentic self-expression can actually strengthen communities. Discuss the difference between destructive and constructive authenticity.
