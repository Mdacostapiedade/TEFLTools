# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "The Gifts of Imperfection" by Brené Brown

"Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joy—the experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light."

## Traditional Timorese Story: "The Brave Crocodile"

Long ago, there was a young crocodile who lived in the rivers of Timor. Unlike other crocodiles who hid their feelings, this one was known for expressing himself openly. One day, he confessed to his friend, the bird, that he was afraid of the dark waters at night. The other animals laughed at him, calling him weak. But the bird admired his honesty and offered to sing for him each night, guiding him through the darkness. Their friendship grew strong, and soon other animals began to share their own fears. The young crocodile's vulnerability had created a more connected and supportive community.
