# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "The Gifts of Imperfection" by Brené Brown (Translated to Tetum)

"Kompaixaun ba an la'os perfesionizmu. Nia la'os koko atu sai di'ak liu. Nia la'os husu ema seluk atu fó aprovasaun. Kompaixaun ba an mak fó domin no komprensaun ba ita nia an bainhira ita monu, falla ka sente la to'o. Nia rekoñese katak ita hotu iha frakeza no halo sala. Liu husi kompaixaun ba an, ita bele hahú atu simu ita nia an tomak, ho ita nia forsa no frakeza hotu."

(English translation: "Self-compassion is not about perfection. It's not about trying to be better. It's not about seeking approval from others. Self-compassion is about giving love and understanding to ourselves when we fall, fail, or feel inadequate. It recognizes that we all have weaknesses and make mistakes. Through self-compassion, we can begin to accept our whole selves, with all our strengths and weaknesses.")

## Traditional Timorese Story: "The Wise Elder's Lesson"

Once, in a small village in the mountains of Timor-Leste, there lived a young woman named Berta. She was known for her hard work and dedication to her family and community. However, Berta was also very hard on herself, always striving for perfection and berating herself for any mistake.

One day, while carrying water from the well, Berta tripped and spilled the entire contents of her bucket. Frustrated and angry with herself, she began to cry. An elder of the village, Mau Leki, saw her distress and approached.

"Why do you weep, young Berta?" he asked gently.

"I am so clumsy and foolish," Berta replied. "I can't even carry water without making a mess."

Mau Leki smiled kindly and said, "Come, let me tell you a story about the bamboo."

He pointed to a grove of bamboo swaying in the breeze. "The bamboo is strong, yet it bends with the wind. It does not break because it is flexible. When storms come, it sways and adapts. But most importantly, the bamboo does not criticize itself for bending."

Berta looked confused, so Mau Leki continued, "Like the bamboo, we must learn to be gentle with ourselves when life's winds blow against us. Your worth is not measured by a spilled bucket of water, but by the kindness in your heart – including kindness to yourself."

Berta reflected on the elder's words. She realized that her harsh self-criticism was like trying to stand rigid against the wind, causing her more pain than the simple act of spilling water.

From that day forward, Berta practiced treating herself with the same compassion she showed others. She learned that self-kindness made her stronger and more resilient, like the bamboo in the wind.
