# Resources for Learning Unit 6: Cultivating Gratitude and Joy

## 1. Excerpts and Short Stories

### Excerpt from "The Gifts of Imperfection" by Brené Brown

"Without exception, every person I interviewed who described living a joyful life or who described themselves as joyful, actively practiced gratitude and attributed their joyfulness to their gratitude practice. And both joy and gratitude were described as spiritual practices that were bound to a belief in human interconnectedness and a power greater than us.

People were quick to point out the differences between happiness and joy as the difference between a human emotion that's connected to circumstances and a spiritual way of engaging with the world that's connected to practicing gratitude."

### Traditional Timorese Story: "The Grateful Farmer"

Once, in a small village in Timor-Leste, there lived a farmer named João. Every day, João worked hard in his fields, but the soil was poor, and his crops often failed. Despite his struggles, João always found reasons to be grateful.

One day, as João was walking to his field, he found a small, shiny stone. He picked it up, admiring its beauty, and tucked it into his pocket. As he worked that day, he felt the stone's smooth surface and smiled, grateful for this small treasure.

That evening, a wealthy merchant passed through the village. Seeing João's stone, he offered to buy it for a large sum of money. João was surprised but declined, saying, "This stone reminds me to be grateful for the small joys in life. Its value to me is greater than any money."

The merchant was impressed by João's wisdom. He decided to stay in the village and learn from João. Together, they worked to improve the village's farming techniques. As the crops flourished, so did the villagers' spirits.

João's gratitude had not only brought him joy but had also transformed his entire community. From that day on, the villagers celebrated an annual "Gratitude Festival," remembering that even in hard times, there is always something to be thankful for.

### Gratitude Meditation Script (to be recorded in Tetum)

Find a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths, allowing yourself to relax.

Think of your life in Timor-Leste. Consider the land, the people, the culture that surrounds you. As you breathe, bring to mind one thing in your environment that you're grateful for. It could be the mountains, the sea, or the smile of a neighbor. Focus on this for a moment, feeling appreciation in your heart.

Now, think of a person in your life who has supported you. Picture their face, remember their kindness. Allow gratitude for this person to fill you.

Finally, consider a challenge you've faced. Within this difficulty, find one thing to be grateful for – perhaps a lesson learned or strength discovered. Acknowledge this growth with thankfulness.

As you prepare to open your eyes, commit to carrying this gratitude with you throughout your day. Remember, even in small moments, there is always something to appreciate in our beautiful Timor-Leste.
