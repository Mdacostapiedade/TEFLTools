# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "The Gifts of Imperfection" by Brené Brown

"Connection is why we're here. We are hardwired to connect with others, it's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives, and without it there is suffering. I define connection as the energy that exists between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgment; and when they derive sustenance and strength from the relationship."

## Traditional Timorese Story: "The Strength of Unity"

Long ago, in a small village in Timor-Leste, there lived a wise elder named Mau Lelo. One day, he gathered all the villagers and presented them with a challenge. He held up a bundle of thin sticks tied together and asked if anyone could break it. Many strong men tried, but none could break the bundle.

Then, Mau Lelo untied the bundle and gave each person a single stick. "Now, try to break your stick," he said. Everyone easily snapped their individual sticks.

Mau Lelo smiled and said, "This is the power of unity. When we stand alone, we are easily broken. But when we come together, supporting each other, we become unbreakable. Remember this lesson in your families and in our community."

From that day on, the villagers worked together more closely, supporting each other through hardships and celebrating joys as one. Their village became known throughout the land for its strength and harmony.

## Guided Meditation Script (to be recorded in Tetum)

Close your eyes and take a deep breath. As you exhale, feel yourself relaxing.

Imagine a golden thread of light connecting your heart to the hearts of those you love. See this thread extending to your family, your friends, your neighbors.

As you breathe, feel the warmth and strength of these connections. Know that you are seen, valued, and supported.

Now, imagine this thread extending further, reaching out to your wider community, to those you don't know well, to those who may be different from you.

Feel the potential for new connections, for understanding, for growth. Know that by opening your heart, you strengthen not only yourself but your entire community.

Take a deep breath, feeling gratitude for all the connections in your life, both existing and potential.

When you're ready, slowly open your eyes, carrying this sense of connection with you.
