## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may be hesitant to share personal experiences due to cultural norms.
   **Solution**: Start with less personal examples and gradually build trust. Use anonymous sharing methods like written notes.

2. **Challenge**: Concepts of vulnerability may conflict with traditional Timorese values of strength and stoicism.
   **Solution**: Frame vulnerability as a form of courage, using local historical examples of resilience and community support.

3. **Challenge**: Language barriers in understanding complex emotional concepts.
   **Solution**: Use visual aids, role-playing, and storytelling to illustrate concepts. Provide glossaries in Tetum and other local languages.

4. **Challenge**: Resistance to changing established relationship patterns within families or communities.
   **Solution**: Emphasize small, gradual changes and respect for cultural traditions while exploring new ways of connecting.

5. **Challenge**: Limited resources or support systems in some communities.
   **Solution**: Focus on building and strengthening existing connections. Encourage creative problem-solving to develop community resources.

6. **Challenge**: Difficulty in practicing new communication skills outside the classroom.
   **Solution**: Assign practical homework tasks that involve low-risk interactions. Establish a buddy system for students to practice together.
