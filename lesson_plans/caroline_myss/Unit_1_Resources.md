## Timorese Folktale: "The Legend of Crocodile Island"

Long ago, when the world was young, there lived a giant crocodile in the seas around Timor. This crocodile was ancient and tired, having swum the oceans for thousands of years. One day, exhausted from his travels, he decided to rest.

As he lay still in the water, his massive body began to transform. His rough, scaly skin hardened and expanded, becoming rocky shores and sandy beaches. His spine grew and stretched, forming mountains and valleys. Plants and trees sprouted from his back, creating lush forests and fertile plains.

The crocodile had become an island – the island of Timor.

The people who came to live on this new land never forgot the crocodile's sacrifice. They treated the land with respect and care, knowing it was born from the body of a great creature. To this day, Timorese people see their island as a living being and consider the crocodile a sacred animal.

This is why Timor is sometimes called "Crocodile Island," and why the crocodile holds a special place in Timorese culture and mythology.
