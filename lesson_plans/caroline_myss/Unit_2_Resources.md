# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Joseph Campbell's "The Hero with a Thousand Faces" (Excerpt)

"A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man."

## Timorese Hero Myth: "The Legend of Rai Nain"

Long ago, in the land of Timor, there lived a young man named Rai Nain. He was known for his kindness and bravery, but his village was suffering from a terrible drought. The elders spoke of a magical spring hidden in the mountains, guarded by fierce spirits.

One night, Rai Nain dreamed of an old wise woman who told him he must find the spring to save his people. The next morning, he set out on his journey, carrying only a small bag of rice and a bamboo water container.

As he climbed the mountain, he encountered a group of mischievous spirits who tried to lead him astray. But Rai Nain remembered the advice of the wise woman and outsmarted them with his clever words.

Higher up the mountain, he met a giant snake that blocked his path. Instead of fighting, Rai Nain offered the snake some of his rice. Pleased by his generosity, the snake revealed a hidden path to the spring.

Finally, Rai Nain reached the magical spring, but it was guarded by a fierce fire spirit. The spirit challenged Rai Nain to walk through the flames. Remembering his people's suffering, Rai Nain bravely stepped into the fire. To his surprise, the flames did not burn him.

Impressed by his courage, the fire spirit allowed Rai Nain to fill his container with the magical water. As he descended the mountain, the water in his container never ran out, quenching the thirst of all he met.

When Rai Nain returned to his village, he poured the magical water into the dry riverbeds. The land came back to life, ending the drought. From that day on, Rai Nain was hailed as a hero, and his story was passed down through generations.
