## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may struggle to identify hero's journey elements in unfamiliar Timorese myths.
   Solution: Provide a clear example analysis of a well-known Western myth first, then guide students through a Timorese myth as a class before group work.

2. Challenge: Limited resources on Timorese mythology in English.
   Solution: Collaborate with local cultural experts or elders to gather and translate myths. Create a class anthology of Timorese myths as an ongoing project.

3. Challenge: Students may overgeneralize or stereotype Timorese culture.
   Solution: Emphasize the diversity within Timorese culture and encourage students to consider regional and historical variations in myths.

4. Challenge: Difficulty in comparing Timorese and Western myths due to cultural differences.
   Solution: Focus on universal themes and character functions rather than specific cultural details. Encourage students to reflect on why differences exist.

5. Challenge: Students may struggle with the abstract concept of archetypes.
   Solution: Use concrete examples from popular culture (movies, books) to illustrate archetypes before delving into more complex mythological examples.
