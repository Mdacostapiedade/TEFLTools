# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Jung on the Collective Unconscious
"The collective unconscious - so far as we can say anything about it at all - appears to consist of mythological motifs or primordial images, for which reason the myths of all nations are its real exponents. In fact, the whole of mythology could be taken as a sort of projection of the collective unconscious." - C.G. Jung, "The Structure of the Psyche" (1927)

## Timorese Creation Myth: The Crocodile and the Boy
Long ago, a boy found a small crocodile trapped in a swamp. Taking pity on the creature, he carried it to the sea. In gratitude, the crocodile offered to take the boy on a journey. As they traveled, the crocodile grew larger, eventually becoming the island of Timor. The boy became the ancestor of all Timorese people, who to this day revere the crocodile as their progenitor.

# Lecture Notes

## Jung's Theory of the Collective Unconscious

1. Definition of collective unconscious

   - Universal, primordial images
   - Manifest in dreams, myths, and cultural symbols
   - Examples: The Great Mother, The Wise Old Man, The Trickster

3. Distinction between personal and collective unconscious
   - Personal: Individual experiences and repressed memories
   - Collective: Universal human experiences and inherited patterns

4. Importance in understanding human behavior and culture
   - Influences individual and societal actions
   - Shapes cultural narratives and symbols
   - Provides a framework for understanding universal human experiences

5. How do tais patterns serve as a form of non-verbal communication of archetypal themes?

6. Compare and contrast a Timorese archetype with its Western counterpart. What are the similarities and differences?

7. How might understanding archetypes in Timorese culture contribute to cross-cultural communication and understanding?
