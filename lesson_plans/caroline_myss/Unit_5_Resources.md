## Timorese Poem: "The Crocodile Legend"

```
From the sea, a crocodile emerged,
Seeking land, its journey surged.
A boy, with kindness in his heart,
Helped the creature, a friendship to start.

The crocodile, grateful and wise,
Offered the boy a magical prize.
"Climb upon my back," it said,
"To a new land, you'll be led."

They swam for days, through sun and storm,
Until an island began to form.
The crocodile's body grew and grew,
Becoming the land the boy now knew.

Timor, shaped like a crocodile's form,
A nation from legend was born.
The boy became the first of his kind,
On an island of mountains and shores intertwined.
```

## Short Story Excerpt: "The Sacred Tais"

```
Marta's fingers moved deftly across the loom, weaving threads of vibrant red and gold. The tais she created was not just a piece of cloth; it was a story, a legacy, a piece of her soul. As she worked, she thought of her grandmother, who had taught her the art of weaving and the meaning behind each pattern.

The diamond shapes emerging from her work represented the eyes of the ancestors, watching over their descendants. The intricate lines connecting them were the paths of life, intertwining destinies across generations. In the center, a stylized uma lulik took form, symbolizing the heart of Timorese culture and spirituality.

As the sun set, casting long shadows across her small workshop, Marta felt a presence beside her. She looked up, half-expecting to see her grandmother's spirit. Instead, she saw only the fading light playing tricks on her eyes. But the feeling remained â€“ a sense of connection to something greater than herself, to the timeless wisdom woven into every tais she created.

Marta smiled, knowing that through her work, she was not just preserving tradition. She was keeping alive the archetypal stories of her people, passed down through generations in every carefully crafted thread.
