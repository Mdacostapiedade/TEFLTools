## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to connect Western concepts of archetypes to Timorese culture.
   **Solution**: Provide plenty of concrete examples from Timorese literature and art. Encourage students to draw parallels with their own cultural experiences.

   **Solution**: Prepare a curated selection of translated excerpts. Collaborate with local Timorese cultural organizations or universities to source materials.

3. **Challenge**: Students may have varying levels of familiarity with Timorese culture.
   **Solution**: Begin with a brief cultural overview. Encourage peer teaching, where students with more knowledge can share with others.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in interpreting symbolic meanings in Timorese art.
   **Solution**: Provide context for common symbols before analysis. Use guided questioning to help students develop their interpretive skills.

5. **Challenge**: Students may feel hesitant to create their own art based on Timorese archetypes.
   **Solution**: Emphasize that the goal is to explore and express ideas, not to create perfect art. Provide examples and templates as starting points.
