## Timorese Folktale: "The Legend of Crocodile Island"

Long ago, a young boy found a small crocodile trapped in a dried-up riverbed. Taking pity on the creature, he carried it to the sea. The grateful crocodile offered to take the boy on a journey across the ocean. As they traveled, the crocodile grew larger and larger. Finally, the crocodile said, "My friend, I have grown old and tired. I will transform myself into an island where you and your people can live." And so, the crocodile became the island of Timor, its ridged back forming the mountains, and its scales the hills and valleys.
