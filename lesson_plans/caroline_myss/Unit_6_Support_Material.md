## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited background knowledge of Timorese history and culture.
   - **Solution**: Provide a brief historical overview at the beginning of the lesson and incorporate mini-lectures throughout to fill knowledge gaps.

2. **Challenge**: Discussing gender dynamics may be sensitive in some cultural contexts.
   - **Solution**: Establish ground rules for respectful discussion and use objective, research-based information to guide conversations.

3. **Challenge**: Students might struggle to identify archetypes in unfamiliar cultural contexts.
   - **Solution**: Start with more universal archetypes before moving to Timorese-specific examples. Provide clear examples and guided practice.

4. **Challenge**: Analyzing power dynamics might be politically sensitive.
   - **Solution**: Focus on historical examples and emphasize academic analysis rather than current political commentary.

5. **Challenge**: Students may have difficulty connecting abstract concepts to real-world examples.
   - **Solution**: Use plenty of concrete examples from Timorese society, and incorporate hands-on activities like role-playing or case studies.
