## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggle to feel belly movement during breathing
   - Tip: Have students lie down with a light object on their belly to provide visual feedback

2. Challenge: Maintaining student focus during breathing exercises
   - Tip: Use guided visualizations or count breaths aloud to help students stay engaged

3. Challenge: Cultural resistance to new practices
   - Tip: Draw parallels between Qigong breathing and local traditional practices; invite local healers to share similar techniques

4. Challenge: Physical discomfort from sitting or standing for extended periods
   - Tip: Offer modifications, such as practicing while seated in a chair or leaning against a wall

5. Challenge: Students feeling lightheaded during deep breathing exercises
   - Tip: Remind students to breathe at a comfortable pace; demonstrate how to return to normal breathing if feeling dizzy

6. Challenge: Difficulty coordinating breath with movement
   - Tip: Start with very slow, simple movements; gradually increase complexity as students become more comfortable
