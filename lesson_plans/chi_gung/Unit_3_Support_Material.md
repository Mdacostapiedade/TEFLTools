1. **Challenge**: Students feeling self-conscious during partner exercises
   **Solution**: Start with very brief partner interactions and gradually increase duration. Emphasize respect and communication.

   **Solution**: Provide alternatives such as seated or standing versions of the exercises. Encourage use of props like folded blankets for support.

4. **Challenge**: Varying levels of flexibility and mobility among students
   **Solution**: Offer modifications for all exercises and emphasize that students should work within their own comfort levels.

5. **Challenge**: Students struggling with visualization techniques
   **Solution**: Start with simple, concrete visualizations. Offer multiple options and encourage students to develop their own that resonate with them.

6. **Challenge**: Maintaining a consistent pace for the entire class
   **Solution**: Use a timer for timed exercises. Provide clear verbal cues for transitions between activities.
