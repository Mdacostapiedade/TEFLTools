## Concept of Qi in Qigong

- Qi (pronounced "chee") is a fundamental concept in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Qigong
- Defined as the vital life force or energy that flows through all living things
- Believed to be the foundation of health, vitality, and longevity
- Qi flows through the body via meridians, or energy pathways
- When qi is balanced and flowing freely, we experience good health
- Blockages or imbalances in qi can lead to physical or emotional issues
- Qigong practices aim to cultivate, balance, and circulate qi

## Similarities to Timorese Concepts of Life Force

- Many cultures have similar concepts of a vital life force
- In Timor-Leste, traditional beliefs often include ideas of spiritual energy
- Some Timorese healing practices work with this energy
- Possible local terms or concepts to explore:
  * "Lulik" - sacred power or energy
  * "Buan" - spiritual force (often associated with negative energy)
  * "Rai-na'in" - spirits of the land, connected to natural energy
- Encourage students to share their knowledge of local concepts
