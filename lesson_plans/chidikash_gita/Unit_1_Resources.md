## Guided Meditation Script

[Breath Awareness Meditation - 10 minutes]

Find a comfortable seated position. Allow your spine to be straight but not rigid. Rest your hands gently in your lap or on your knees.

Gently close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, allowing your body to relax with each exhale.

Now, bring your attention to your natural breath. There's no need to change or control your breathing. Simply observe the breath as it flows in and out.

Notice the sensation of the air entering your nostrils... the slight coolness as you inhale... the warmth as you exhale.

Feel your chest and belly rise with each inhalation... and fall with each exhalation.

If your mind wanders, that's perfectly normal. When you notice that your attention has drifted, gently bring it back to your breath without judgment.

[Allow 5 minutes of silent meditation]

As we come to the end of this practice, take a few deeper breaths. Slowly open your eyes and bring your awareness back to the room.
