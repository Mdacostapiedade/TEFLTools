   - **Tip**: Use physical demonstrations, like having students observe objects in the room (consciousness) vs. their thoughts about the objects (mind).

2. **Challenge**: Students becoming frustrated during meditation exercises.

3. **Challenge**: Cultural resistance to certain concepts or practices.
   - **Tip**: Connect teachings to local Timorese spiritual traditions and values. Be open to adapting language or examples to fit the cultural context.

   - **Tip**: Start with focused attention on the breath or body sensations before introducing open monitoring of thoughts.

5. **Challenge**: Difficulty in maintaining a non-judgmental attitude during mindfulness exercises.
   - **Tip**: Practice labeling thoughts neutrally (e.g., "thinking," "planning") without evaluating them as good or bad. Model this approach during guided exercises.
