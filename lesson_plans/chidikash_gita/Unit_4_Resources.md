# Additional Materials

## Guided Meditation Script: Breath Awareness

Find a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths to settle into the present moment.

Now, bring your attention to your breath. Notice the natural rhythm of your breathing without trying to change it.

Feel the air entering through your nostrils... cool as it comes in... slightly warmer as it leaves.

Notice the rise and fall of your chest and belly as you breathe.

If your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your breath. There's no need to judge yourself – simply return to observing your breathing.

Continue focusing on your breath for the next few minutes, staying present with each inhalation and exhalation.

(Allow 5 minutes of silent practice)

Slowly bring your awareness back to your surroundings. When you're ready, gently open your eyes.

## Timorese Meditation Inspiration: The Tais

The traditional Timorese woven cloth, the Tais, can serve as a beautiful focal point for meditation. Here's how to incorporate it:

1. Place a Tais in your meditation space, either as a wall hanging or as a mat to sit on.
2. Before beginning your meditation, take a moment to appreciate the intricate patterns and colors of the Tais.
3. Reflect on how each thread contributes to the whole, much like how each individual is part of the greater community.
4. Use the Tais as a visual anchor during your meditation, returning your gaze to it when you need to refocus.
5. After your meditation, consider how the wisdom woven into the Tais connects to the insights gained during your practice.
