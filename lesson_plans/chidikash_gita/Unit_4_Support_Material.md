   **Solution**: Encourage students to start with shorter sessions and gradually increase duration. Offer alternatives like walking meditation or seated meditation on a chair.

2. **Challenge**: Students experiencing racing thoughts or difficulty focusing.
   **Solution**: Remind students that this is normal and part of the process. Encourage them to gently return their attention to the breath or chosen focus point without judgment.

3. **Challenge**: Students feeling sleepy during meditation.
   **Solution**: Suggest practicing at different times of day, ensuring proper posture, or trying eyes-open meditation techniques.

4. **Challenge**: Students expressing skepticism about meditation benefits.
   **Solution**: Share scientific research on meditation benefits and encourage students to approach it as an experiment, observing their own experiences over time.

5. **Challenge**: Cultural or religious concerns about meditation practice.
   **Solution**: Emphasize the secular nature of mindfulness meditation and its compatibility with various belief systems. Invite local spiritual leaders to discuss meditation in the context of Timorese traditions.

6. **Challenge**: Difficulty maintaining a regular practice.
   **Solution**: Help students set realistic goals, suggest using reminders or apps, and encourage them to join or form meditation groups for mutual support and accountability.
