# Excerpts and Short Stories

## "The Mindful Fisherman" - A Timorese Tale

In a small coastal village of Timor-Leste lived an old fisherman named Mau. Every morning, Mau would walk to the shore, his weathered hands gripping his fishing net. But Mau was no ordinary fisherman. As he cast his net into the sea, he did so with complete presence and awareness.

Mau's neighbors often wondered why he caught more fish than anyone else, despite his age. One day, a young fisherman named Joao approached him and asked, "Mau, what is your secret? How do you always return with the best catch?"

Mau smiled gently and replied, "My young friend, when I fish, I only fish. When I cast my net, I feel the weight of each knot. When I wait, I listen to the whispers of the sea. When I pull, I am one with the water and the net. I am not thinking of yesterday's catch or tomorrow's meal. I am here, now, with the fish and the sea."

Joao looked puzzled. "But how does that help you catch more fish?"

"It is not about catching more," Mau explained. "It is about being fully present in each moment. When you are present, you notice things others miss. You feel the current change, you see the subtle movements of the water. The fish become your teachers, and the sea, your partner."

From that day on, Joao began to practice mindfulness in his fishing. Slowly, he discovered that not only did his catch improve, but he found a deep sense of peace and connection with the ocean that he had never experienced before.

The tale of Mau the mindful fisherman spread through the village, reminding all who heard it that true wisdom lies in being fully present in whatever we do.
