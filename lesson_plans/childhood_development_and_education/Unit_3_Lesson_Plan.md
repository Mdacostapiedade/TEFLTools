# Lesson Plan: Evidence-Based Approaches to ECCD

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with internet access
- Projector and screen
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts of ECCD intervention case studies
- Flipchart paper and markers for group work
- Copies of WHO's "Nurturing Care Framework"

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify key elements of effective ECCD interventions based on global research
- Analyze the cultural appropriateness of ECCD practices for Timor-Leste
- Design an evidence-based ECCD program tailored to a Timorese community

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Think-Pair-Share: 
- Think: Students reflect on an early childhood experience that positively impacted their development
- Pair: Share this experience with a partner
- Share: Volunteers share insights with the whole class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Evidence-based practice
- Intervention
- Holistic development
- Culturally appropriate
- Nurturing care

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of global research on effective ECCD interventions
- Presentation on WHO's Nurturing Care Framework
- Discussion of cultural considerations in adapting global practices to Timor-Leste

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Small group analysis of ECCD intervention case studies:
   - Groups read and discuss assigned case studies
   - Identify key elements that made the intervention effective
   - Consider how the intervention might be adapted for Timor-Leste

2. Whole class discussion:
   - Groups share their findings
   - Class compiles a list of effective ECCD intervention characteristics

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

Design an evidence-based ECCD program:
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group designs a program for a specific Timorese community (urban, rural, etc.)
- Groups must incorporate evidence-based practices and cultural considerations
- Create a visual representation of the program on flipchart paper

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Gallery walk: Groups display their ECCD program designs
- Brief presentations from each group
- Class discussion on common themes and innovative ideas

## 9. Homework Assignment

Literature Review:
- Students research and write a 2-page summary of an evidence-based ECCD intervention not covered in class
- Analyze its potential applicability to Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

1. Evidence-based practice: Approaches to childcare and education that are based on scientific research and proven to be effective

2. Intervention: A program or strategy designed to promote positive child development outcomes
