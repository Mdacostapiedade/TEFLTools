- Identify and develop quality indicators for ECCD centers in Timor-Leste
- Create a sample curriculum for a specific age group in an ECCD program

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Students reflect on their own early childhood experiences and share with a partner what they believe made those experiences high-quality or not.
- Class discussion: Compile a list of factors that contribute to quality in ECCD programs based on student responses.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Quality assurance
- Curriculum development
- Developmentally appropriate practice
- Learning outcomes
- Assessment criteria

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of quality standards for ECCD programs
  * International benchmarks (e.g., NAEYC standards)
  * Timor-Leste's national standards (if available)
- Key components of quality assurance in ECCD:
  * Staff qualifications and training
  * Child-to-staff ratios
  * Physical environment and safety
  * Curriculum and learning activities
  * Family and community engagement
  * Assessment and monitoring
- Principles of curriculum development for young children
  * Age-appropriate content and activities
  * Holistic development (cognitive, social-emotional, physical)
  * Play-based learning
  * Cultural relevance

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### Activity 1: Developing Quality Indicators (20 minutes)
- In small groups, students develop a set of quality indicators for ECCD centers in Timor-Leste, focusing on one specific area (e.g., physical environment, curriculum, staff qualifications).
- Groups present their indicators to the class for feedback and discussion.

### Activity 2: Curriculum Analysis (20 minutes)
- Provide students with sample ECCD curricula from different countries.
- In pairs, students analyze the curricula, identifying strengths and areas for improvement.
- Class discussion on how these curricula could be adapted for the Timorese context.

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

### Task: Create a Sample Curriculum
- Divide the class into groups, each assigned a specific age group (e.g., 2-3 years, 4-5 years).
- Using the principles discussed and blank curriculum templates, groups create a sample weekly curriculum for their assigned age group.
- Groups should include learning objectives, activities, and assessment methods in their curriculum.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Gallery walk: Groups display their sample curricula and quality indicators.
- Peer feedback: Students leave comments and suggestions on sticky notes.
- Instructor-led discussion on common themes, challenges, and innovative ideas observed.

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Individual task: Develop a detailed lesson plan for one day of the curriculum created in class, including materials needed, step-by-step instructions, and assessment strategies.
- Reading: Assigned articles on quality assurance in ECCD programs in developing countries.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Quality assurance: The maintenance of a desired level of quality in a service or product, especially by means of attention to every stage of the process of delivery or production.
- Curriculum development: The process of planning, implementing, and evaluating learning experiences for students.
- Developmentally appropriate practice: An approach to teaching grounded in the research on how young children develop and learn and in what is known about effective early education.
- Learning outcomes: Statements that describe the knowledge or skills students should acquire by the end of a particular assignment, class, course, or program.
- Assessment criteria: The specific standards or expectations used to grade or evaluate student work or performance.
