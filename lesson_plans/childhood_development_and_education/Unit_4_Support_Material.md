## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited knowledge of international ECCD standards.
   **Solution**: Provide a brief overview of international standards before the lesson and encourage students to review the additional resources.

2. **Challenge**: Adapting international quality standards to the Timorese context.
   **Solution**: Facilitate discussions on local cultural practices and how they can be integrated into quality standards. Encourage students to think critically about the applicability of international standards.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with curriculum development due to lack of experience.
   **Solution**: Provide examples of age-appropriate activities and learning objectives. Consider inviting an experienced ECCD practitioner as a guest speaker.

4. **Challenge**: Varying levels of English proficiency among students.
   **Solution**: Provide key terms and definitions in both English and Tetum. Allow students to discuss in their preferred language and present in English.

5. **Challenge**: Limited resources in ECCD centers in Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Encourage students to think creatively about low-cost, locally available materials for curriculum activities. Discuss how quality can be maintained even with limited resources.

6. **Challenge**: Students may have difficulty understanding the importance of play-based learning.
   **Solution**: Incorporate short videos or demonstrations of play-based learning in action. Discuss the research supporting play-based approaches in early childhood education.
