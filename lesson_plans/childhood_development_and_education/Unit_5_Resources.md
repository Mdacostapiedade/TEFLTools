# Discussion Questions

1. How can we ensure that child development assessments are culturally appropriate for Timor-Leste?
2. What are the potential challenges in implementing standardized assessment tools in rural areas of Timor-Leste?
3. How can monitoring systems be designed to be both comprehensive and feasible given resource constraints?
4. What role should parents and community members play in the assessment and monitoring process?
5. How can we balance the need for standardized measures with the importance of capturing individual children's unique developmental journeys?
6. What are the ethical considerations in assessing and monitoring young children's development?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Exercise 1: Adapting Assessment Tools

Choose one standardized child development assessment tool (e.g., ASQ-3, DDST-II) and write a 500-word proposal on how you would adapt it for use in a rural Timorese community. Consider language, cultural norms, and practical implementation challenges.

## Exercise 2: Monitoring Plan Development

Develop a one-page monitoring plan outline for an ECCD center in Timor-Leste. Include key indicators to be monitored, data collection methods, frequency of monitoring, and how the data will be used for program improvement.
