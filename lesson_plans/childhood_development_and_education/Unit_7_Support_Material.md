## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited knowledge of the various sectors involved in ECCD.
   **Solution**: Provide a brief overview of key sectors (health, education, social services) and their roles in ECCD at the beginning of the lesson.

2. **Challenge**: Students might struggle to understand the complexities of multi-sectoral collaboration.
   **Solution**: Use real-world examples and case studies from Timor-Leste to illustrate successful collaborations and their impact.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty in creating realistic collaboration plans.
   **Solution**: Provide a structured template and guide students through each section, encouraging them to draw from the case studies and examples discussed in class.

4. **Challenge**: Limited understanding of the Timorese context among international students.
   **Solution**: Incorporate brief cultural and contextual information throughout the lesson, and encourage local students to share their insights.

5. **Challenge**: Students may focus on ideal scenarios without considering real-world constraints.
   **Solution**: Emphasize the importance of identifying potential challenges in their collaboration plans and brainstorming practical solutions.
