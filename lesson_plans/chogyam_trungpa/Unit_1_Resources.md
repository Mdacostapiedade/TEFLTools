## Guided Meditation Script

Find a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes or soften your gaze. Take a deep breath in through your nose, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm.

Bring your attention to the sensation of your breath. Notice the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Feel your chest and belly rise and fall with each breath.

As you continue to breathe naturally, become aware of any thoughts that arise in your mind. Notice them without judgment, and then gently return your focus to your breath.

If you find your mind wandering, that's okay. Simply acknowledge where your mind has gone, and then bring your attention back to your breath.

Now, expand your awareness to include the sensations in your body. Notice any areas of tension or relaxation. Again, observe these sensations without trying to change them.

As we come to the end of this meditation, take a deep breath in, and exhale slowly. Wiggle your fingers and toes, and when you're ready, slowly open your eyes.

## Example of Timorese Spiritual Practice: Tara Bandu

Tara Bandu is a traditional Timorese practice that establishes prohibitions or rules to regulate the relationship between people and the environment. It is a form of customary law that promotes ecological and social balance.

Key aspects of Tara Bandu:
- Ritual ceremony to establish the rules
- Sacred objects (often animal horns) used to symbolize the agreement
- Specific prohibitions, such as not cutting certain trees or fishing in protected areas
- Belief in supernatural consequences for breaking the rules
- Community-wide participation and adherence

Tara Bandu demonstrates the interconnectedness of spirituality, community, and environmental stewardship in Timorese culture.
