## Guided Meditation Script: Mindfulness of Emotions

Find a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes or soften your gaze. Take a few deep breaths, allowing your body to relax with each exhale.

Now, bring your attention to your emotional landscape. Notice any feelings present in this moment. Don't try to change them, just observe.

As you sit here, emotions may arise. They might be subtle or intense, pleasant or unpleasant. Whatever emerges, see if you can greet it with curiosity and openness.

If you notice an emotion, you can silently label it: "anger," "joy," "fear," "calm." Notice where you feel it in your body. Is there tightness, warmth, or tingling?

Watch how the emotion changes. Does it intensify or fade? Does it shift into something else?

If you find yourself getting caught up in a story about the emotion, gently return your attention to the direct experience of feeling.

Remember, you're not trying to make anything happen or push anything away. You're simply being present with whatever is arising.

As we come to the end of this practice, take a moment to appreciate your willingness to be present with your emotions. Slowly open your eyes and return your awareness to the room.

## Case Study: Overcoming Self-Deception in Spiritual Practice

Maria, a 35-year-old Timorese woman, had been practicing meditation for several years. She prided herself on her ability to remain calm in difficult situations and often advised others on how to manage their emotions. However, she noticed that she still experienced intense anger when dealing with her family, particularly her mother.

Maria initially dismissed these feelings, telling herself that as a spiritual practitioner, she shouldn't feel angry. She would suppress her emotions during family gatherings and then feel guilty afterwards for not being more "spiritual."

In a group discussion about self-deception, Maria realized that she had been deceiving herself about her progress in emotional regulation. She decided to apply mindfulness of emotions to her family interactions.

The next time she felt angry with her mother, instead of suppressing the feeling, Maria observed it with curiosity. She noticed the physical sensations of heat in her chest and tension in her jaw. By acknowledging her anger without judgment, Maria found that the intensity of the emotion decreased more quickly.

Over time, Maria's practice of emotional mindfulness helped her develop greater self-awareness and compassion. She learned to communicate her feelings more effectively with her family and found that her relationships improved as a result.

This experience taught Maria that true spiritual growth comes not from denying difficult emotions, but from facing them with honesty and compassion.
