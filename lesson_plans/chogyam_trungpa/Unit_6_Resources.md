# Additional Materials

## Case Study: The Sacred Seed Project

The Sacred Seed Project in Timor-Leste combines traditional spiritual beliefs about the sacredness of nature with modern conservation efforts. Local communities work with environmental organizations to preserve native plant species, particularly those used in traditional medicine and rituals. The project involves:

- Seed-saving ceremonies that honor ancestral wisdom
- Education programs linking environmental stewardship to spiritual values
- Community gardens that serve as both sacred spaces and sources of sustainable food production

This case study demonstrates how spiritual practices can be integrated into practical community service initiatives.
