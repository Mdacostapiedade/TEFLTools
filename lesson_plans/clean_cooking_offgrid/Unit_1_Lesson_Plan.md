Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 1: Introduction to Clean Cooking, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Clean Cooking

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and screen
- Laptop with internet connection
- Whiteboard and markers
- Flipchart paper and markers
- Sample traditional cooking stove or images
- Video on global clean cooking initiatives
- Handouts on health impacts of indoor air pollution

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the importance of clean cooking
- Identify at least three health risks associated with traditional cooking methods
- Describe two major environmental impacts of biomass fuel use
- Recognize common cooking practices in Timor-Leste and their challenges

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to share what type of stove they use at home and what fuel they use for cooking
- Create a quick tally on the whiteboard to visualize the most common cooking methods in the class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Biomass fuel
- Indoor air pollution
- Respiratory diseases
- Deforestation
- Clean cooking technologies

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

a) Current cooking practices in Timor-Leste
   - Overview of traditional cooking methods
   - Common fuels used (wood, charcoal, agricultural waste)
   - Challenges faced by households

b) Health risks associated with indoor air pollution
   - Explanation of indoor air pollution
   - Major health issues: respiratory diseases, eye problems, burns
   - Disproportionate impact on women and children

c) Environmental impacts of biomass fuel use
   - Deforestation and land degradation
   - Contribution to climate change
   - Loss of biodiversity

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- Divide the class into small groups
- Provide each group with flipchart paper and markers
- Ask groups to create a mind map of the health and environmental impacts of traditional cooking methods
- Have groups present their mind maps to the class

## 7. Production Task (20 minutes)

- Show a short video on global clean cooking initiatives
- Facilitate a group discussion on:
  * What surprised them about the video?
  * How do the issues presented relate to their own experiences?
  * What potential solutions did they see that might work in Timor-Leste?

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Summarize the key points of the lesson
- Ask students to share one new thing they learned and one question they still have
- Address any remaining questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Ask students to interview an elder in their family or community about how cooking practices have changed over the years
- Students should prepare a short written report or be ready to share orally in the next class

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Biomass fuel: Organic material used as a fuel source, such as wood, charcoal, or agricultural waste
- Indoor air pollution: Contamination of indoor air by smoke and other pollutants, often from cooking or heating
- Respiratory diseases: Illnesses affecting the lungs and breathing, such as asthma or pneumonia
- Deforestation: The removal of trees and forest cover, often for fuel or agricultural purposes
- Clean cooking technologies: Stoves and fuels that produce less smoke and use energy more efficiently than traditional methods
