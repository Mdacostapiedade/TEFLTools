# Learning Unit 1: Introduction to Clean Cooking - Detailed Resources

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Current cooking practices in Timor-Leste

- Traditional cooking methods:
  * Three-stone fires: Open fires with three stones supporting a pot
  * Mud stoves: Simple enclosed stoves made from local clay
  * Metal charcoal stoves: Portable stoves using charcoal as fuel

- Common fuels used:
  * Firewood: Most common, collected from nearby forests or purchased
  * Charcoal: Used in urban areas, often produced locally
  * Agricultural waste: Corn cobs, coconut husks, etc.

- Challenges faced by households:
  * Time spent collecting firewood (primarily by women and children)
  * Smoke inhalation during cooking
  * High fuel costs for purchased wood or charcoal
  * Deforestation in areas surrounding communities

### Health risks associated with indoor air pollution

- Explanation of indoor air pollution:
  * Caused by incomplete combustion of solid fuels
  * Contains particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and other harmful substances
  * Levels can be 100 times higher than WHO guidelines for clean air

- Major health issues:
  * Respiratory diseases: 
    - Acute lower respiratory infections in children
    - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults
    - Increased risk of pneumonia
  * Eye problems:
    - Cataracts
    - Eye irritation and infections
  * Burns and injuries:
    - From open fires and unstable cookstoves
    - Particularly dangerous for children

- Disproportionate impact on women and children:
  * Women spend more time near the cookstove
  * Children often carried on mothers' backs while cooking
  * Contributes to gender inequality in health outcomes

### Environmental impacts of biomass fuel use

- Deforestation and land degradation:
  * Unsustainable harvesting of firewood
  * Loss of forest cover and soil erosion
  * Reduced biodiversity and ecosystem services

- Contribution to climate change:
  * Emission of greenhouse gases (CO2, methane, black carbon)
  * Reduction in carbon sinks due to deforestation
  * Potential feedback loop with climate change increasing vulnerability

- Loss of biodiversity:
  * Habitat destruction from forest degradation
  * Impact on local flora and fauna
  * Disruption of ecosystem balance

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How do the cooking practices in your community compare to what we've discussed about Timor-Leste? What are the similarities and differences?

2. In what ways does indoor air pollution from cooking affect different family members? Who do you think is most at risk and why?

3. How might the environmental impacts of traditional cooking methods affect your community in the long term? Consider both direct and indirect effects.

4. What barriers do you think exist in your community that might prevent people from adopting cleaner cooking technologies?

5. How do you think gender roles in your community influence cooking practices and exposure to indoor air pollution?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a reflective essay (300-500 words) on your personal experience with cooking practices. Consider the following points:

- Describe the type of stove and fuel used in your household.
- Reflect on any health issues you or your family members have experienced that might be related to indoor air pollution from cooking.
- Discuss any challenges you face in obtaining fuel for cooking.
- Share your thoughts on how clean cooking technologies might benefit your family and community.

## 4. Assignment Details

### Interview with an Elder

- Objective: To understand how cooking practices have changed over time in your community.
- Task: Interview an elder (grandparent, older neighbor, or community leader) about cooking practices.
- Questions to ask:
  1. What type of stove or cooking method did they use when they were young?
  2. How did they obtain fuel for cooking?
  3. How much time did they spend cooking or collecting fuel each day?
  4. Have they noticed any changes in the local environment related to fuel collection?
  5. What health issues, if any, did they associate with cooking?
- Format: Prepare a 1-2 page written report or a 5-minute oral presentation for the next class.

## 5. Additional Materials

### Case Study: The Tara Bandu Initiative in Timor-Leste

Tara Bandu is a traditional Timorese practice of setting rules or prohibitions to regulate the relationship between people and the environment. In recent years, some communities have used Tara Bandu to protect forests and promote sustainable use of natural resources, including firewood for cooking.

Read about how the community of Suco Buruma implemented Tara Bandu:

### Infographic: Health Impacts of Indoor Air Pollution

[Insert description of an infographic showing statistics on health impacts, such as number of premature deaths, cases of pneumonia in children, and COPD in adults attributed to indoor air pollution from cooking]

### Video Resource: "The Killer in the Kitchen"

A short documentary (15 minutes) highlighting the global issue of indoor air pollution from cooking and its impact on families in developing countries.

## 6. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

1. Biomass fuel: Organic material used as a fuel source, such as wood, charcoal, or agricultural waste.
2. Indoor air pollution: Contamination of indoor air by smoke and other pollutants, often from cooking or heating.
3. Respiratory diseases: Illnesses affecting the lungs and breathing, such as asthma or pneumonia.
4. Deforestation: The removal of trees and forest cover, often for fuel or agricultural purposes.
5. Clean cooking technologies: Stoves and fuels that produce less smoke and use energy more efficiently than traditional methods.
6. Particulate matter: Tiny particles suspended in the air that can be inhaled and cause health problems.
7. Carbon monoxide: A colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels.
8. Acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI): A sudden infection affecting the lungs and airways, common in children exposed to indoor air pollution.
9. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): A group of lung diseases that block airflow and make breathing difficult.
10. Ecosystem services: Benefits that nature provides to humans, such as clean air, water filtration, and soil fertility.
