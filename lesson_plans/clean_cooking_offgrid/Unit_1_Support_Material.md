Here are the support materials for the lesson on Introduction to Clean Cooking, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Materials for Introduction to Clean Cooking

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Biomass fuel**: Organic material used as a fuel source, such as wood, charcoal, or agricultural waste
- **Indoor air pollution**: Contamination of indoor air by smoke and other pollutants, often from cooking or heating
- **Respiratory diseases**: Illnesses affecting the lungs and breathing, such as asthma or pneumonia
- **Deforestation**: The removal of trees and forest cover, often for fuel or agricultural purposes
- **Clean cooking technologies**: Stoves and fuels that produce less smoke and use energy more efficiently than traditional methods
- **Three-stone fire**: A traditional cooking method using three stones to support a pot over an open fire
- **Particulate matter**: Tiny particles suspended in the air that can be harmful when inhaled
- **Carbon monoxide**: A toxic gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuels
- **Fuel efficiency**: The amount of useful energy produced from a given amount of fuel

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Comparison chart: Traditional vs. Clean Cooking Methods
   - Two columns showing images and bullet points
   - Traditional: Three-stone fire, high smoke, inefficient
   - Clean: Improved cookstove, reduced smoke, more efficient

2. Health Impact Infographic
   - Human silhouette with arrows pointing to affected body parts
   - Lungs: Respiratory diseases
   - Eyes: Eye irritation and cataracts
   - Skin: Burns and scalds
   - Heart: Cardiovascular diseases

3. Environmental Impact Diagram
   - Circular diagram showing interconnected impacts
   - Center: Traditional Cooking
   - Connected bubbles: Deforestation, Soil Erosion, Climate Change, Biodiversity Loss

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited prior knowledge of scientific concepts
   - Solution: Use simple analogies and local examples to explain complex ideas
   - Example: Compare indoor air pollution to a smoky room to illustrate the concept

2. Challenge: Resistance to changing traditional cooking methods
   - Solution: Emphasize health benefits for family members, especially children
   - Approach: Share success stories from other communities or neighboring countries

3. Challenge: Difficulty visualizing long-term environmental impacts
   - Solution: Use before-and-after photos of deforested areas in Timor-Leste
   - Activity: Conduct a simple experiment demonstrating soil erosion

4. Challenge: Varying literacy levels among students
   - Solution: Incorporate more visual aids and hands-on activities
   - Approach: Use peer teaching and group work to support less confident students

5. Challenge: Limited access to clean cooking technologies for demonstration
   - Solution: Use videos and images when physical examples are not available
   - Activity: Encourage students to create models of improved cookstoves using local materials
