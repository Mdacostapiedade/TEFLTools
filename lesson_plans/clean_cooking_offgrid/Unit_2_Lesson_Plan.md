Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 2: Clean Cooking Technologies for Timor-Leste, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Clean Cooking Technologies for Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Various clean cooking technology samples (improved biomass stove, LPG stove, solar cooker)
- Posters or slides showing different clean cooking technologies
- Handouts with advantages and limitations of each technology
- Materials for group activity (large paper sheets, markers)
- Video equipment for case study presentations

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify at least three different clean cooking technologies
- Explain the advantages and limitations of each technology
- Assess the suitability of different technologies for local communities in Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show images of different cooking methods (traditional and clean technologies)
- Ask students to share what they know about each method
- Discuss briefly how these methods might be similar or different to what they use at home

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Improved biomass stove
- LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas)
- Solar cooker
- Efficiency
- Emissions

Use visual aids and simple definitions to ensure understanding.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Overview of Clean Cooking Technologies
- Improved biomass stoves
  * Design principles
  * Types (e.g., rocket stoves, gasifier stoves)
- LPG stoves
  * How they work
  * Safety considerations
- Solar cookers
  * Types (box cookers, parabolic cookers)
  * Principles of operation

### Advantages and Limitations
Present a comparison chart for each technology, covering:
- Fuel requirements
- Cost (initial and ongoing)
- Ease of use
- Cooking speed
- Environmental impact
- Cultural compatibility

### Case Studies
Present 2-3 brief case studies of successful clean cooking programs in contexts similar to Timor-Leste (e.g., rural Indonesia, Philippines)

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Technology Demonstration
- Demonstrate the setup and basic operation of each clean cooking technology
- Allow students to observe closely and ask questions

### Advantages/Limitations Matching Game
- Provide cards with advantages and limitations
- Students match them to the correct technology

## 7. Production Task (40 minutes)

### Group Activity: Assessing Suitability for Local Communities
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group is assigned a specific community context in Timor-Leste (e.g., urban, rural coastal, mountain village)
- Groups discuss and decide which technology would be most suitable for their assigned context
- Groups create a poster explaining their choice and present to the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap the main types of clean cooking technologies
- Review key advantages and limitations
- Discuss how different contexts might require different solutions
- Address any remaining questions from students

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students should:
1. Interview a family member or neighbor about their current cooking method
2. Based on the lesson, suggest a clean cooking technology that might be suitable for them
3. Write a short paragraph explaining their choice and potential benefits/challenges

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Improved biomass stove: A cookstove that burns biomass fuel more efficiently than traditional stoves
- LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas): A fuel made of propane or butane, stored in pressurized containers
- Solar cooker: A device that uses sunlight to cook food without fuel
- Efficiency: The ability to cook using less fuel and time compared to traditional methods
- Emissions: Gases and particles released into the air during cooking, which can be harmful to health and the environment

This lesson plan provides a comprehensive introduction to clean cooking technologies, with a focus on their applicability to Timor-Leste. It combines theoretical knowledge with practical demonstrations and interactive activities to engage students and promote critical thinking about technology choices for their communities.
