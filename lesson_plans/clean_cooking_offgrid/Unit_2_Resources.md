## 1. Lecture Notes

### Overview of Clean Cooking Technologies

#### Improved Biomass Stoves
- Definition: Cookstoves that burn biomass fuel more efficiently than traditional stoves
- Key features:
  * Improved combustion chamber design
  * Better heat transfer to cooking pot
  * Chimney or other ventilation system
- Types:
  * Rocket stoves: L-shaped combustion chamber for efficient burning
  * Gasifier stoves: Two-stage combustion process for cleaner burning
- Benefits:
  * Reduced fuel consumption (typically 30-60% less)
  * Decreased indoor air pollution
  * Often can use existing fuel sources (wood, crop residues)

#### LPG Stoves
- Definition: Stoves that use Liquefied Petroleum Gas (propane or butane) as fuel
- Key features:
  * Pressurized gas cylinder
  * Adjustable flame control
  * No smoke production during use
- Benefits:
  * Clean-burning with no indoor air pollution
  * Fast and efficient cooking
  * Precise temperature control
- Challenges:
  * Initial cost of stove and cylinder
  * Ongoing fuel costs
  * Dependence on fuel supply chain

#### Solar Cookers
- Definition: Devices that use sunlight to cook food without fuel
- Types:
  * Box cookers: Insulated box with reflective lid
  * Parabolic cookers: Curved reflective surface focuses sunlight
- Benefits:
  * No fuel costs or emissions
  * Can be made with local materials
  * Safe to use (no fire risk)
- Limitations:
  * Dependent on sunny weather
  * Slower cooking times
  * May not align with traditional cooking practices

### Advantages and Limitations of Each Technology

| Technology | Advantages | Limitations |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Improved Biomass Stoves | - Reduced fuel use<br>- Lower emissions<br>- Familiar cooking method | - Still produces some emissions<br>- Requires specific biomass fuels |
| LPG Stoves | - Very clean burning<br>- Fast cooking<br>- Precise control | - Higher upfront and fuel costs<br>- Dependence on fuel supply |
| Solar Cookers | - No fuel costs<br>- Zero emissions<br>- Safe to use | - Weather dependent<br>- Slower cooking<br>- Limited to daytime use |

### Case Studies of Successful Clean Cooking Programs

#### Case Study 1: Indonesia's Kerosene to LPG Conversion Program
- Context: Large-scale government initiative started in 2007
- Approach:
  * Distributed free LPG stoves and initial gas supply to households
  * Gradually phased out kerosene subsidies
- Results:
  * Over 50 million households converted to LPG
  * Reduced government subsidy expenditure
  * Improved indoor air quality in homes

#### Case Study 2: Improved Cookstoves in Rural Philippines
- Context: NGO-led program in remote villages
- Approach:
  * Trained local artisans to build and maintain improved cookstoves
  * Community education on benefits of clean cooking
- Results:
  * Adoption rate of over 80% in target villages
  * 50% reduction in firewood consumption
  * Reported health improvements, especially for women and children

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How do the cooking needs and practices in Timor-Leste compare to the technologies we've discussed?
2. What cultural factors might influence the adoption of new cooking technologies in local communities?
3. How might the introduction of clean cooking technologies impact gender roles and women's daily lives in Timor-Leste?
4. What are the potential environmental impacts of widespread adoption of each technology in Timor-Leste?
5. How could the government of Timor-Leste support the transition to clean cooking technologies?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay comparing two clean cooking technologies of your choice. Consider their suitability for a specific community in Timor-Leste, taking into account factors such as:
- Local fuel availability
- Cultural cooking practices
- Economic considerations
- Environmental impact
- Potential health benefits

Conclude with a recommendation for which technology would be most appropriate and why.

## 4. Assignment Details

### Community Technology Assessment

1. Form groups of 3-4 students
2. Each group will be assigned a specific community context in Timor-Leste (e.g., urban Dili, rural coastal village, mountain farming community)
3. Research the assigned community, considering:
   - Current cooking practices
   - Available fuel sources
   - Economic situation
   - Cultural factors
4. Evaluate the suitability of each clean cooking technology for this community
5. Prepare a 10-minute presentation that includes:
   - Brief community description
   - Analysis of each technology's potential
   - Recommended technology (or combination) for implementation
   - Potential challenges and strategies to overcome them
6. Create a visual aid (poster or slides) to support your presentation

## 5. Additional Materials

### Fuel Efficiency Comparison Chart

| Stove Type | Thermal Efficiency | Fuel Consumption (kg/hour) |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Traditional 3-stone fire | 10-15% | 1.0-1.5 |
| Improved biomass stove | 20-35% | 0.6-0.8 |
| LPG stove | 50-60% | 0.25-0.35 |
| Solar cooker (on sunny day) | 30-50% | 0 |

### Local Context Information

- Timor-Leste Energy Profile (2018):
  * 95% of households rely on solid fuels for cooking
  * Primary cooking fuels: firewood (85%), LPG (4%), kerosene (1%)
  * Urban areas have higher LPG use (10%) compared to rural areas (1%)

- Cultural considerations:
  * Traditional dishes often require long cooking times
  * Cooking is typically done by women and girls
  * Open fires serve social and space-heating functions in some communities
