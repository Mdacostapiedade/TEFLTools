Here are the support materials for the lesson on Clean Cooking Technologies for Timor-Leste:

# Support Materials

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Improved biomass stove**: A cookstove that burns biomass fuel more efficiently than traditional stoves, reducing fuel consumption and emissions.
- **LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas)**: A fuel made of propane or butane, stored in pressurized containers, used for cooking and heating.
- **Solar cooker**: A device that uses sunlight to cook food without fuel, typically using reflective surfaces to concentrate solar energy.
- **Efficiency**: The ability to cook using less fuel and time compared to traditional methods.
- **Emissions**: Gases and particles released into the air during cooking, which can be harmful to health and the environment.
- **Rocket stove**: A type of improved biomass stove that uses a small, insulated combustion chamber to increase efficiency.
- **Gasifier stove**: An advanced biomass stove that converts solid biomass into combustible gases before burning.
- **Parabolic cooker**: A type of solar cooker that uses a curved reflective surface to focus sunlight onto a cooking pot.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barriers
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of proficiency in the language of instruction.
   - Solution: Use visual aids extensively, provide handouts in local languages, and encourage peer translation.

2. Cultural Sensitivity
   - Challenge: Some clean cooking technologies may conflict with traditional cooking practices.
   - Solution: Emphasize the health and economic benefits, and discuss how new technologies can complement rather than replace traditional methods.

3. Limited Resources for Demonstrations
   - Challenge: Not all clean cooking technologies may be available for hands-on demonstration.
   - Solution: Use videos, detailed diagrams, and if possible, arrange field trips to see technologies in use.

4. Varying Levels of Prior Knowledge
   - Challenge: Students may have different levels of familiarity with cooking technologies.
   - Solution: Start with a baseline assessment and use group activities to encourage peer learning.

5. Skepticism About New Technologies
   - Challenge: Students may be hesitant to adopt unfamiliar cooking methods.
   - Solution: Share success stories from similar communities, emphasize long-term benefits, and if possible, arrange for students to speak with current users of clean cooking technologies.
