Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 3: Improved Biomass Cookstoves, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Improved Biomass Cookstoves

## 1. Resources Needed

- Clay, metal sheets, bricks, and other locally available materials for cookstove construction
- Tools: trowels, hammers, tin snips, measuring tape
- Sample improved cookstove models
- Posters showing cookstove designs and efficient combustion principles
- Handouts on cookstove maintenance
- Firewood and matches for demonstration
- Safety equipment: gloves, goggles

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify different types of improved biomass cookstoves
- Understand the basic principles of efficient combustion
- Construct a simple improved cookstove
- Perform basic maintenance and troubleshooting on improved cookstoves

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show pictures of traditional and improved cookstoves
- Ask students to discuss in pairs the differences they observe
- Have pairs share their observations with the class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Combustion
- Efficiency
- Insulation
- Chimney
- Rocket stove
- Gasification

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Types of improved biomass cookstoves:
  * Rocket stoves
  * Gasifier stoves
  * Plancha stoves
- Principles of efficient combustion:
  * Complete fuel burning
  * Heat transfer to cooking pot
  * Insulation to retain heat
- Materials and construction techniques:
  * Clay and ceramic liners
  * Metal combustion chambers
  * Insulative bricks
- Maintenance and troubleshooting:
  * Regular cleaning
  * Replacing worn parts
  * Addressing common issues (smoke, inefficient burning)

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

- Divide class into groups of 3-4
- Each group examines different improved cookstove models
- Groups identify key features and principles applied in each design
- Class discussion on observations and comparisons between models

## 7. Production Task: Cookstove Construction Workshop (90 minutes)

- Demonstrate construction of a simple rocket stove
- Students work in pairs to construct their own stove
- Instructor circulates to provide guidance and answer questions
- Test completed stoves for proper function

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (20 minutes)

- Class discussion on challenges faced during construction
- Review key principles of improved cookstove design
- Q&A session on maintenance and troubleshooting

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students to interview 2-3 community members about their current cooking practices
- Prepare a short report on potential benefits of improved cookstoves for these households

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Combustion: The process of burning fuel
- Efficiency: The ratio of useful work performed to energy expended
- Insulation: Material that reduces heat transfer
- Chimney: A structure that vents smoke and gases from a stove
- Rocket stove: A type of efficient wood-burning stove with a L-shaped combustion chamber
- Gasification: The process of converting solid fuel into a combustible gas before burning

This lesson plan provides a comprehensive introduction to improved biomass cookstoves, combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice. The construction workshop allows students to apply their learning directly, while the homework assignment encourages them to consider the real-world application of improved cookstoves in their communities.
