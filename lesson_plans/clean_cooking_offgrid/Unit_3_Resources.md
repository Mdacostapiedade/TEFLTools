# Resources for Learning Unit 3: Improved Biomass Cookstoves

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Types of Improved Biomass Cookstoves

#### Rocket Stoves
- L-shaped combustion chamber design
- Insulated vertical chimney creates strong draft
- Efficient fuel use, typically 40-50% less wood than traditional stoves
- Can be made from various materials: clay, brick, metal

#### Gasifier Stoves
- Two-stage combustion process
- First stage: wood gas produced through pyrolysis
- Second stage: gas burned as a clean flame
- Very high efficiency, low emissions
- Often more complex design, may require electricity for fan

#### Plancha Stoves
- Large flat cooking surface (plancha)
- Enclosed firebox with chimney
- Good for tortilla-making and other flatbread cultures
- Reduces smoke exposure significantly
- Often built as a permanent household fixture

### Principles of Efficient Combustion

1. Complete fuel burning
   - Proper air-to-fuel ratio
   - High combustion temperatures
   - Sufficient residence time in combustion chamber

2. Effective heat transfer
   - Maximize contact between flame/hot gases and cooking pot
   - Optimize gap between stove top and pot bottom

3. Insulation
   - Retain heat within combustion chamber
   - Reduce heat loss to surroundings

4. Proper ventilation
   - Remove smoke and harmful gases
   - Provide adequate airflow for combustion

### Materials and Construction Techniques

#### Clay and Ceramic
- Locally available in many areas
- Good insulation properties
- Can be molded into complex shapes
- May crack if not properly cured or maintained

#### Metal
- Durable and long-lasting
- Good for precise manufacturing
- Conducts heat quickly
- May need insulation to prevent heat loss

#### Insulative Bricks
- Made from materials like pumice or vermiculite
- Excellent insulation properties
- Can withstand high temperatures
- Often used in combination with other materials

### Maintenance and Troubleshooting

#### Regular Maintenance
- Clean ash and soot from combustion chamber and chimney
- Check for cracks or damage to stove body
- Ensure proper sealing of doors and connections
- Replace grates or other removable parts as needed

#### Common Issues and Solutions
1. Excessive smoke
   - Ensure wood is dry
   - Check for blockages in chimney
   - Verify proper air intake

2. Low heat output
   - Check for air leaks in stove body
   - Ensure proper sized fuel is used
   - Clean combustion chamber and air inlets

3. Cracking in clay or ceramic stoves
   - Allow for proper curing time during construction
   - Avoid rapid temperature changes
   - Repair small cracks with clay slip or refractory cement

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How do improved biomass cookstoves address the health and environmental issues associated with traditional cooking methods?

2. Compare and contrast rocket stoves, gasifier stoves, and plancha stoves. Which do you think would be most appropriate for communities in Timor-Leste and why?

3. What are the key principles of efficient combustion, and how are they incorporated into improved cookstove designs?

4. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different materials used in cookstove construction (clay, metal, insulative bricks). How might the choice of materials affect adoption rates in local communities?

5. What are some potential barriers to the adoption of improved cookstoves in Timor-Leste, and how might these be overcome?

6. How can regular maintenance of improved cookstoves contribute to their long-term effectiveness and adoption?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Imagine you are tasked with introducing improved biomass cookstoves to a rural community in Timor-Leste. Describe the type of cookstove you would recommend, explain your reasoning, and outline a strategy for encouraging adoption within the community."

Your essay should include:
- A brief description of the chosen cookstove design
- Justification for your choice based on local conditions and needs
- Potential challenges to adoption and how you would address them
- A step-by-step plan for introducing and promoting the cookstove in the community

## 4. Assignment Details

### Community Cooking Practices Survey

1. Interview 2-3 households in your community about their current cooking practices.
2. For each household, record the following information:
   - Type of stove or cooking method used
   - Fuel source and approximate daily/weekly consumption
   - Common dishes prepared and cooking times
   - Any health or safety concerns related to their current cooking method
   - Openness to trying new cooking technologies
3. Prepare a short report (1-2 pages) summarizing your findings and discussing how improved cookstoves could benefit these households.
4. Include a brief reflection on any challenges you foresee in introducing improved cookstoves to these specific households.
