Here are the support materials for the Improved Biomass Cookstoves lesson plan:

# Support Materials for Improved Biomass Cookstoves Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Combustion: The process of burning fuel
- Efficiency: The ratio of useful work performed to energy expended
- Insulation: Material that reduces heat transfer
- Chimney: A structure that vents smoke and gases from a stove
- Rocket stove: A type of efficient wood-burning stove with a L-shaped combustion chamber
- Gasification: The process of converting solid fuel into a combustible gas before burning
- Plancha stove: A type of improved cookstove with a flat cooking surface and chimney
- Thermal mass: Materials that absorb and store heat energy

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Diagram: "Anatomy of an Improved Cookstove"
   - Description: A labeled cross-section of a rocket stove showing key components:
     * Fuel inlet

     * Insulation layer
     * Pot support
     * Chimney

2. Poster: "Principles of Efficient Combustion"
   - Description: A visual representation of the three key principles:
     * Complete fuel burning (illustrated with flames)
     * Heat transfer to cooking pot (arrows showing heat flow)
     * Insulation to retain heat (cross-section of insulated stove wall)

3. Infographic: "Types of Improved Biomass Cookstoves"
   - Description: Side-by-side comparisons of rocket stoves, gasifier stoves, and plancha stoves, highlighting key features of each

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited materials for cookstove construction
   - Solution: Encourage use of locally available materials, demonstrate adaptations

2. Challenge: Varying skill levels in construction activities
   - Solution: Pair more skilled students with less experienced ones, provide step-by-step guides

3. Challenge: Resistance to changing traditional cooking methods
   - Solution: Emphasize health benefits, demonstrate fuel savings, share success stories

4. Challenge: Difficulty in lighting or maintaining fire in new stoves
   - Solution: Provide hands-on practice, create visual guides for proper fire management

5. Challenge: Concerns about cost of improved cookstoves
   - Solution: Discuss long-term savings on fuel, explore local financing options or subsidies

6. Challenge: Ensuring proper ventilation during indoor demonstrations
   - Solution: Conduct demonstrations outdoors when possible, ensure adequate ventilation indoors
