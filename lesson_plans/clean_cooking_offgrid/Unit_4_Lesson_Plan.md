Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 4: Alternative Fuel Sources, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Alternative Fuel Sources in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- PowerPoint presentation or large posters showing different alternative fuel sources
- Samples of LPG canisters (empty and safe for demonstration)
- Small-scale biogas model or detailed diagram
- Portable solar cooker for demonstration
- Handouts with key information on each fuel source
- Writing materials for students

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify at least three alternative fuel sources available in Timor-Leste
- Explain the basic principles of LPG, biogas, and solar cooking
- Compare the benefits and challenges of each alternative fuel source
- Demonstrate basic understanding of how to use a solar cooker

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide the class into small groups
- Ask each group to brainstorm and list all the fuel sources they currently use or know about in their communities
- Have groups share their lists with the class and create a master list on the board

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas)
- Biogas
- Anaerobic digestion
- Solar thermal energy
- Renewable energy

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### LPG in Timor-Leste
- Explain what LPG is and how it's used for cooking
- Discuss the current availability and potential for expansion in Timor-Leste
- Cover safety considerations for LPG use

### Biogas Production
- Explain the concept of biogas and how it's produced
- Discuss the potential for biogas production from agricultural waste in Timor-Leste
- Cover the benefits and challenges of implementing biogas systems

### Solar Cooking Technologies
- Introduce the concept of solar cooking
- Explain different types of solar cookers (box cookers, panel cookers, parabolic cookers)
- Discuss the advantages and limitations of solar cooking in Timor-Leste's climate

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- Divide the class into three groups, each focusing on one alternative fuel source
- Provide each group with a handout containing detailed information about their assigned fuel source
- Have groups create a poster or short presentation highlighting the key points, benefits, and challenges of their fuel source

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Groups present their posters/presentations to the class
- After each presentation, facilitate a brief Q&A session
- Conduct a whole-class discussion comparing the three fuel sources

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Summarize the key points of each alternative fuel source
- Discuss which fuel sources might be most appropriate for different regions or situations in Timor-Leste
- Address any remaining questions from students

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students should research and write a one-page report on one of the following topics:
  1. The current state of LPG distribution in Timor-Leste and suggestions for improvement
  2. Potential sources of agricultural waste for biogas production in their local area
  3. Design of a simple solar cooker using locally available materials

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas): A fuel gas containing propane and butane, compressed into a liquid form for easy transport and storage.
- Biogas: A renewable fuel produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen.
- Anaerobic digestion: The process by which organic matter is broken down to produce biogas.
- Solar thermal energy: Heat energy collected from the sun and used for cooking or other purposes.
- Renewable energy: Energy from sources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.
