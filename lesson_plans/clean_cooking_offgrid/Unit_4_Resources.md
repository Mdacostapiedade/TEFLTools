# Learning Unit 4: Alternative Fuel Sources - Detailed Resources

## 1. Lecture Notes

### LPG and its potential in Timor-Leste

#### Introduction to LPG
- LPG stands for Liquefied Petroleum Gas
- Primarily composed of propane and butane
- Stored and transported as a liquid under pressure
- Vaporizes into gas for use in cooking and heating

#### Current LPG situation in Timor-Leste
- Limited availability, mainly in urban areas
- Mostly imported, leading to higher costs
- Used primarily by wealthier households and businesses

#### Potential for LPG expansion
- Government plans to increase LPG imports and distribution
- Potential for reducing deforestation and indoor air pollution
- Challenges: infrastructure development, safety training, initial cost for households

#### Safety considerations
- Proper storage and handling of LPG cylinders
- Importance of well-ventilated cooking areas
- Regular checks for leaks and maintenance of equipment

### Biogas production from agricultural waste

#### What is biogas?
- Renewable fuel produced by anaerobic digestion of organic matter
- Primarily composed of methane and carbon dioxide
- Can be used for cooking, heating, and electricity generation

#### Biogas potential in Timor-Leste
- Abundant agricultural waste suitable for biogas production
- Coffee pulp, rice husks, and animal manure as potential feedstocks
- Small-scale biogas digesters suitable for rural households

#### Benefits of biogas
- Reduces reliance on firewood and fossil fuels
- Improves waste management and sanitation
- Produces nutrient-rich fertilizer as a by-product

#### Challenges and considerations
- Initial investment cost for biogas digesters
- Need for consistent feedstock supply and water
- Technical knowledge required for maintenance and operation

### Solar cooking technologies

#### Introduction to solar cooking
- Uses sunlight to cook food and sterilize water
- Requires no fuel, reducing costs and environmental impact
- Various types: box cookers, panel cookers, parabolic cookers

#### Solar cooking potential in Timor-Leste
- High solar radiation levels in many areas
- Suitable for households, schools, and community centers
- Complements other cooking methods during sunny periods

#### Advantages of solar cooking
- Zero fuel cost after initial investment
- No harmful emissions or indoor air pollution
- Can be used to pasteurize water and reduce waterborne diseases

#### Limitations and considerations
- Dependent on weather conditions
- Cooking times may be longer than traditional methods
- Cultural acceptance and behavior change required

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How might increased LPG use impact traditional cooking practices in Timor-Leste?
2. What are the potential environmental benefits and drawbacks of promoting LPG as a cooking fuel?
3. How can biogas production be integrated into existing agricultural practices in Timor-Leste?
4. What cultural or social barriers might exist to adopting biogas technology in rural communities?
5. In what situations would solar cooking be most beneficial in Timor-Leste?
6. How can we address the intermittent nature of solar cooking to ensure its adoption as a supplementary cooking method?
7. Compare the initial investment and long-term costs of LPG, biogas, and solar cooking. Which might be most feasible for different segments of the population?
8. How can the government and NGOs support the adoption of these alternative fuel sources?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay comparing two of the alternative fuel sources discussed in this unit (LPG, biogas, or solar cooking). Consider the following aspects:

- Availability and accessibility in Timor-Leste
- Initial and ongoing costs for households
- Environmental impact
- Cultural acceptability
- Potential for widespread adoption

Your essay should include an introduction, body paragraphs discussing each aspect, and a conclusion with your recommendation on which fuel source has the most potential for Timor-Leste.

## 4. Assignment Details

### Field Trip Report

After the field trip to the LPG distribution center or biogas plant:

1. Write a 2-page report summarizing your observations and learnings from the field trip.
2. Include the following sections:
   - Description of the facility and its operations
   - Key technologies or processes observed
   - Advantages and challenges of the fuel source as observed during the visit
   - Potential for scaling up or replicating the technology in other parts of Timor-Leste
   - Your personal reflections on the experience and its relevance to clean cooking in Timor-Leste

### Solar Cooker Design Project

1. Form groups of 3-4 students
2. Design a simple solar cooker using locally available materials
3. Create a detailed plan including:
   - List of materials needed
   - Step-by-step construction instructions
   - Estimated cost
   - Suggested usage instructions
4. Build a prototype of your solar cooker
5. Present your design and prototype to the class, explaining its features and potential benefits

## 5. Additional Resources

### LPG Safety Handout

Key points for safe LPG use:
- Store cylinders upright in a well-ventilated area
- Check for leaks using soapy water (bubbles indicate a leak)
- Never use an open flame to check for leaks
- Keep cylinders away from heat sources and electrical equipment
- Replace worn or damaged hoses and regulators promptly
- Ensure proper ventilation when using LPG indoors
- Turn off the cylinder valve when not in use

### Biogas Digester Diagram

[Include a detailed diagram of a small-scale biogas digester, labeling key components such as the inlet, digestion chamber, gas storage, and outlet for bio-slurry]

### Solar Cooker Comparison Chart

| Type | Advantages | Disadvantages | Best Uses |
|------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Box Cooker | Easy to build, retains heat well | Slow cooking, limited capacity | Baking, slow-cooking dishes |
| Panel Cooker | Lightweight, inexpensive | Less efficient in windy conditions | Quick meals, heating water |
| Parabolic Cooker | High temperatures, fast cooking | Requires frequent adjustment, can be dangerous | Frying, boiling, large quantities |
