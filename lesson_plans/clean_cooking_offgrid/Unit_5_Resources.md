## Additional Resources
- Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves: https://www.cleancookingalliance.org/
- WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241548885
- Practical Action Technical Briefs on Improved Cookstoves: https://practicalaction.org/knowledge-centre/technology/energy/
- SNV Timor-Leste Energy Program: https://snv.org/country/timor-leste/sector/energy

This syllabus is designed to be culturally appropriate for Timor-Leste, considering the local context of cooking practices, available resources, and community structures. The hands-on activities and community engagement components are crucial for ensuring practical application of the knowledge gained. The course should be delivered in local languages (Tetum and Portuguese) and adapted as needed based on specific regional variations within Timor-Leste.

# Detailed Resources for Learning Unit 5

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Cultural Considerations in Cooking Practices

- Importance of understanding local cooking traditions
  * Cooking as a cultural practice, not just a utilitarian task
  * Role of traditional cooking methods in social gatherings and ceremonies
  * Generational knowledge transfer through cooking practices

- Potential cultural barriers to adopting clean cooking technologies
  * Belief that food tastes better with traditional methods
  * Resistance to changing long-standing practices
  * Perception that new technologies are "foreign" or not suitable for local cuisine

- Strategies for respecting culture while promoting clean cooking
  * Emphasize adaptation rather than replacement of traditional practices
  * Involve community elders and respected figures in promotion efforts
  * Showcase how clean cooking can enhance rather than diminish cultural practices

### Behavior Change Communication Techniques

- Definition and importance of behavior change communication (BCC)
  * Systematic approach to influence behaviors and social norms
  * Crucial for overcoming resistance to new technologies and practices

- Key principles of effective BCC
  * Know your audience: demographics, beliefs, motivations
  * Use multiple channels of communication
  * Repeat messages consistently
  * Make messages actionable and relevant to daily life

- Specific BCC techniques for clean cooking promotion
  * Storytelling: Share success stories from early adopters
  * Demonstrations: Show improved cooking speed, reduced smoke, etc.
  * Peer education: Train community members to educate others
  * Visual aids: Use before/after pictures of kitchens, health impacts
  * Incentives: Offer rewards for early adoption or referrals

### Financing Options for Clean Cooking Technologies

- Overview of common barriers to adoption
  * High upfront costs of new stoves or fuels
  * Lack of access to traditional banking services
  * Irregular income patterns in rural areas

- Microfinance options
  * Group lending models (e.g., Grameen Bank approach)
  * Individual microloans for stove purchase
  * Savings groups for collective purchase of technologies

- Government and NGO programs
  * Subsidies for clean cooking technologies
  * Results-based financing programs
  * Carbon credit schemes to offset costs

- Innovative financing models
  * Pay-as-you-go systems for LPG or electric stoves
  * Rent-to-own arrangements
  * Stove stacking approach: gradual adoption of multiple technologies

## 2. Discussion Questions

### Cultural Considerations
1. How do cooking practices in your community reflect cultural values and traditions?
2. What potential conflicts might arise between traditional cooking methods and clean cooking technologies?
3. How can we promote clean cooking while respecting and preserving important cultural practices?

### Behavior Change Communication
1. What are some common misconceptions about clean cooking in your community?
2. How might different communication channels (e.g., radio, community meetings, home visits) be effective in promoting clean cooking?
3. What role can children play in promoting behavior change around cooking practices?

### Financing Options
1. What are the main financial barriers to adopting clean cooking technologies in your community?
2. How might a savings group or microfinance program work in your community to support clean cooking adoption?
3. What are the pros and cons of different financing models (e.g., subsidies vs. loans vs. pay-as-you-go)?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Develop a strategy for promoting clean cooking technologies in a traditional community that is resistant to change. Consider cultural sensitivities, effective communication techniques, and potential financing options in your strategy."

Your essay should include:
- An introduction outlining the challenge
- At least three specific strategies for addressing cultural resistance
- Examples of behavior change communication techniques you would use
- A discussion of at least two financing options that could support adoption
- A conclusion summarizing your approach and its potential impact

## 4. Assignment Details

### Community Action Plan Development

In groups of 3-4, develop a detailed community action plan for promoting clean cooking adoption in a specific village or neighborhood in Timor-Leste. Your plan should include:

1. Community Assessment
   - Demographics of the target community
   - Current cooking practices and fuel sources
   - Identified barriers to clean cooking adoption

2. Goals and Objectives
   - Specific, measurable targets for clean cooking adoption
   - Timeline for achieving these targets

3. Outreach Strategies
   - Detailed description of at least three behavior change communication techniques
   - Plan for engaging community leaders and influencers
   - Schedule of community events or demonstrations

4. Financing Mechanisms
   - Proposed financing options for community members
   - Potential partnerships with microfinance institutions or government programs

5. Implementation Timeline
   - Month-by-month breakdown of activities for the first year

6. Monitoring and Evaluation Plan
   - Indicators for measuring success
   - Methods for collecting data on adoption and impact

The final plan should be 5-7 pages long and include visual elements such as charts or diagrams where appropriate.

## 5. Additional Materials
