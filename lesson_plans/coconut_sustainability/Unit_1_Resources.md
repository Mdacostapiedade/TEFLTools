- Employs about 64% of the country's workforce
- Main crops:
  1. Coffee (primary export crop)
  2. Rice
  3. Maize
  4. Cassava
  5. Coconuts
- Challenges:
  - Limited mechanization
  - Poor infrastructure
  - Lack of access to markets
  - Climate variability

## History and Current State of Coconut Production

### Historical Timeline
- Pre-colonial era: Coconuts cultivated for local use
- Portuguese colonial period (1515-1975): Expansion of coconut plantations
- Indonesian occupation (1975-1999): Decline in production due to conflict
- Post-independence (2002-present): Efforts to revitalize the industry

### Current Production
- Annual production: Approximately 40,000 tons of coconuts
- Cultivated area: 14,000 hectares
- Main products: Fresh coconuts, copra, coconut oil

### Challenges
- Aging palm populations
- Limited access to improved varieties
- Pests and diseases (e.g., Brontispa longissima)
- Lack of processing facilities

## Major Coconut Varieties in Timor-Leste

1. Tall Varieties
   - East Timor Tall (ETT)
   - Characteristics: Late bearing, high yield potential, adaptable to various conditions

2. Dwarf Varieties
   - Malayan Yellow Dwarf (MYD)
   - Characteristics: Early bearing, smaller size, suitable for high-density planting

3. Hybrid Varieties
   - MATAG (Malayan Yellow Dwarf x West African Tall)
   - Characteristics: Combines early bearing of dwarf with high yield of tall

## Coconut-Growing Regions

- Manatuto District: Largest producer, known for copra production
- Baucau District: Second-largest producer, focus on fresh coconuts
- Viqueque District: Emerging area for coconut cultivation
- Lautem District: Coastal areas with potential for expansion
