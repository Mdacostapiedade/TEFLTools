# Lesson Plan: Coconut Biology and Cultivation Practices

## Resources Needed

- PowerPoint presentation on coconut palm anatomy and physiology
- Handouts with diagrams of coconut palm structure
- Samples of coconut seedlings, if available
- Soil samples from coconut-growing regions in Timor-Leste
- Images or videos of different coconut cultivation techniques
- Gardening tools for hands-on planting activity

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Describe the basic anatomy and physiology of a coconut palm
2. Explain the climate and soil requirements for optimal coconut growth
3. Identify sustainable planting, irrigation, and fertilization techniques for coconut cultivation
4. Demonstrate proper coconut seedling preparation and planting methods

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

1. Display an image of a coconut palm on the screen
2. Ask students to work in pairs and list as many parts of the coconut palm as they can identify
3. Have pairs share their lists with the class, creating a comprehensive list on the board

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following key terms:
- Frond
- Inflorescence
- Endosperm
- Germination
- Intercropping
- Mulching
- Drip irrigation

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Coconut Palm Anatomy and Physiology
   - Root system
   - Trunk structure
   - Leaf arrangement and function
   - Flowering and fruit development

2. Climate and Soil Requirements
   - Optimal temperature range
   - Rainfall requirements
   - Soil type and pH preferences
   - Drainage considerations

3. Sustainable Cultivation Practices
   - Site selection and land preparation
   - Planting techniques (spacing, depth)
   - Irrigation methods (focus on water conservation)
   - Organic fertilization approaches
   - Intercropping and cover cropping benefits

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Coconut Palm Diagram Labeling (10 minutes)
   - Provide students with blank diagrams of coconut palms
   - Have them label major parts and describe their functions

2. Soil Analysis Exercise (20 minutes)
   - Divide class into small groups
   - Provide each group with soil samples from different regions
   - Have students analyze soil texture, color, and pH
   - Discuss suitability for coconut cultivation

## Production Task (40 minutes)

Hands-on Coconut Seedling Preparation and Planting
1. Demonstrate proper seedling selection and preparation techniques
2. Guide students through the process of preparing planting holes
3. Have students practice planting seedlings, emphasizing correct depth and spacing
4. Demonstrate mulching and initial care practices

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

1. Conduct a quick quiz using an online platform (e.g., Kahoot) to review key concepts
2. Address any questions or misconceptions

## Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a 1-page report on a sustainable coconut cultivation practice not covered in class (e.g., vermicomposting, integrated pest management)
2. Design a small-scale coconut plantation layout for a 1-hectare plot, incorporating sustainable practices learned in class

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Frond: The leaf of a palm tree
- Inflorescence: The complete flower head of a plant including stems, stalks, bracts, and flowers
- Endosperm: The tissue inside seeds that provides nutrition for the developing plant embryo
- Germination: The process by which a plant grows from a seed
- Intercropping: Growing two or more crops in proximity to maximize land use and increase biodiversity
- Mulching: Covering the soil surface with organic material to conserve moisture and suppress weeds
- Drip irrigation: A micro-irrigation system that saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants
