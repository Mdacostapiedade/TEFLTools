- Coconut oil extraction equipment (traditional and modern methods)
- Various coconut products (oil, water, milk, flour, activated carbon)
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on coconut processing methods
- Ingredients and tools for product development workshop

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Describe traditional and modern coconut processing methods
2. Explain different coconut oil extraction techniques
3. Identify various value-added coconut products and their applications
4. Demonstrate basic skills in coconut product development

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

   - Coconut flour: production and uses
   - Activated carbon: production from coconut shells

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)
1. Demonstration of coconut oil extraction methods
   - Show students the process of extracting oil using both traditional and modern methods
   - Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method

2. Coconut product identification quiz
   - Present students with various coconut products and ask them to identify the processing method used

## Production Task: Product Development Workshop (60 minutes)
1. Divide students into small groups
2. Provide each group with coconut-based ingredients and tools
3. Challenge groups to create a new coconut-based product
4. Groups present their product ideas, including processing methods and potential applications

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Discuss how the learned processing technologies can be applied in Timor-Leste
- Address any questions from students

## Homework Assignment
1. Research and write a 2-page report on an innovative coconut processing technology not covered in class
2. Analyze its potential application and benefits for the coconut industry in Timor-Leste

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Cold-pressed oil: Oil extracted from coconuts without the use of heat, preserving more nutrients and flavor
- Copra: Dried coconut kernel used for oil extraction
- Virgin coconut oil (VCO): Unrefined coconut oil extracted from fresh coconut meat without the use of chemicals
- Desiccated coconut: Dried, shredded coconut meat used in food products
- Activated carbon: A highly porous form of carbon produced from coconut shells, used for filtration and purification
