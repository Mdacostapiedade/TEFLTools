Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Coconut Processing Technologies and Product Applications, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Coconut Processing Technologies Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Cold-pressed oil**: Oil extracted from coconuts without the use of heat, preserving more nutrients and flavor
- **Copra**: Dried coconut kernel used for oil extraction
- **Virgin coconut oil (VCO)**: Unrefined coconut oil extracted from fresh coconut meat without the use of chemicals
- **Desiccated coconut**: Dried, shredded coconut meat used in food products
- **Activated carbon**: A highly porous form of carbon produced from coconut shells, used for filtration and purification
- **Centrifugal separation**: A method of separating substances based on their density using centrifugal force
- **Fermentation method**: A process of extracting coconut oil using microorganisms to break down coconut meat
- **Dehusking**: The process of removing the outer husk of a coconut
- **Grating**: Shredding the coconut meat into small pieces
- **Value-added products**: Products that have been modified to increase their market value

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Limited access to modern processing equipment:
   - Focus on traditional methods that can be demonstrated with locally available tools
   - Use videos or virtual simulations to showcase modern technologies

2. Language barriers:
   - Provide key vocabulary in both English and Tetum (local language)
   - Use visual aids and hands-on activities to reinforce concepts

3. Varying levels of prior knowledge:
   - Conduct a pre-lesson assessment to gauge students' existing knowledge
   - Prepare additional explanations or simplified content for students who need extra support

4. Limited time for hands-on activities:
   - Prioritize the most important practical demonstrations
   - Consider assigning some activities as homework or group projects outside of class time

5. Difficulty in sourcing diverse coconut products:
   - Collaborate with local producers or cooperatives to obtain samples
   - Use images or replicas when actual products are unavailable

6. Engaging students with different learning styles:
   - Incorporate a mix of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning activities
   - Encourage group discussions and peer teaching to cater to different learning preferences

7. Connecting lesson content to local context:
   - Invite guest speakers from local coconut processing businesses
   - Assign research projects on traditional coconut use in Timorese culture
