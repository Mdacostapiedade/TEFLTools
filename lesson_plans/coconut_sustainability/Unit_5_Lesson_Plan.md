# Lesson Plan: Sustainable Practices in Coconut Farming and Processing

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts on organic farming practices and integrated pest management
- Samples of organic and conventional coconut products
- Flipchart paper and colored markers for group activities

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define sustainable farming practices in the context of coconut production
- Explain the principles of organic coconut farming
- Describe integrated pest management techniques for coconut plantations
- Compare energy-efficient processing technologies for coconut products
- Develop a basic sustainable coconut farm management plan

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display images of healthy coconut plantations and those affected by pests or poor management
- Ask students to identify differences and discuss potential causes for the variations in plantation health

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Sustainable agriculture
- Organic farming
- Integrated pest management (IPM)
- Biodiversity
- Soil health
- Energy efficiency

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### a. Organic Coconut Farming Methods
- Principles of organic farming
- Soil management and natural fertilizers
- Crop rotation and intercropping

### b. Integrated Pest Management for Coconut Plantations
- Definition and importance of IPM
- Common pests and diseases in coconut farming
- Biological control methods
- Cultural practices for pest prevention

### c. Energy-efficient Processing Technologies
- Overview of traditional vs. modern processing methods
- Energy-saving techniques in coconut oil extraction
- Sustainable packaging and transportation practices

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### a. Group Discussion: Organic vs. Conventional Farming
- Divide the class into small groups
- Provide each group with a list of pros and cons for organic and conventional coconut farming
- Ask groups to discuss and add their own points to the list

### b. IPM Strategy Development
- In pairs, students develop an IPM strategy for a specific coconut pest or disease
- Encourage use of multiple control methods (biological, cultural, physical)

## 7. Production Task (40 minutes)

### Sustainable Coconut Farm Management Plan
- Divide the class into small groups
- Each group develops a basic sustainable management plan for a hypothetical coconut farm in Timor-Leste
- Plans should include:
  * Soil management practices
  * Pest control strategies
  * Water conservation methods
  * Energy-efficient processing techniques
- Groups present their plans to the class for feedback

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points of sustainable coconut farming and processing
- Address any questions or misconceptions
- Preview the upcoming debate on organic vs. conventional coconut farming in Timor-Leste

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and prepare arguments for the debate on organic vs. conventional coconut farming in Timor-Leste
- Write a one-page reflection on how sustainable practices could benefit coconut farmers in their local community

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Sustainable agriculture: Farming practices that meet current food needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs
- Organic farming: A method of crop and livestock production that avoids the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers
- Integrated pest management (IPM): An ecosystem-based approach to crop protection that combines different management strategies to grow healthy crops and minimize the use of pesticides
- Biodiversity: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
- Soil health: The continued capacity of soil to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals, and humans
- Energy efficiency: The goal to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services
