# Lesson Plan: Circular Economy Approaches for Coconut Waste Valorization

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Samples of coconut waste products (husks, shells, fibers)
- Craft materials for making handicrafts
- Handouts on circular economy principles
- Video on biochar production from coconut waste

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define and explain the concept of circular economy in the context of coconut production
- Identify at least three innovative ways to utilize coconut waste
- Design a basic circular economy model for a coconut processing facility
- Create a simple handicraft using coconut waste materials

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display various coconut waste products (husks, shells, fibers)
- Ask students to brainstorm potential uses for these waste products
- Record ideas on the whiteboard

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Circular economy
- Waste valorization
- Biochar
- Upcycling
- Closed-loop system

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduction to circular economy principles
   - Definition and key concepts
   - Importance in sustainable agriculture
   - Application to coconut industry

2. Coconut husk and shell utilization techniques
   - Coir fiber products
   - Activated carbon production
   - Landscaping and horticultural applications

3. Biochar production from coconut waste
   - Definition and benefits of biochar
   - Production process
   - Applications in agriculture

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Group discussion: Identify potential circular economy applications for a coconut processing facility in Timor-Leste
2. Pair work: Create a simple flow diagram showing how coconut waste can be transformed into valuable products

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

1. Design a circular economy model for a Timorese coconut processing facility
   - Students work in small groups to create a visual representation of their model
   - Include input materials, processes, outputs, and waste utilization strategies

2. Practical workshop: Making handicrafts from coconut waste
   - Demonstrate simple techniques for creating items like bowls, jewelry, or decorative objects
   - Students create their own handicraft using provided materials

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Groups present their circular economy models to the class
- Discuss the potential impact of implementing these models in Timor-Leste
- Review key concepts and address any questions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 500-word report on a successful circular economy initiative in the coconut industry from another country
- Reflect on how this initiative could be adapted for use in Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

1. Circular economy: An economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources through reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling.

2. Waste valorization: The process of converting waste materials into more useful products, including materials, chemicals, fuels or other sources of energy.

3. Biochar: A charcoal-like substance made by burning organic material from agricultural and forestry wastes in a controlled process called pyrolysis.

4. Upcycling: The process of transforming by-products, waste materials, or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality or for better environmental value.

5. Closed-loop system: A system in which all waste is either reused or recycled, minimizing the need for disposal and the extraction of new raw materials.
