# Support Material for Circular Economy Approaches for Coconut Waste Valorization

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

1. Circular economy: An economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources through reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling.

2. Waste valorization: The process of converting waste materials into more useful products, including materials, chemicals, fuels or other sources of energy.

3. Biochar: A charcoal-like substance made by burning organic material from agricultural and forestry wastes in a controlled process called pyrolysis.

4. Upcycling: The process of transforming by-products, waste materials, or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality or for better environmental value.

5. Closed-loop system: A system in which all waste is either reused or recycled, minimizing the need for disposal and the extraction of new raw materials.

6. Coir fiber: Natural fiber extracted from the outer husk of coconuts, used in various applications such as ropes, mats, and brushes.

7. Activated carbon: A form of carbon processed to have small, low-volume pores that increase the surface area available for adsorption or chemical reactions.

8. Pyrolysis: The thermal decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Circular Economy Diagram:
   - A circular diagram showing the flow of materials in a coconut processing facility
   - Includes: Raw material input, processing, product output, waste collection, waste processing, and reintegration into the system
   - Arrows connecting each stage to demonstrate the circular nature of the process

2. Coconut Waste Products Infographic:
   - Visual representation of a coconut, with labels pointing to different parts (husk, shell, meat, water)
   - Alongside each part, list potential products or uses (e.g., coir fiber from husk, activated carbon from shell)

3. Biochar Production Process Flowchart:
   - Step-by-step visual representation of the biochar production process
   - Includes: Coconut waste collection, drying, pyrolysis reactor, cooling, and final product

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Circular Economy Principles Handout:
   - One-page summary of key circular economy principles
   - Examples of how these principles apply to coconut production

2. Coconut Waste Utilization Worksheet:
   - Table with columns: Coconut part, Traditional use, Innovative use, Potential benefits
   - Students fill in the table based on class discussions and their own research

3. Circular Economy Model Design Template:
   - Blank circular diagram for students to fill in during the group activity
   - Prompts for key elements to include in their model

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may struggle to understand the concept of circular economy.
   Solution: Use relatable examples from everyday life, such as recycling programs or composting. Provide visual aids and hands-on activities to reinforce the concept.

2. Challenge: Limited access to coconut waste materials for hands-on activities.
   Solution: Prepare alternative materials that can simulate coconut waste, such as cardboard for husks or small wooden balls for shells. Alternatively, organize a field trip to a local coconut processing facility.

3. Challenge: Students may have difficulty designing a circular economy model.
   Solution: Provide a step-by-step guide and a template for the model. Start with a simple example and gradually increase complexity. Encourage group work to promote idea sharing.

4. Challenge: Varying levels of prior knowledge about coconut production among students.
   Solution: Conduct a brief pre-assessment to gauge students' knowledge. Provide additional resources for those who need more background information, and offer extension activities for advanced students.

5. Challenge: Limited time to cover all aspects of coconut waste valorization.
   Solution: Prioritize key concepts and focus on the most relevant applications for Timor-Leste. Assign additional topics as homework or research projects for students to explore independently.
