# Lesson Plan: Environmental and Economic Impacts of the Coconut Industry in Timor-Leste

## Resources Needed

- Computers with internet access
- Projector and screen
- Whiteboard and markers
- Printed handouts of simplified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) templates
- Guest speaker (local coconut farmer or industry expert)
- Coconut products for demonstration (oil, water, husks, shells)

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain the concept of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and its application to coconut products
2. Analyze the carbon sequestration potential of coconut plantations in Timor-Leste
3. Evaluate the economic impact of coconut farming on rural communities in Timor-Leste
4. Conduct a simplified LCA for a coconut product
5. Identify key environmental and economic challenges faced by coconut farmers in Timor-Leste

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

1. Display various coconut products (oil, water, husks, shells) on a table.
2. Ask students to brainstorm potential environmental impacts (positive and negative) associated with the production of each item.
3. Record responses on the whiteboard and briefly discuss.

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
- Carbon sequestration
- Environmental footprint
- Economic impact
- Rural livelihoods
- Sustainability indicators

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### 1. Introduction to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) (15 minutes)
- Define LCA and its importance in assessing environmental impacts
- Explain the stages of LCA: raw material extraction, production, use, and disposal
- Discuss how LCA can be applied to coconut products in Timor-Leste

### 2. Carbon Sequestration Potential of Coconut Plantations (10 minutes)
- Explain the concept of carbon sequestration
- Discuss the role of coconut plantations in carbon storage
- Present data on carbon sequestration rates for coconut palms in tropical regions

### 3. Economic Impact of Coconut Farming on Rural Communities (15 minutes)
- Overview of the coconut industry's contribution to Timor-Leste's economy
- Discuss the role of coconut farming in rural livelihoods
- Present case studies of successful coconut farming communities in Timor-Leste

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### 1. Simplified LCA Exercise (20 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Distribute simplified LCA templates and assign a coconut product to each group
- Guide students through the process of completing a basic LCA for their assigned product

### 2. Economic Impact Analysis (10 minutes)
- In the same groups, have students brainstorm potential economic benefits and challenges of coconut farming for rural communities
- Ask groups to share their findings with the class

## Production Tasks (40 minutes)

### 1. Guest Speaker Q&A Session (25 minutes)
- Introduce guest speaker (local coconut farmer or industry expert)
- Allow the speaker to share their experiences and insights on environmental and economic impacts of coconut farming
- Facilitate a Q&A session between students and the guest speaker

### 2. Group Presentations (15 minutes)
- Ask student groups to present their simplified LCA findings and economic impact analysis
- Encourage peer feedback and discussion

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

1. Summarize key points from the lesson
2. Conduct a quick quiz using an online platform (e.g., Kahoot) to assess understanding of main concepts
3. Address any remaining questions or concerns

## Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:
   - Strategies to improve the environmental sustainability of coconut production in Timor-Leste
   - Proposals to enhance the economic benefits of coconut farming for rural communities in Timor-Leste
   - Comparison of the environmental footprint of coconut oil production in Timor-Leste vs. a major producing country (e.g., Philippines or Indonesia)

2. Prepare 3-5 interview questions for local coconut farmers, focusing on environmental and economic challenges they face

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

1. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA): A methodology for assessing environmental impacts associated with all stages of a product's life, from raw material extraction through production, use, and disposal.

2. Carbon sequestration: The process of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide, often referring to the absorption of CO2 by trees and plants.

3. Environmental footprint: The impact of human activities on the environment, measured in terms of resource use, pollution, and ecosystem degradation.

4. Economic impact: The effect of an event, policy, or market trend on the economy of a specific area, often measured in terms of employment, income, or economic growth.

5. Rural livelihoods: The capabilities, assets, and activities required for people living in rural areas to secure their basic needs and improve their quality of life.

6. Sustainability indicators: Measurable aspects of ecological, economic, and social systems that can be used to evaluate the degree of sustainability of a process or product.
