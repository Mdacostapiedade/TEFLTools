## History of Coffee in Timor-Leste

### Introduction by Portuguese Colonists
- Coffee introduced to Timor-Leste in the early 19th century
- First plantations established around 1815
- Initially grown in small quantities by Portuguese settlers
- Gradually adopted by local Timorese farmers

### Coffee During Indonesian Occupation (1975-1999)
- Coffee production continued but faced challenges
- Limited investment in infrastructure and farmer support
- Used as a means of economic control by occupying forces
- Some farmers abandoned coffee farms due to conflict

### Post-Independence Era (2002-present)
- Coffee emerges as a crucial export crop
- Government and NGOs invest in revitalizing the coffee sector
- Focus on improving quality and accessing specialty markets
- Symbol of economic hope and cultural identity for Timor-Leste

## Overview of Timor-Leste's Coffee Industry

### Current Production Statistics
- Annual production: approximately 10,000-12,000 tons
- Coffee accounts for about 80% of the country's agricultural exports
- Approximately 25% of households involved in coffee production

### Major Growing Regions
- Ermera: Largest coffee-producing district
- Aileu: Known for high-quality Arabica
- Liquiçá: Coastal region with unique microclimates
- Ainaro: High-altitude regions producing sought-after beans

### Export Markets and Economic Impact
- Main export destinations: USA, Germany, Indonesia, Portugal, Australia
- Coffee contributes to about 25% of non-oil GDP
- Provides income for an estimated 50,000 families
- Challenges: price volatility, aging trees, limited processing infrastructure

## Local Coffee Varieties

### Timor Hybrid
- Natural cross between Arabica and Robusta, discovered in 1927
- Resistant to coffee leaf rust
- Used in breeding programs worldwide for disease resistance
- Characteristics: medium body, low acidity, earthy flavors

### Typica
- Traditional Arabica variety in Timor-Leste
- Introduced by Portuguese in the 19th century
- Characteristics: clean cup, good acidity, floral notes
- Challenges: susceptible to diseases, especially coffee leaf rust

### Bourbon
- Introduced later than Typica, gaining popularity
- Adapted well to Timor-Leste's growing conditions
- Characteristics: sweet flavor, medium body, crisp acidity
- Higher yield potential compared to Typica
