# Lesson Plan: Sustainable Coffee Cultivation Practices

## 1. Resources Needed

- Soil testing kits
- Compost samples
- Various organic materials for composting demonstration
- Agroforestry system diagrams or models
- Samples of organic fertilizers
- Handouts on soil conservation techniques
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Notebooks and pens for students

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the principles of agroforestry systems in coffee production
- Describe at least three organic farming practices suitable for coffee cultivation
- Demonstrate basic soil testing techniques
- Explain the importance of soil conservation in coffee farming
- Create a simple compost pile using local materials

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Ask each group to list as many sustainable farming practices as they can think of in 5 minutes
- Have groups share their lists, discussing which practices might be most relevant to coffee farming in Timor-Leste

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Agroforestry
- Organic farming
- Soil conservation
- Composting
- Biodiversity
- Erosion control

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### Agroforestry Systems in Coffee Production (15 minutes)
- Define agroforestry and its benefits for coffee production
- Explain common agroforestry systems used in coffee farming
- Discuss shade trees and their role in coffee cultivation

### Organic Farming Practices (15 minutes)
- Introduce principles of organic farming
- Discuss organic fertilizers and pest control methods suitable for coffee
- Explain benefits of organic practices for soil health and coffee quality

### Soil Conservation Techniques (10 minutes)
- Discuss importance of soil conservation in coffee farming
- Explain methods such as contour planting, terracing, and cover cropping
- Highlight the role of soil conservation in preventing erosion and maintaining soil fertility

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Soil Testing Demonstration (15 minutes)
- Demonstrate how to use basic soil testing kits
- Guide students through the process of testing soil pH and nutrient levels
- Discuss interpretation of results and implications for coffee farming

### Composting Demonstration (15 minutes)
- Show students how to create a simple compost pile using local materials
- Explain the layering process and ideal compost ingredients
- Discuss the benefits of compost for coffee plants

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

### Group Activity: Design an Agroforestry System (20 minutes)
- Divide students into groups
- Each group designs a simple agroforestry system for a coffee farm, including:
  * Types of shade trees
  * Spacing of coffee plants and shade trees
  * Additional crops or plants for biodiversity
- Groups present their designs to the class

### Individual Task: Soil Conservation Plan (10 minutes)
- Students create a brief soil conservation plan for a hypothetical sloped coffee farm
- Plans should include at least three conservation techniques discussed in the lesson

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Ask students to share one new thing they learned and how they might apply it
- Address any remaining questions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a one-page report on a successful agroforestry coffee farm in another country
- Identify three practices from this farm that could be adapted for use in Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Agroforestry: A land use management system where trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland
- Organic farming: A method of crop and livestock production that avoids the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers
- Soil conservation: The prevention of soil loss from erosion or reduced fertility caused by overuse, acidification, salinization, or other chemical soil contamination
- Composting: The natural process of recycling organic matter, such as leaves and food scraps, into a valuable fertilizer
- Biodiversity: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
- Erosion control: The practice of preventing or controlling wind or water erosion in agriculture, land development, and construction
