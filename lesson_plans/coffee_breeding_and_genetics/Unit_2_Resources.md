## Agroforestry Systems in Coffee Production

### Introduction to Agroforestry
- Definition: Intentional integration of trees and shrubs into crop and animal farming systems
- Benefits for coffee production:
  * Shade management
  * Soil improvement
  * Biodiversity enhancement
  * Additional income sources

### Common Agroforestry Systems for Coffee
1. Coffee with shade trees
   - Examples: Inga spp., Erythrina spp., Gliricidia sepium
   - Benefits: Temperature regulation, nitrogen fixation, leaf litter for mulch
2. Coffee with fruit trees
   - Examples: Avocado, citrus, banana
   - Benefits: Diversified income, improved soil structure
3. Coffee with timber trees
   - Examples: Grevillea robusta, Cedrela odorata
   - Benefits: Long-term income, windbreaks

### Implementing Agroforestry in Timor-Leste
- Consider local tree species and their compatibility with coffee
- Optimal spacing: 6-8 meters between shade trees
- Pruning management for light regulation
- Integration with traditional farming practices

## Organic Farming Practices

### Principles of Organic Coffee Farming
1. Soil fertility management
2. Ecological pest and disease control
3. Biodiversity conservation
4. Minimal external inputs

### Organic Fertilizers for Coffee
- Compost: Made from coffee pulp, animal manure, and plant residues
- Vermicompost: Using earthworms to create nutrient-rich castings
- Green manures: Leguminous cover crops (e.g., Calopogonium mucunoides)
- Organic mulches: Coffee husks, leaf litter, pruning residues

### Organic Pest and Disease Management
- Cultural controls: Proper pruning, shade management, resistant varieties
- Biological controls: Encouraging beneficial insects, birds
- Botanical pesticides: Neem oil, pyrethrum, garlic-chili spray
- Pheromone traps for coffee berry borer

### Certification Considerations
- Organic certification process and requirements
- Potential premium prices for certified organic coffee
- Record-keeping and traceability

## Soil Conservation Techniques

### Importance of Soil Conservation in Coffee Farming
- Prevents erosion on sloped terrain
- Maintains soil fertility and structure
- Improves water retention and reduces runoff
- Enhances long-term sustainability of coffee plantations

### Contour Planting
- Planting coffee trees along contour lines of equal elevation
- Benefits: Reduces water runoff, prevents soil erosion
- Implementation: Use A-frame level to mark contour lines

### Terracing
- Creating level platforms on sloped land
- Types: Bench terraces, sloping terraces
- Benefits: Increases cultivable area, reduces erosion, improves water management
- Considerations: Labor-intensive, requires maintenance

### Cover Cropping
- Planting beneficial ground cover between coffee rows
- Examples: Arachis pintoi, Desmodium spp.
- Benefits: Prevents soil erosion, adds organic matter, suppresses weeds
- Management: Regular trimming to prevent competition with coffee

### Mulching
- Applying organic material around coffee trees
- Materials: Coffee pulp, leaf litter, pruning residues
- Benefits: Moisture retention, weed suppression, gradual nutrient release
- Application: 5-10 cm layer, keeping mulch away from tree trunk

### Living Barriers
- Planting dense hedgerows along contour lines
- Species: Vetiver grass, Leucaena leucocephala
- Benefits: Reduces water runoff, traps sediment, provides additional biomass

# Discussion Questions

1. How can agroforestry systems be adapted to suit the specific environmental conditions of Timor-Leste?

2. What are the potential challenges in transitioning from conventional to organic coffee farming in Timor-Leste, and how might these be overcome?

3. Discuss the trade-offs between short-term productivity and long-term sustainability in coffee farming. How do soil conservation practices factor into this balance?

4. How might traditional Timorese farming practices be integrated with modern sustainable coffee cultivation techniques?

5. What role can farmer cooperatives play in promoting and implementing sustainable coffee farming practices in Timor-Leste?

6. How might climate change impact the effectiveness of current soil conservation techniques, and what adaptations might be necessary?

7. Discuss the potential economic impacts of implementing agroforestry systems and organic farming practices for small-scale coffee farmers in Timor-Leste.

8. How can we ensure that sustainable farming practices are culturally appropriate and acceptable to Timorese coffee farmers?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Sustainable Coffee Farm Design

Imagine you are tasked with designing a sustainable coffee farm for a small-scale farmer in Timor-Leste. Write a detailed plan (500-750 words) that incorporates the following elements:

1. An agroforestry system suitable for coffee production
2. Organic farming practices
3. Soil conservation techniques

Your plan should include:

- A brief description of the hypothetical farm (location, size, current conditions)
- Specific tree species to be used in the agroforestry system and their benefits
- At least three organic farming practices and how they will be implemented
- At least two soil conservation techniques and their application
- Consideration of local environmental conditions and cultural practices
- A brief discussion of potential challenges and how they might be addressed

Be sure to justify your choices based on the principles learned in this week's lessons. Use clear, concise language and organize your plan with appropriate headings and subheadings.

# Assignment Details

## Field Analysis and Improvement Plan

1. Visit a local coffee farm in your area (with permission from the farmer).

2. Conduct a basic analysis of the farm's current practices, focusing on:
   - Presence or absence of agroforestry elements
   - Current farming practices (conventional or organic)
   - Existing soil conservation methods

3. Perform a simple soil test using the kits provided in class.

4. Based on your observations and soil test results, create a detailed improvement plan for the farm that includes:
   - Recommendations for implementing or enhancing agroforestry practices
   - Suggestions for transitioning to or improving organic farming methods
   - Proposed soil conservation techniques suitable for the specific site

5. Prepare a 5-7 minute presentation of your findings and recommendations to share with the class.

6. Write a 2-3 page report summarizing your analysis and improvement plan, including:
   - Description of the current farm conditions
   - Results of the soil test
   - Detailed recommendations with justifications
   - Potential challenges and proposed solutions
   - A simple diagram or sketch of your proposed farm layout

Submit your report and presentation slides by the beginning of next week's class.

# Additional Materials

## Soil Testing Guide

### Materials Needed:
- Soil pH test kit
- Soil NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) test kit
- Clean containers for soil samples
- Distilled water
- Spoon or small trowel
- Paper and pen for recording results

### Steps:
1. Collect soil samples from 5-10 different locations around the coffee farm, focusing on areas where coffee trees are planted.
2. Mix the samples together to create a composite sample.
3. Follow the instructions provided with your specific soil test kit for pH and NPK testing.
4. Record the results for each test.
5. Interpret the results using the following general guidelines:

   - pH:
     * 6.0-6.5: Ideal for coffee
     * <6.0: Too acidic, consider liming
     * >7.0: Too alkaline, consider adding organic matter

   - Nitrogen (N):
     * Low: 0-25 ppm
     * Medium: 25-50 ppm
     * High: 50+ ppm

   - Phosphorus (P):
     * Low: 0-15 ppm
     * Medium: 15-30 ppm
     * High: 30+ ppm

   - Potassium (K):
     * Low: 0-150 ppm
     * Medium: 150-250 ppm
     * High: 250+ ppm

6. Based on the results, make recommendations for soil amendments or changes in farming practices.
