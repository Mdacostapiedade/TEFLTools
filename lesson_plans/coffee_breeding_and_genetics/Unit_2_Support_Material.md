# Support Material for Sustainable Coffee Cultivation Practices Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Agroforestry**: A land use management system where trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland.
- **Organic farming**: A method of crop and livestock production that avoids the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers.
- **Soil conservation**: The prevention of soil loss from erosion or reduced fertility caused by overuse, acidification, salinization, or other chemical soil contamination.
- **Composting**: The natural process of recycling organic matter, such as leaves and food scraps, into a valuable fertilizer.
- **Biodiversity**: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem.
- **Erosion control**: The practice of preventing or controlling wind or water erosion in agriculture, land development, and construction.
- **Shade trees**: Trees planted to provide shade for coffee plants, helping to regulate temperature and moisture.
- **Contour planting**: A farming practice of planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines.
- **Terracing**: A technique of cutting flat platforms into a hilly or mountainous landscape to reduce erosion and surface runoff.
- **Cover cropping**: The practice of planting a crop to cover the soil rather than for the purpose of being harvested.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Agroforestry System Diagram:
   - A cross-section illustration showing coffee plants growing under shade trees, with labels indicating:
     * Canopy layer (tall shade trees)
     * Mid-story layer (smaller fruit or nitrogen-fixing trees)
     * Coffee layer
     * Ground cover layer (herbs or legumes)

2. Soil Conservation Techniques Illustration:
   - A hillside diagram showing:
     * Contour planting lines
     * Terraced sections
     * Cover crops between coffee rows
     * Erosion control barriers (e.g., stone walls or vegetative strips)

3. Composting Process Infographic:
   - A step-by-step visual guide showing:
     * Layering of green and brown materials
     * Proper moisture levels
     * Turning process
     * Finished compost

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Soil Testing Worksheet:
   - Table for recording soil test results (pH, N, P, K levels)
   - Space to interpret results and recommend amendments
   - Questions on how results might affect coffee cultivation

2. Agroforestry Design Template:
   - Grid paper for sketching farm layout
   - Checklist of elements to include (shade trees, coffee plants, other crops)
   - Space to explain rationale for design choices

3. Soil Conservation Plan Outline:
   - Prompts for describing farm topography
   - List of conservation techniques to choose from
   - Space to explain implementation of chosen techniques

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Agroforestry in Coffee Production" - World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF)
2. "Organic Coffee: Sustainable Development by Mayan Farmers" by Maria Elena Martinez-Torres
3. "Soil Management for Sustainable Agriculture" - FAO Guidelines
4. "The Complete Guide to Coffee Cultivation" - Specialty Coffee Association
5. Online course: "Sustainable Coffee Production" - edX platform

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited access to soil testing equipment
   - Solution: Prepare visual aids showing soil test results and interpretation. Demonstrate alternative, low-tech soil assessment methods (e.g., jar test for soil composition).

2. Challenge: Students unfamiliar with scientific terms
   - Solution: Use local language equivalents where possible. Create a visual glossary with pictures representing each term.

3. Challenge: Difficulty visualizing agroforestry systems
   - Solution: Use 3D models or arrange a field trip to a local agroforestry coffee farm. If not possible, use detailed photos or virtual tours of agroforestry systems.

4. Challenge: Resistance to changing traditional practices
   - Solution: Emphasize how sustainable practices can complement traditional methods. Share success stories from other Timorese farmers who have adopted these practices.

5. Challenge: Limited materials for composting demonstration
   - Solution: Prepare a "compost ingredients kit" in advance with locally available materials. Provide a take-home guide for students to create compost on their own farms.

6. Challenge: Varying levels of literacy among students
   - Solution: Use more visual aids and hands-on activities. Pair students with different literacy levels for group work to encourage peer learning.
