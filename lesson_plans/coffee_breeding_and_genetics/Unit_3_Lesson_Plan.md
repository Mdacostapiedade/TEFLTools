# Lesson Plan: Coffee Plant Health and Disease Management

## Resources Needed
- Samples of diseased coffee leaves and berries
- Magnifying glasses
- Microscopes (if available)
- Local organic materials for pesticide preparation (neem leaves, garlic, chili peppers)
- Spray bottles
- Protective gear (gloves, masks)
- Handouts with disease identification guides
- Posters of the coffee plant lifecycle and common pests

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify common coffee diseases in Timor-Leste, particularly coffee leaf rust and coffee berry borer
2. Understand the principles of integrated pest management (IPM)
3. Prepare simple organic pesticides using locally available materials
4. Conduct a basic field diagnosis of plant diseases

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Show students pictures of healthy and diseased coffee plants
- Ask them to identify differences and discuss what might cause these changes

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)
Introduce and explain key terms:
- Coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix)
- Coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei)
- Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
- Biological control
- Cultural control
- Chemical control

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)
1. Coffee Leaf Rust
   - Symptoms and identification
   - Life cycle of the fungus
   - Environmental conditions favoring the disease
   - Impact on coffee production

2. Coffee Berry Borer
   - Identification of the pest
   - Life cycle and behavior
   - Damage to coffee cherries
   - Economic impact

3. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies
   - Definition and principles of IPM
   - Cultural control methods (pruning, shade management, sanitation)
   - Biological control options
   - Chemical control as a last resort
   - Importance of monitoring and early detection

4. Organic Pest Control Methods
   - Benefits of organic methods
   - Local materials that can be used (neem, garlic, chili)
   - Basic formulations for organic pesticides

## Practice Activities (60 minutes)
1. Disease Identification Exercise (30 minutes)
   - Divide students into small groups
   - Provide each group with samples of diseased leaves and berries
   - Have them use magnifying glasses to observe and identify diseases based on symptoms
   - Groups present their findings to the class

2. Organic Pesticide Preparation (30 minutes)
   - Demonstrate the preparation of a simple neem-based pesticide
   - Guide students in preparing their own organic pesticide using local materials
   - Discuss proper application methods and safety precautions

## Production Task (45 minutes)
Field Diagnosis Activity:
- Take students to a nearby coffee plot
- Divide them into teams and assign each team a section of the plot
- Have teams conduct a field survey, identifying and recording any signs of disease or pest infestation
- Teams should propose management strategies based on their findings
- Conclude with a group discussion of observations and recommendations

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Conduct a quick quiz on disease identification and IPM principles
- Address any remaining questions from students

## Homework Assignment
1. Research one additional coffee pest or disease not covered in class and prepare a one-page report on its symptoms, impact, and management strategies.
2. Design an IPM plan for a small coffee farm, incorporating at least three different control methods.

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Coffee Leaf Rust: A fungal disease caused by Hemileia vastatrix that produces orange-yellow powdery lesions on the underside of coffee leaves.
- Coffee Berry Borer: A small beetle (Hypothenemus hampei) that bores into coffee cherries, causing significant damage to the beans.
- Integrated Pest Management (IPM): An ecosystem-based approach to crop protection that combines different management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and minimize the use of pesticides.
- Biological Control: The use of living organisms to suppress pest populations.
- Cultural Control: Pest management practices that make the environment less favorable to pests, such as crop rotation or pruning.
- Chemical Control: The use of synthetic or natural chemical substances to kill or inhibit pests.
