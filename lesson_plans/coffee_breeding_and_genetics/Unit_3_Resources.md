# Lecture Notes

## Coffee Leaf Rust

### Introduction
- Coffee leaf rust (CLR) is caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix
- One of the most devastating coffee diseases worldwide
- First reported in Timor-Leste in 1990s

### Symptoms and Identification
- Orange-yellow powdery spots on the underside of leaves
- Corresponding yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface
- Advanced stages: leaves turn brown and fall off
- Severe infections can cause defoliation and die-back of branches

### Life Cycle
1. Spores land on coffee leaves
2. Germination occurs under favorable conditions (moisture, temperature)
3. Fungus penetrates leaf through stomata
4. Mycelium grows inside leaf tissue
5. New spores produced and released through stomata
6. Cycle repeats

### Environmental Conditions
- Optimal temperature: 21-25°C (70-77°F)
- High humidity (>80%) or leaf wetness
- Shade and poor air circulation exacerbate the problem

### Impact on Coffee Production
- Reduced photosynthesis due to leaf damage
- Decreased yield (up to 50% in severe cases)
- Weakened plants more susceptible to other stresses
- Long-term economic impact on farmers and industry

## Coffee Berry Borer

### Introduction
- Scientific name: Hypothenemus hampei
- Considered the most harmful insect pest in coffee production
- Native to Africa but now found in most coffee-growing regions

### Identification
- Adult beetle: 1.5-2 mm long, dark brown to black
- Females larger than males
- Larvae: white, legless grubs found inside coffee cherries

### Life Cycle and Behavior
1. Female bores into coffee cherry through the blossom end
2. Lays eggs inside the coffee bean
3. Larvae feed on the bean, creating tunnels
4. Pupation occurs inside the bean
5. New adults emerge and may remain in the same cherry or exit to infest others

### Damage to Coffee Cherries
- Tunneling reduces bean quality and weight
- Entry holes allow secondary infections by fungi and bacteria
- Premature fall of cherries
- Increased percentage of defective beans

### Economic Impact
- Yield losses of 30-35% are common in heavily infested areas
- Quality degradation leads to lower prices for farmers
- Increased production costs due to control measures

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies

### Definition and Principles
- Ecosystem-based approach to pest management
- Combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools
- Aims to minimize economic, health, and environmental risks
- Four main components: Prevention, Monitoring, Control, Evaluation

### Cultural Control Methods
- Pruning to improve air circulation and reduce humidity
- Proper shade management
- Regular harvesting to remove potential host material
- Sanitation: removing fallen cherries and infected plant parts

### Biological Control Options
- Encouraging natural predators (e.g., birds, ants)
- Use of entomopathogenic fungi (e.g., Beauveria bassiana)
- Release of parasitoid wasps for coffee berry borer control

### Chemical Control
- Used as a last resort in IPM
- Selection of appropriate fungicides or insecticides
- Proper timing and application methods
- Consideration of environmental impact and resistance management

### Importance of Monitoring and Early Detection
- Regular field scouting
- Use of traps for insect pests
- Maintaining detailed records of pest populations and control measures
- Adjusting management strategies based on monitoring data

## Organic Pest Control Methods

### Benefits of Organic Methods
- Reduced environmental impact
- Preservation of beneficial insects and soil microorganisms
- Lower input costs for farmers
- Potential for premium prices for organic certified coffee

### Local Materials for Organic Pesticides
- Neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves and seeds
- Garlic (Allium sativum)
- Chili peppers (Capsicum spp.)
- Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves
- Pyrethrum flowers (Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium)

### Basic Formulations for Organic Pesticides
1. Neem-based spray:
   - Soak 500g neem leaves in 2L water overnight
   - Strain and dilute with 8L water
   - Add 20g of soap as a sticker
   - Spray on affected plants every 7-10 days

2. Garlic-chili spray:
   - Blend 100g garlic and 100g hot chilies
   - Soak in 1L water for 24 hours
   - Strain and dilute with 5L water
   - Add 10g of soap
   - Apply weekly as a repellent

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the coffee leaf rust fungus spread, and what environmental conditions favor its development?

2. Discuss the potential long-term impacts of coffee berry borer infestation on a small-scale coffee farm in Timor-Leste.

3. Compare and contrast the effectiveness of cultural control methods versus chemical control in managing coffee pests and diseases.

4. How might climate change affect the prevalence and severity of coffee leaf rust in Timor-Leste?

5. What are the potential challenges and benefits of implementing a fully organic pest management system on a coffee farm?

6. How can farmers balance the need for immediate pest control with long-term sustainability goals?

7. Discuss the role of community cooperation in implementing effective IPM strategies across multiple small farms.

8. How might traditional Timorese agricultural practices be integrated with modern IPM approaches?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. Develop an integrated pest management plan for a small coffee farm in Timor-Leste, addressing both coffee leaf rust and coffee berry borer. Include specific strategies for prevention, monitoring, and control.

2. Compare the potential economic and environmental impacts of conventional chemical pest control versus organic methods in coffee production. Consider both short-term and long-term effects on farm sustainability.

3. Analyze the challenges and opportunities for implementing a community-wide pest management program in a coffee-growing region of Timor-Leste. Discuss potential barriers and strategies for overcoming them.

# Assignment Details

## Field Diagnosis Report

1. Conduct a field survey of a local coffee plot (minimum 20 trees).
2. Record observations of plant health, signs of disease or pest infestation.
3. Identify at least three specific issues affecting the plot.
4. For each issue identified:
   - Describe the symptoms observed
   - Propose a diagnosis
   - Suggest appropriate management strategies
5. Create a simple map of the plot showing the distribution of observed issues.

## Organic Pesticide Preparation and Testing

1. Form groups of 3-4 students.
2. Each group will:
   - Choose one organic pesticide recipe from the class demonstration or research an alternative
   - Prepare the chosen pesticide using locally available materials
   - Design a simple experiment to test its effectiveness (e.g., on potted plants or a small plot)
   - Implement the experiment over a 2-week period, recording observations
   - Present results to the class in a 10-minute presentation, including:
     * Recipe and preparation method
     * Experimental design

     * Conclusions on effectiveness
     * Suggestions for improvement or further testing
