Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Coffee Plant Health and Disease Management, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Coffee Plant Health and Disease Management Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Coffee Leaf Rust (Hemileia vastatrix)**: A fungal disease that produces orange-yellow powdery lesions on the underside of coffee leaves, leading to defoliation and reduced yield.
- **Coffee Berry Borer (Hypothenemus hampei)**: A small beetle that bores into coffee cherries, causing significant damage to the beans and reducing quality and yield.
- **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**: An ecosystem-based approach to crop protection that combines different management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and minimize the use of pesticides.
- **Biological Control**: The use of living organisms to suppress pest populations.
- **Cultural Control**: Pest management practices that make the environment less favorable to pests, such as crop rotation or pruning.
- **Chemical Control**: The use of synthetic or natural chemical substances to kill or inhibit pests.
- **Neem**: A tree native to India, whose leaves and seeds are used to make natural pesticides.
- **Sanitation**: The practice of removing diseased plant material and debris to reduce the spread of pests and diseases.
- **Pruning**: The selective removal of plant parts to improve plant health, productivity, and structure.
- **Shade Management**: Controlling the amount of shade in a coffee plantation to create optimal growing conditions and reduce pest and disease pressure.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Coffee Leaf Rust Lifecycle Diagram**: A circular diagram showing the stages of coffee leaf rust development, from spore germination to lesion formation and spore dispersal.

2. **Coffee Berry Borer Identification Poster**: An illustrated poster showing the coffee berry borer at different life stages (egg, larva, pupa, adult) and the damage it causes to coffee cherries.

3. **IPM Triangle**: A triangle diagram illustrating the three main components of IPM: cultural control, biological control, and chemical control, with examples of each.

4. **Organic Pesticide Ingredients Chart**: A visual chart displaying common local ingredients used in organic pesticides (neem leaves, garlic, chili peppers) along with their pest-control properties.

5. **Field Diagnosis Checklist**: A visual checklist for students to use during field diagnosis, including symptoms to look for on leaves, stems, and berries.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Disease Identification Guide**: A two-page handout with photos and descriptions of common coffee diseases in Timor-Leste, including coffee leaf rust, coffee berry disease, and root rot.

2. **IPM Strategy Planner**: A worksheet where students can plan an IPM strategy for a hypothetical coffee farm, listing cultural, biological, and chemical control methods they would implement.

3. **Organic Pesticide Recipe Card**: A card with step-by-step instructions for preparing a neem-based organic pesticide, including ingredients, measurements, and application guidelines.

4. **Field Survey Form**: A form for students to use during the field diagnosis activity, with spaces to record observations on plant health, disease symptoms, and pest presence.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Integrated Pest Management for Coffee Production: A Practical Guide" by the International Coffee Organization
2. "Coffee Pests, Diseases and Their Management" by J.M. Waller, M. Bigger, and R.J. Hillocks
3. World Coffee Research's Arabica Coffee Varieties catalog (https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/)
4. Online course: "Sustainable Coffee Production" by edX and UTZ Certified
5. Mobile app: "Coffee Pest and Disease Identifier" by CABI

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Limited access to microscopes**: If microscopes are not available, use high-quality magnifying glasses and printed close-up images of pests and disease symptoms.

2. **Varying levels of prior knowledge**: Conduct a quick pre-assessment and group students with mixed experience levels to encourage peer learning.

3. **Language barriers**: Prepare visual aids with both local language and scientific terms. Use local names for pests and diseases alongside scientific names.

4. **Safety concerns with pesticide preparation**: Emphasize safety precautions, provide protective gear, and closely supervise the organic pesticide preparation activity.

5. **Limited field access**: If a coffee plot is not accessible, create a mock field setup using potted coffee plants or use virtual field trip resources.

6. **Time management**: Prepare materials in advance and have a flexible schedule to allow for extended discussions or activities if needed.

7. **Engaging students with different learning styles**: Incorporate a mix of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic activities to cater to diverse learning preferences.

8. **Connecting theory to local practices**: Encourage students to share their own experiences and traditional knowledge, integrating it with scientific information presented in the lesson.
