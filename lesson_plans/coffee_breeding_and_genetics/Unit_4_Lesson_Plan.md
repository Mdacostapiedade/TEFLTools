# Lesson Plan: Climate-Smart Coffee Production

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on climate change effects on coffee
- Materials for designing climate-resilient coffee plots (large paper, markers, etc.)
- Local climate data charts and graphs
- Samples of drought-resistant coffee varieties (if available)
- Water conservation equipment examples (drip irrigation, mulch, etc.)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the impacts of climate change on coffee production in Timor-Leste
- Identify at least three drought-resistant farming techniques
- Describe two water conservation methods suitable for coffee farms
- Design a basic climate-resilient coffee plot

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to share any changes they've noticed in local weather patterns over the past few years
- Record observations on the whiteboard, grouping similar responses

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Climate change
- Drought resistance
- Water conservation
- Resilience
- Adaptation

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Climate Change Effects on Coffee in Timor-Leste
- Present local climate data showing temperature and rainfall changes
- Discuss potential impacts on coffee flowering, fruit development, and overall yield
- Highlight specific challenges for Timorese coffee farmers

### Drought-Resistant Farming Techniques
- Introduce drought-tolerant coffee varieties
- Explain shade management for temperature control
- Discuss mulching techniques to retain soil moisture

### Water Conservation Methods
- Present drip irrigation systems
- Explain rainwater harvesting techniques
- Discuss proper pruning for water efficiency

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Divide class into small groups
- Each group analyzes a case study of a Timorese coffee farm facing climate challenges
- Groups identify potential adaptation strategies based on the lesson content

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

- Students work in pairs to design a climate-resilient coffee plot
- Designs should include:
  * Layout of coffee plants and shade trees
  * Water conservation methods
  * Soil management techniques
- Each pair presents their design to the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Facilitate a class discussion on the most promising climate-smart techniques for Timor-Leste
- Review key points from the lesson
- Address any remaining questions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students interview an elder in their community about observed climate changes over their lifetime
- Write a 1-page reflection on how these changes might affect local coffee production

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Climate change: Long-term alterations in temperature and weather patterns
- Drought resistance: The ability of plants to withstand periods of limited water availability
- Water conservation: Practices that reduce water usage and increase efficiency
- Resilience: The capacity to recover quickly from difficulties
- Adaptation: The process of changing to better suit a new environment or conditions
