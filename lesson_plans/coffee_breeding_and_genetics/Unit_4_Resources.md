## Climate Change Effects on Coffee in Timor-Leste

### Introduction
- Timor-Leste's coffee industry is vulnerable to climate change
- Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns affect coffee production

### Temperature Changes
- Average temperatures in Timor-Leste have increased by 1°C since 1960
- Projections suggest a further increase of 1.5-2.5°C by 2050
- Impact on coffee:
  * Altered flowering patterns
  * Faster ripening, potentially reducing quality
  * Increased pest and disease pressure

### Rainfall Patterns
- Rainfall becoming more erratic and intense
- Dry seasons becoming longer and more severe
- Impact on coffee:
  * Water stress during critical growth stages
  * Increased erosion risk
  * Potential for landslides in mountainous coffee regions

### Specific Challenges for Timorese Coffee Farmers
- Limited access to irrigation infrastructure
- Reliance on traditional farming methods
- High altitude farms may become too warm for quality Arabica production
- Potential shift in suitable growing areas, affecting traditional coffee communities

## Drought-Resistant Farming Techniques

### Drought-Tolerant Coffee Varieties
- Timor Hybrid: naturally more resistant to drought
- Sarchimor: good drought tolerance and disease resistance
- Catimor: adapts well to various climatic conditions

### Shade Management
- Benefits of shade trees:
  * Reduce temperature extremes
  * Improve soil moisture retention
  * Provide additional income (fruit trees, timber)
- Recommended shade levels: 30-50% for Arabica in Timor-Leste
- Native shade tree species: Ai-dak, Ai-kafe, Mahogany

### Mulching Techniques
- Organic mulch materials:
  * Coffee pulp
  * Leaf litter
  * Rice husks
- Benefits of mulching:
  * Reduces soil evaporation
  * Suppresses weed growth
  * Adds organic matter to soil
- Application: 5-10 cm layer around coffee plants, avoiding direct contact with stem

## Water Conservation Methods

### Drip Irrigation Systems
- Components:
  * Water source (tank or reservoir)
  * Main line
  * Sub-main lines
  * Drippers or emitters
- Benefits:
  * Water efficiency (up to 90% compared to flood irrigation)
  * Reduced labor costs
  * Precise water application

### Rainwater Harvesting
- Methods:
  * Rooftop collection systems
  * Contour trenches on hillsides
  * Small check dams in seasonal streams
- Storage options:
  * Underground tanks
  * Above-ground reservoirs
  * Farm ponds

### Pruning for Water Efficiency
- Proper pruning reduces water demand
- Techniques:
  * Selective pruning to remove unproductive branches
  * Topping to control tree height
  * Rejuvenation pruning for old trees
- Timing: best done after harvest, before the rainy season

# Discussion Questions

1. How have you personally observed climate change affecting coffee production in your area?
2. What are the potential long-term consequences of climate change for Timor-Leste's coffee industry if no adaptation measures are taken?
3. Which drought-resistant farming technique do you think would be most effective and feasible for small-scale farmers in Timor-Leste? Why?
4. How might the implementation of water conservation methods impact the daily routines of coffee farmers?
5. What cultural or traditional practices in Timorese coffee farming might need to be adapted in response to climate change?
6. How can the government and NGOs support coffee farmers in transitioning to climate-smart production methods?
7. What are the potential economic impacts of shifting to more climate-resilient coffee production practices?
8. How might climate change affect the flavor profile and quality of Timorese coffee, and what implications could this have for the market?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Climate Change Adaptation Plan

Write a 2-3 page climate change adaptation plan for a hypothetical coffee farm in Timor-Leste. Your plan should include:

1. A brief description of the farm (location, size, current practices)
2. Identification of key climate-related risks facing the farm
3. At least three specific adaptation strategies, including:
   - Description of the strategy
   - Implementation steps
   - Potential challenges and how to overcome them
4. A timeline for implementing the strategies over the next 5 years
5. A brief conclusion discussing the expected outcomes of the adaptation plan

Use the information from the lectures and your own research to support your plan. Be sure to consider the unique context of coffee farming in Timor-Leste.

# Assignment Details

## Community Climate Change Interview and Reflection

### Objective
To connect classroom learning with local knowledge and experiences of climate change.

### Instructions
1. Interview an elder (50 years or older) in your community about their observations of climate change over their lifetime. Ask questions such as:
   - How has the weather changed since you were young?
   - Have you noticed any changes in when the rainy season starts or ends?
   - How have these changes affected farming practices?
   - What traditional methods did farmers use to predict weather, and do these still work?

2. Write a 1-page reflection (300-400 words) addressing the following points:
   - Summarize the key observations from your interview
   - Compare these observations with the scientific data presented in class
   - Discuss how the observed changes might affect local coffee production
   - Suggest one or two adaptation strategies that could help address the challenges identified

### Submission
- Due date: [Insert appropriate date]
- Format: Double-spaced, 12-point font
- Submit both the interview notes and your reflection

### Grading Criteria
- Depth and relevance of interview questions (20%)
- Quality of reflection and analysis (40%)
- Connection to course material (20%)
- Writing clarity and organization (20%)
