# Support Material for Climate-Smart Coffee Production Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Climate change**: Long-term alterations in temperature and weather patterns
- **Drought resistance**: The ability of plants to withstand periods of limited water availability
- **Water conservation**: Practices that reduce water usage and increase efficiency
- **Resilience**: The capacity to recover quickly from difficulties
- **Adaptation**: The process of changing to better suit a new environment or conditions
- **Agroforestry**: A land use management system where trees or shrubs are grown around crops
- **Mulching**: Covering the soil surface with organic material to retain moisture and suppress weeds
- **Drip irrigation**: A method of irrigation that saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants
- **Shade management**: The practice of controlling the amount of shade provided to coffee plants by other trees
- **Rainwater harvesting**: The collection and storage of rainwater for reuse

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Climate Change Impact Diagram**: A flowchart showing how increased temperatures and irregular rainfall affect coffee plant growth stages, from flowering to bean development.

2. **Drought-Resistant Coffee Plot Layout**: An overhead view diagram of an ideal climate-resilient coffee plot, including:
   - Rows of coffee plants with appropriate spacing
   - Shade trees strategically placed
   - Mulched areas around plants
   - Drip irrigation system layout
   - Contour lines for sloped terrain

3. **Water Conservation Methods Infographic**: Visual representations of:
   - Drip irrigation system components
   - Rainwater harvesting setup with storage tank
   - Proper pruning techniques for water efficiency

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Climate Change Effects on Coffee Production**: A table listing common climate change phenomena and their specific impacts on coffee plants in Timor-Leste.

2. **Drought-Resistant Techniques Checklist**: A list of techniques with checkboxes for students to assess their understanding and potential implementation.

3. **Water Conservation Methods Comparison**: A worksheet where students compare different water conservation methods, listing pros and cons for each in the context of Timorese coffee farms.

4. **Climate-Resilient Coffee Plot Design Template**: A blank template with guidelines for students to design their own climate-smart coffee plot during the production task.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have varying levels of prior knowledge about climate change.
   **Solution**: Start with a brief assessment of students' understanding and adjust the depth of climate science explanations accordingly.

2. **Challenge**: Some students might be skeptical about climate change impacts.
   **Solution**: Use local data and examples, and encourage students to share their own observations of weather pattern changes.

3. **Challenge**: Implementing new techniques may seem overwhelming to traditional farmers.
   **Solution**: Emphasize gradual adoption and highlight success stories from other Timorese farmers who have implemented these methods.

4. **Challenge**: Limited access to some of the suggested equipment (e.g., drip irrigation systems).
   **Solution**: Discuss low-tech alternatives and improvised solutions using locally available materials.

5. **Challenge**: Difficulty in visualizing long-term climate impacts.
   **Solution**: Use simulations or time-lapse videos if available, or create role-playing scenarios where students act out future climate scenarios.

6. **Challenge**: Connecting abstract climate concepts to practical farming decisions.
   **Solution**: Use case studies of real Timorese farms and encourage students to relate the information to their own experiences or family farms.
