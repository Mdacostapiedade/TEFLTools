# Lesson Plan: Harvesting and Post-Harvest Processing

## 1. Resources Needed

- Samples of coffee cherries at different stages of ripeness
- Harvesting baskets
- Wet processing equipment (pulper, fermentation tanks, washing channels)
- Drying tables or patios
- Visual aids (posters or slides) showing wet and dry processing methods
- Handouts on harvesting best practices and processing steps
- Coffee Processing Manual for Timor-Leste

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify ripe coffee cherries for selective harvesting
- Explain the steps involved in wet processing of coffee
- Describe proper sun-drying techniques for coffee beans
- Understand the impact of harvesting and processing on coffee quality

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display various coffee cherries (unripe, ripe, overripe) and ask students to sort them into groups.
- Discuss why proper selection is crucial for coffee quality.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Selective harvesting
- Pulping
- Fermentation
- Mucilage
- Parchment coffee
- Wet processing
- Dry processing

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Selective Harvesting
- Importance of picking only ripe cherries
- Techniques for identifying ripe cherries
- Frequency of harvesting passes

### Wet Processing Method
- Pulping: removing the cherry skin and pulp
- Fermentation: breaking down mucilage
- Washing: removing fermented mucilage
- Drying: reducing moisture content to 11-12%

### Sun-Drying Techniques
- Proper drying surface preparation
- Thickness of coffee layer
- Frequency of turning
- Protection from rain and dew
- Achieving proper moisture content

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

- Cherry selection exercise: Students practice identifying and picking ripe cherries from sample branches.
- Wet processing simulation: Walk through each step of the wet processing method using available equipment.

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Divide class into groups to perform different stages of wet processing:
  * Group 1: Pulping cherries
  * Group 2: Monitoring fermentation
  * Group 3: Washing parchment coffee
  * Group 4: Preparing drying beds and spreading coffee

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick quiz on processing steps and their importance
- Group discussion on how proper harvesting and processing affect coffee quality

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students to observe and document (through notes or photos) any coffee processing activities in their community.
- Read the relevant chapter in the Coffee Processing Manual for Timor-Leste.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Selective harvesting: The practice of picking only ripe coffee cherries during harvest.
- Pulping: The process of removing the outer skin and pulp from coffee cherries.
- Fermentation: The breakdown of mucilage surrounding coffee beans through natural enzymes or microorganisms.
- Mucilage: The slimy layer surrounding coffee beans inside the cherry.
- Parchment coffee: Coffee beans still encased in their papery endocarp after pulping and fermentation.
- Wet processing: A method of coffee processing involving removal of the cherry pulp before drying the beans.
- Dry processing: A method where whole coffee cherries are dried before the beans are removed.
