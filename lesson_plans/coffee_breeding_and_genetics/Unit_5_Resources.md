# Lecture Notes

## Selective Harvesting

### Importance of Ripe Cherry Selection
- Ripe cherries contain fully developed sugars and acids
- Unripe or overripe cherries negatively impact flavor
- Consistent ripeness leads to more uniform fermentation and drying

### Identifying Ripe Cherries
- Color: Bright red for most varieties (some yellow when ripe)
- Firmness: Slight give when squeezed
- Easy removal from stem

### Harvesting Techniques
- Strip picking vs. selective picking
- Use of both hands for efficiency
- Proper container use to avoid damaging cherries

### Harvesting Frequency
- Ideal: Every 7-10 days during peak season
- Adjust based on ripening patterns and labor availability
- Multiple passes ensure optimal ripeness

## Wet Processing Method

### Pulping
- Purpose: Remove cherry skin and pulp
- Timing: Within 24 hours of harvesting
- Equipment: Manual or motorized pulpers
- Calibration importance for minimal damage to beans

### Fermentation
- Purpose: Break down remaining mucilage
- Methods: Dry fermentation vs. wet fermentation
- Duration: Typically 12-36 hours, depending on climate
- Monitoring: Regular checking for completion (slippery feel gone)

### Washing
- Purpose: Remove fermented mucilage and stop fermentation
- Technique: Use of washing channels or tanks
- Water quality: Clean, free from contaminants
- Grading: Opportunity to separate floaters (lower quality)

### Drying
- Target moisture content: 11-12%
- Initial rapid drying to prevent mold growth
- Slower drying to ensure even moisture throughout bean

## Sun-Drying Techniques

### Drying Surface Preparation
- Raised beds: Better airflow, less risk of contamination
- Concrete patios: Ensure cleanliness, no cracks
- Avoid direct ground contact

### Coffee Layer Thickness
- Initial spread: 1-2 cm thick
- Gradual increase to 4-5 cm as drying progresses

### Turning Frequency
- Every 30-45 minutes in early stages
- Reduce to every 2-3 hours as drying progresses
- Ensure even drying and prevent mold growth

### Protection Measures
- Use of covers during rain or overnight
- Importance of airflow even when covered

### Moisture Content Monitoring
- Use of moisture meters
- Hand-feel method for experienced processors
- Importance of not over-drying (makes beans brittle)

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the ripeness of coffee cherries at harvest affect the final cup quality?
2. Compare and contrast wet processing and dry processing methods. What are the advantages and challenges of each in the Timorese context?
3. Why is fermentation an important step in wet processing? How can a farmer determine when fermentation is complete?
4. What are the main challenges in sun-drying coffee in Timor-Leste's climate, and how can these be addressed?
5. How might climate change impact harvesting and processing practices in Timor-Leste, and what adaptations might be necessary?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a step-by-step guide for a new coffee farmer in Timor-Leste on how to properly harvest and wet process their coffee. Include specific details relevant to the local context, such as typical harvesting seasons, common equipment available, and traditional practices that align with modern quality standards. Your guide should be clear, concise, and easy to follow.

# Assignment Details

## Field Observation and Report

1. Visit a local coffee farm or processing center during harvesting or processing activities.
2. Observe and document the following:
   - Harvesting methods used
   - Ripeness selection criteria
   - Processing equipment and facilities
   - Fermentation and washing practices
   - Drying methods and duration
3. Interview at least one farmer or processor about their practices and challenges.
4. Prepare a 2-3 page report comparing the observed practices with those discussed in class. Include:
   - Description of observed methods
   - Analysis of alignment with best practices
   - Identification of areas for potential improvement
   - Recommendations considering local constraints and resources

Due date: One week from today's class

# Additional Materials

## Moisture Content Chart

| Moisture % | Bean Characteristics | Suitability for Storage |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| >12%       | Soft, high risk of mold | Not suitable |
| 11-12%     | Slightly soft, ideal range | Excellent |
| 10-11%     | Hard, slight risk of quality loss | Good |
| <10%       | Very hard, brittle | Risk of flavor loss |

## Common Defects from Improper Processing

1. Ferment taste: Over-fermentation during wet processing
2. Phenol taste: Interrupted drying allowing mold growth
3. Faded appearance: Over-exposure to sunlight during drying
4. Black beans: Cherries harvested overripe or fallen to ground

## Local Case Study: Cooperativa CafÃ© Timor (CCT)

Brief overview of CCT's successful implementation of quality control measures in harvesting and processing, leading to improved market access and higher prices for farmers. Include their specific adaptations to Timorese conditions and how they've trained farmers in best practices.
