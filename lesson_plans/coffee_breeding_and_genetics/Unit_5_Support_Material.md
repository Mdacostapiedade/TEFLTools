# Support Material for Harvesting and Post-Harvest Processing Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Selective harvesting**: The practice of picking only ripe coffee cherries during harvest.
- **Pulping**: The process of removing the outer skin and pulp from coffee cherries.
- **Fermentation**: The breakdown of mucilage surrounding coffee beans through natural enzymes or microorganisms.
- **Mucilage**: The slimy layer surrounding coffee beans inside the cherry.
- **Parchment coffee**: Coffee beans still encased in their papery endocarp after pulping and fermentation.
- **Wet processing**: A method of coffee processing involving removal of the cherry pulp before drying the beans.
- **Dry processing**: A method where whole coffee cherries are dried before the beans are removed.
- **Brix meter**: A tool used to measure the sugar content in coffee cherries to determine ripeness.
- **Flotation**: A method to separate lower quality coffee beans by placing them in water; defective beans float.
- **Cupping**: The practice of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffee to evaluate its quality.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Coffee Cherry Ripeness Chart**: 
   A color-coded diagram showing coffee cherries at different stages of ripeness, from green (unripe) to deep red or purple (overripe). Each stage is labeled with its characteristics and suitability for harvesting.

2. **Wet Processing Flow Chart**:
   A step-by-step diagram illustrating the wet processing method, including:
   - Harvesting
   - Pulping
   - Fermentation
   - Washing
   - Drying
   Each step is accompanied by a small illustration and brief description.

3. **Sun-Drying Best Practices Poster**:
   A visual guide showing proper sun-drying techniques, including:
   - Correct coffee layer thickness
   - Proper turning frequency
   - Protection methods from rain and dew
   - Visual cues for determining proper moisture content

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Harvesting Checklist**:
   A one-page checklist for students to use during harvesting practice, including:
   - Visual indicators of ripe cherries
   - Proper picking technique
   - Container cleanliness
   - Sorting guidelines

2. **Wet Processing Log Sheet**:
   A form for students to record details during the wet processing simulation, including:
   - Pulping start and end times
   - Fermentation duration and observations
   - Washing water quality
   - Initial and final moisture content during drying

3. **Coffee Processing Comparison Worksheet**:
   A table comparing wet and dry processing methods, with columns for students to fill in:
   - Equipment needed
   - Processing steps
   - Time required
   - Effect on flavor profile
   - Advantages and disadvantages

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Coffee: Growing, Processing, Sustainable Production" by Jean Nicolas Wintgens
2. Specialty Coffee Association's "The Coffee Roaster's Companion" by Scott Rao
3. World Coffee Research's "Harvesting & Post-harvest Processing" online module
4. Coffee Quality Institute's "Processing" course materials
5. Local agricultural extension service publications on coffee processing in Timor-Leste

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to identify ripe cherries consistently.
   **Solution**: Provide additional practice with a wider variety of coffee cherry samples. Use a Brix meter to demonstrate objective ripeness measurement.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to wet processing equipment for all students.
   **Solution**: Organize rotating small groups for hands-on practice. Use video demonstrations and simulations for larger groups.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty in explaining fermentation process.
   **Solution**: Use visual aids like time-lapse videos or microscope observations of fermenting mucilage. Conduct simple fermentation experiments with different variables.

4. **Challenge**: Maintaining student engagement during drying process explanation.
   **Solution**: Incorporate interactive moisture content testing activities. Use case studies of quality issues resulting from improper drying.

5. **Challenge**: Connecting processing methods to cup quality.
   **Solution**: If possible, arrange a basic cupping session comparing coffees processed differently. Use flavor wheel activities to describe theoretical taste differences.
