# Lesson Plan: Quality Control and Cupping

## 1. Resources Needed

- Green coffee samples of varying qualities
- Roasted coffee samples
- Cupping equipment (cups, spoons, hot water source, grinder)
- SCA Flavor Wheel posters
- Green coffee grading handbook
- Roasting log sheets
- Cupping forms
- Whiteboard and markers

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify and grade green coffee beans based on physical defects
- Understand basic roasting profiles and their impact on flavor
- Perform a standard coffee cupping protocol
- Describe coffee flavors using industry-standard terminology

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Blind aroma test: Present 5 covered cups with different aromatic substances (e.g., cinnamon, lemon peel, cocoa powder, vanilla, fresh coffee grounds)
- Students smell each and write down what they think it is
- Discuss results and introduce the importance of sensory skills in coffee quality assessment

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Green coffee grading
- Screen size
- Primary defects
- Secondary defects
- Roast profile
- First crack
- Cupping
- Flavor attributes (acidity, body, sweetness, etc.)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Green Coffee Grading (15 minutes)
- Explain the importance of green coffee grading
- Demonstrate the use of screens for size grading
- Show examples of primary and secondary defects
- Explain how defects impact cup quality

### Roasting Basics (15 minutes)
- Discuss the basic stages of coffee roasting
- Explain how roast profiles affect flavor development
- Show examples of light, medium, and dark roasts

### Cupping Protocols (15 minutes)
- Introduce the standard cupping protocol (SCA method)
- Explain each step: dry fragrance, wet aroma, breaking the crust, tasting
- Demonstrate proper cupping techniques and etiquette

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

### Green Coffee Grading Exercise (20 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a 350g sample of green coffee
- Students grade the coffee using provided grading sheets
- Compare and discuss results

### Cupping Session (40 minutes)
- Set up a cupping table with 3-4 different coffees
- Guide students through the cupping process step-by-step
- Encourage students to take notes on flavor, aroma, and body
- Facilitate a group discussion on findings

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

### Flavor Profile Creation
- Students work in pairs to create a detailed flavor profile for one of the cupped coffees
- Use the SCA Flavor Wheel to identify and describe flavors
- Present findings to the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points of green coffee grading, roasting, and cupping
- Address any questions or misconceptions
- Highlight the importance of quality control in improving Timorese coffee

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 1-page report on a specific coffee defect, its causes, and prevention methods
- Practice describing everyday food and drink items using sensory vocabulary

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Green coffee grading: The process of evaluating unroasted coffee beans for size, shape, and defects
- Screen size: A measurement used to grade coffee beans by size using screens with different sized holes
- Primary defects: Major imperfections in coffee beans that significantly impact quality (e.g., full black beans, sour beans)
- Secondary defects: Minor imperfections in coffee beans with less impact on quality (e.g., broken beans, slight insect damage)
- Roast profile: The time and temperature progression during the coffee roasting process
- First crack: The point during roasting when coffee beans emit an audible crack, indicating the beginning of flavor development
- Cupping: A standardized method of evaluating coffee flavor by steeping ground coffee in hot water and tasting the resulting brew
- Flavor attributes: Characteristics used to describe coffee taste, including acidity, body, sweetness, and specific flavor notes
