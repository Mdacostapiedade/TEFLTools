## Green Coffee Grading

### Introduction to Green Coffee Grading
- Definition: Process of evaluating unroasted coffee beans for quality
- Importance: Determines coffee value, influences roasting decisions

### Grading Criteria
1. Size
   - Use of screen sizes (e.g., 15, 16, 17, 18)
   - Importance of uniform size for even roasting
2. Shape
   - Ideal: Oval with central crease
   - Common shapes: Peaberry, elephant bean
3. Color
   - Desirable: Blue-green to greenish
   - Undesirable: Whitish, brownish, black
4. Odor
   - Fresh, clean smell ideal
   - Off-odors indicate defects or improper processing

### Defects
1. Primary Defects
   - Full black beans
   - Full sour beans
   - Fungus-damaged beans
   - Foreign matter
2. Secondary Defects
   - Partial black beans
   - Partial sour beans
   - Parchment
   - Floaters
   - Immature beans
   - Withered beans
   - Shells

### Grading Process
1. Take a 350g sample
2. Remove all defects
3. Weigh defects
4. Calculate percentage of defects
5. Determine grade based on defect count and type

## Roasting Basics

### Stages of Roasting
1. Drying Stage (0-3 minutes)
   - Beans turn from green to yellow
   - Water evaporation begins
2. Browning Stage (3-8 minutes)
   - Maillard reactions start
   - Beans turn light brown
3. First Crack (8-10 minutes)
   - Audible cracking sound
   - Marks beginning of light roast
4. Development Stage (10-12 minutes)
   - Flavors develop and intensify
   - Oils may appear on bean surface
5. Second Crack (12-15 minutes)
   - Lighter cracking sound
   - Marks beginning of dark roast

### Roast Profiles
1. Light Roast
   - Stopped at or just after first crack
   - Higher acidity, more origin flavors
2. Medium Roast
   - Stopped between first and second crack
   - Balanced flavor, some origin characteristics
3. Dark Roast
   - Stopped at or after second crack
   - Lower acidity, more roast flavors

### Factors Affecting Roast
- Time
- Temperature
- Air flow
- Drum speed (for drum roasters)
- Batch size

## Cupping Protocols

### SCA Cupping Standards
1. Sample Preparation
   - 8.25g coffee per 150ml water
   - Medium-coarse grind

2. Dry Fragrance
   - Smell the dry grounds
   - Note aromas

3. Wet Aroma
   - Add water (92-96°C)
   - Smell immediately after pouring

4. Breaking the Crust
   - After 3-5 minutes, break crust with spoon
   - Smell aromas released

5. Tasting
   - Wait until temperature reaches 70°C
   - Slurp coffee from spoon
   - Evaluate flavor, acidity, body, and aftertaste

6. Scoring
   - Use SCA Cupping Form
   - Score attributes on a scale of 6-10

### Cupping Etiquette
- Use clean spoons for each cup
- Rinse spoon between tastes
- Spit coffee into provided containers
- Avoid strong perfumes or odors
- Maintain quiet for concentration
