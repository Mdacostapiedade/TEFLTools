# Support Material for Quality Control and Cupping Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Green coffee grading**: The process of evaluating unroasted coffee beans for size, shape, and defects.
- **Screen size**: A measurement used to grade coffee beans by size using screens with different sized holes.
- **Primary defects**: Major imperfections in coffee beans that significantly impact quality (e.g., full black beans, sour beans).
- **Secondary defects**: Minor imperfections in coffee beans with less impact on quality (e.g., broken beans, slight insect damage).
- **Roast profile**: The time and temperature progression during the coffee roasting process.
- **First crack**: The point during roasting when coffee beans emit an audible crack, indicating the beginning of flavor development.
- **Cupping**: A standardized method of evaluating coffee flavor by steeping ground coffee in hot water and tasting the resulting brew.
- **Flavor attributes**: Characteristics used to describe coffee taste, including acidity, body, sweetness, and specific flavor notes.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Green Coffee Defects Chart**:
   - Description: A visual chart showing common primary and secondary defects in green coffee beans, with images and brief descriptions of each defect.

2. **Roast Color Spectrum**:
   - Description: A color gradient showing the progression of coffee bean color from light to dark roast, with labels for key stages (e.g., light, medium, dark).

3. **SCA Flavor Wheel**:
   - Description: A circular diagram showing the hierarchy of coffee flavors, from broad categories to specific taste descriptors.

4. **Cupping Table Setup Diagram**:
   - Description: An overhead view diagram of a properly set up cupping table, showing the arrangement of cups, spoons, and other necessary equipment.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Green Coffee Grading Sheet**:
   - Content: A table for recording bean size, primary defects, secondary defects, and overall grade. Include spaces for sample weight, screen size distribution, and comments.

2. **Cupping Form**:
   - Content: A standardized form for evaluating coffee during cupping. Include sections for fragrance/aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, uniformity, clean cup, sweetness, and overall score.

3. **Roast Profile Log**:
   - Content: A graph template for recording time and temperature during roasting. Include spaces to note first crack, development time, and total roast time.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to identify defects in green coffee.
   - Solution: Provide a reference set of common defects for comparison and practice grading with pre-sorted samples before moving to unsorted beans.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in describing coffee flavors during cupping.
   - Solution: Start with familiar flavors and aromas before introducing more complex descriptors. Use aroma kits or common food items to help students connect flavors to words.

3. **Challenge**: Maintaining consistency in cupping evaluations across students.
   - Solution: Emphasize the importance of following the standard protocol and calibrate the group by cupping and discussing the same coffee together before individual evaluations.

4. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by the amount of new terminology.
   - Solution: Introduce terms gradually throughout the lesson, provide a glossary handout, and use visual aids to reinforce concepts.

5. **Challenge**: Ensuring all students can participate equally in cupping sessions.
   - Solution: Rotate positions around the cupping table and assign specific roles (e.g., breaking the crust, taking notes) to ensure everyone gets hands-on experience with each aspect of the process.
