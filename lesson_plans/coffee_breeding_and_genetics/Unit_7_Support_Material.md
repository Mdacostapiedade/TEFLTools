## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language barrier**: Ensure key terms are explained clearly and provide visual aids. Consider having a translator available if needed.

2. **Varied levels of prior knowledge**: Start with a brief assessment to gauge students' understanding. Be prepared to provide additional explanations for those with less experience.

3. **Limited access to international market information**: Prepare handouts with current market data and trends. Encourage students to share any personal experiences with selling coffee.

4. **Skepticism about certification benefits**: Invite a local certified farmer or cooperative representative to share their experience and answer questions.

5. **Difficulty in role-playing negotiations**: Provide clear instructions and scenario cards. Consider demonstrating a mock negotiation before the activity.

6. **Limited understanding of global coffee industry**: Use relatable local examples and gradually introduce international concepts. Show videos of international coffee shops and roasteries if possible.

7. **Resistance to change in traditional practices**: Emphasize the balance between preserving cultural practices and adopting beneficial new methods. Highlight success stories of local farmers who have implemented changes.
