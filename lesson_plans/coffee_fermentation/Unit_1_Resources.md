# Lecture Notes

## History of Coffee in Timor-Leste

### Introduction by Portuguese Colonizers
- Coffee introduced to Timor-Leste in the early 19th century
- Portuguese saw potential for coffee cultivation due to suitable climate and terrain
- Initial plantations established in the highlands, particularly around Ermera and Aileu

### Development during Indonesian Occupation
- Coffee production continued under Indonesian rule (1975-1999)
- Focus on quantity over quality
- Introduction of Robusta varieties to increase yield

### Role in Post-Independence Economy
- Coffee became a symbol of economic independence after 2002
- Government and NGOs invested in improving coffee quality and production methods
- Emergence of cooperatives and smallholder farmer groups

## Economic Importance of Coffee

### Percentage of GDP
- Coffee accounts for approximately 80% of the country's agricultural exports
- Contributes about 10% to the national GDP

### Number of Families Involved in Coffee Production
- Estimated 25% of Timorese households (about 67,000 families) involved in coffee farming
- Primary source of income for many rural communities

### Export Statistics and Main Markets
- Annual coffee exports: approximately 7,000-10,000 tons
- Main export markets: USA, Germany, Portugal, Australia, and Japan
- Growing interest in Timorese coffee from specialty coffee roasters worldwide

## Timorese Coffee Varieties

### Arabica
- Characteristics: 
  * Lower caffeine content
