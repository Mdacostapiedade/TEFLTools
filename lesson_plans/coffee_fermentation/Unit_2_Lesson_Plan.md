# Lesson Plan: Coffee Cherry Processing Methods

## 1. Resources Needed

- Coffee cherries (ripe and at various stages)
- Pulping machine
- Fermentation tanks
- Drying beds or tables
- Moisture meter
- pH meter
- Samples of coffee processed by different methods
- Cupping equipment
- Projector and slides
- Handouts on processing methods

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe the main coffee processing methods: wet, dry, and honey/pulped natural
- Explain the steps involved in each processing method
- Compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of each method
- Analyze how different processing methods impact coffee flavor

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display various coffee cherries and ask students to describe what they see
- Discuss the importance of cherry selection in processing
- Brief discussion on students' prior knowledge of coffee processing

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Pulping
- Fermentation
- Mucilage
- Parchment
- Demucilaging
- Honey process

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Wet Processing (Washed Coffee)
- Steps: Sorting, pulping, fermentation, washing, drying
- Equipment needed
- Fermentation process and its importance

### Dry Processing (Natural Coffee)
- Steps: Sorting, drying with cherry intact
- Importance of careful drying
- Flavor characteristics of natural processed coffee

### Honey/Pulped Natural Processing
- Steps: Sorting, pulping, partial mucilage removal, drying
- Variations: yellow, red, black honey
- Flavor profile compared to washed and natural

For each method, discuss:
- Water usage
- Labor requirements
- Impact on flavor
- Suitability for different coffee varieties and regions

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

Divide the class into three groups, each assigned a processing method:
1. Each group demonstrates their assigned method using provided equipment
2. Groups rotate to observe and participate in each method
3. Students take notes on the differences they observe

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Cupping session: Students taste coffees processed by different methods
- Group discussion on flavor differences
- Students create a comparison chart of the three processing methods

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick quiz on the steps of each processing method
- Open discussion on which method might be most suitable for Timor-Leste coffee
- Recap of key points and addressing any remaining questions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 500-word essay on how a specific Timorese coffee cooperative uses processing methods
- Prepare a presentation on one processing method, including its history, global usage, and potential for Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Pulping: Removal of the coffee cherry's outer skin and some of the pulp
- Fermentation: Microbial breakdown of the mucilage layer surrounding coffee beans
- Mucilage: The slimy layer surrounding the coffee bean inside the cherry
- Parchment: The thin, papery layer encasing the green coffee bean
- Demucilaging: The process of removing mucilage from coffee beans
- Honey process: A method where some mucilage is left on the bean during drying
