# Lecture Notes

## Wet Processing (Washed Coffee)

### Introduction
- Wet processing is the most common method for high-quality Arabica coffees
- Originated in Yemen in the 16th century, widely adopted in the 19th century

### Steps
1. Sorting: Remove underripe, overripe, and defective cherries
2. Pulping: Remove the outer skin and some of the pulp
3. Fermentation: Break down the mucilage layer
4. Washing: Remove the fermented mucilage
5. Drying: Reduce moisture content to 10-12%

### Equipment Needed
- Flotation tanks for initial sorting
- Pulping machine
- Fermentation tanks
- Washing channels
- Drying beds or mechanical dryers

### Fermentation Process
- Duration: 12-36 hours, depending on climate and desired flavor profile
- Microbial activity breaks down pectin in the mucilage
- Factors affecting fermentation: temperature, pH, time, microbial population

### Advantages
- Clean, bright cup profile
- Consistent quality
- Reduced risk of defects

### Disadvantages
- High water usage
- Labor-intensive
- Risk of over-fermentation

## Dry Processing (Natural Coffee)

### Introduction
- Oldest method of coffee processing
- Common in regions with limited water resources

### Steps
1. Sorting: Remove underripe and defective cherries
2. Drying: Spread cherries on patios or raised beds
3. Turning: Regularly turn cherries to ensure even drying
4. Hulling: Remove dried cherry skin and parchment

### Key Considerations
- Drying time: 2-4 weeks, depending on climate
- Target moisture content: 10-12%
- Risk of mold growth if drying is too slow

### Advantages
- Lower water usage
- Less equipment required
- Fuller body, increased sweetness in cup profile

### Disadvantages
- Inconsistent quality
- Higher risk of defects
- Longer processing time

## Honey/Pulped Natural Processing

### Introduction
- Hybrid method combining aspects of wet and dry processing
- Originated in Brazil, gaining popularity in Central America

### Steps
1. Sorting: Remove underripe and defective cherries
2. Pulping: Remove the outer skin, leaving some or all mucilage
3. Drying: Spread beans with mucilage on patios or raised beds

### Variations
- Yellow Honey: 50% mucilage removed
- Red Honey: 25% mucilage removed
- Black Honey: No mucilage removed

### Key Considerations
- Drying time: 7-14 days, depending on honey level
- Careful monitoring to prevent mold growth
- Labor-intensive turning process

### Advantages
- Balanced flavor profile between washed and natural
- Lower water usage than wet processing
- Opportunity for flavor customization

### Disadvantages
- Risk of inconsistency
- Requires precise control during drying
- Limited shelf life compared to washed coffee
