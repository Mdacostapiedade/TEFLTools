Here are the support materials for the lesson on Coffee Cherry Processing Methods:

# Support Materials for Coffee Cherry Processing Methods Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Pulping**: Removal of the coffee cherry's outer skin and some of the pulp
- **Fermentation**: Microbial breakdown of the mucilage layer surrounding coffee beans
- **Mucilage**: The slimy layer surrounding the coffee bean inside the cherry
- **Parchment**: The thin, papery layer encasing the green coffee bean
- **Demucilaging**: The process of removing mucilage from coffee beans
- **Honey process**: A method where some mucilage is left on the bean during drying
- **Wet processing**: A method involving pulping, fermentation, and washing before drying
- **Dry processing**: A method where the entire cherry is dried intact
- **Cupping**: A standardized method of sensory evaluation for coffee

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Coffee Cherry Cross-Section Diagram
   - Description: A labeled diagram showing the layers of a coffee cherry, including the outer skin, pulp, mucilage, parchment, and bean.

2. Processing Methods Flowchart
   - Description: A flowchart comparing the steps involved in wet, dry, and honey processing methods side by side.

3. Fermentation Tank Illustration
   - Description: A simple illustration of a fermentation tank with labels indicating key parts and optimal conditions (e.g., temperature, pH).

4. Drying Bed Diagram
   - Description: An overhead view of a typical drying bed with annotations on proper coffee distribution and raking techniques.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Processing Methods Comparison Chart
   - Content: A table with columns for wet, dry, and honey processing. Rows include steps, equipment needed, water usage, labor requirements, and typical flavor profiles.

2. Fermentation Monitoring Log
   - Content: A worksheet for students to record time, temperature, pH, and sensory observations during the fermentation process.

3. Cupping Form
   - Content: A simplified version of the SCA cupping form, adapted for students to use during the tasting session.

4. Processing Method Selection Guide
   - Content: A decision tree to help students determine which processing method might be most suitable based on climate, resources, and desired flavor profile.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited access to different types of processing equipment
   - Solution: Use videos, simulations, or small-scale models to demonstrate equipment function. Partner with local cooperatives for equipment demonstrations.

2. Challenge: Students struggling to identify flavor differences in cupping
   - Solution: Start with more pronounced differences (e.g., washed vs. natural) before moving to subtler distinctions. Use flavor wheels and reference samples to build sensory vocabulary.

3. Challenge: Maintaining consistent fermentation conditions
   - Solution: If climate-controlled environments are unavailable, use insulated containers and regularly monitor temperatures. Emphasize the importance of recording all variables.

4. Challenge: Students unfamiliar with scientific concepts (e.g., pH, microbiology)
   - Solution: Provide basic introductions to relevant scientific concepts. Use analogies to everyday experiences to make topics more relatable.

5. Challenge: Difficulty in sourcing coffee at various processing stages
   - Solution: Plan ahead and coordinate with local farms or cooperatives. Consider preserving samples from previous harvests for educational purposes.

6. Challenge: Time constraints for hands-on activities
   - Solution: Prepare some stages in advance (e.g., pre-fermented samples) to allow students to experience the full process within the lesson timeframe. Use time-lapse videos to show longer processes.
