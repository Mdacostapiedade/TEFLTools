## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the role of fermentation in coffee processing
- Identify key microorganisms involved in coffee fermentation
- Describe factors that affect fermentation outcomes
- Conduct basic fermentation experiments
- Measure and interpret pH changes during fermentation

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Taste test: Provide students with samples of coffee processed with different fermentation methods (e.g., washed, natural, extended fermentation)
- Discuss the flavor differences and hypothesize about the role of fermentation in creating these differences

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Fermentation
- Microorganisms
- Yeast
- Lactic acid bacteria
- Acetic acid bacteria
- Pectin
- Mucilage
- Anaerobic/aerobic

   - Definition and purpose in coffee processing
   - Types of fermentation (wet, dry, anaerobic)

2. Microbiology of coffee fermentation
   - Key microorganisms and their roles
   - Stages of fermentation

3. Factors affecting fermentation
   - Time
   - Temperature
   - pH
   - Oxygen availability

## 7. Production Tasks (90 minutes)

1. Fermentation experiment setup (60 minutes)
   - Divide class into groups
   - Each group sets up a fermentation experiment with different parameters (e.g., temperature, time, added yeast)
   - Record initial measurements and observations

2. Experiment monitoring plan (30 minutes)
   - Groups create a monitoring plan for their experiment
   - Include pH measurements, sensory evaluations, and microbial observations
   - Prepare data collection sheets

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Address any questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Research paper (500 words) on an innovative coffee fermentation technique
2. Daily monitoring of fermentation experiments (pH, temperature, sensory notes)
3. Read assigned chapter on coffee microbiology

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Fermentation: The metabolic process by which microorganisms break down sugars and other compounds, often producing desirable flavors and reducing mucilage in coffee processing.
- Microorganisms: Microscopic living organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and fungi, that play a crucial role in coffee fermentation.
- Yeast: Single-celled fungi that convert sugars into alcohol and other compounds during fermentation.
- Lactic acid bacteria: Bacteria that produce lactic acid as a major metabolic end-product of carbohydrate fermentation.
- Acetic acid bacteria: Bacteria that oxidize ethanol to acetic acid in the presence of oxygen.
- Pectin: A structural heteropolysaccharide found in plant cell walls, particularly abundant in coffee cherry mucilage.
- Mucilage: The slimy layer surrounding coffee beans, composed mainly of pectin, which is broken down during fermentation.
- Anaerobic: Occurring in the absence of oxygen.
- Aerobic: Occurring in the presence of oxygen.
