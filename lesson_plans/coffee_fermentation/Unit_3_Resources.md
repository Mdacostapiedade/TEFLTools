## Introduction to Coffee Fermentation

### Definition and Purpose
- Fermentation in coffee processing: Controlled microbial activity that breaks down mucilage surrounding coffee beans
- Purpose: Enhance flavor development, reduce mucilage, facilitate drying

### Types of Fermentation
1. Wet fermentation
   - Beans submerged in water
   - Common in washed processing
2. Dry fermentation
   - Beans ferment within intact cherry
   - Used in natural processing
3. Anaerobic fermentation
   - Oxygen-free environment
   - Often used for specialty coffee production

## Microbiology of Coffee Fermentation

### Key Microorganisms
1. Yeasts
   - Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   - Pichia kluyveri
2. Lactic Acid Bacteria
   - Lactobacillus plantarum
   - Leuconostoc mesenteroides
3. Acetic Acid Bacteria
   - Acetobacter aceti
   - Gluconobacter oxydans

### Stages of Fermentation
1. Initial stage (0-12 hours)
   - Yeast dominance
   - Rapid sugar consumption
2. Middle stage (12-36 hours)
   - Lactic acid bacteria proliferation
   - pH decrease
3. Final stage (36-48+ hours)
   - Acetic acid bacteria activity
   - Risk of over-fermentation

## Factors Affecting Fermentation

### Time
- Typical range: 12-48 hours
- Extended fermentation: 48+ hours
- Impact on flavor profile and acidity

### Temperature
- Optimal range: 20-30°C (68-86°F)
- Higher temperatures accelerate fermentation
- Lower temperatures slow fermentation, potentially enhancing complexity

### pH
- Initial pH: 5.5-6.0
- Decreases during fermentation
- Target end pH: 4.0-4.5

### Oxygen Availability
- Aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions
- Influence on microbial population and metabolic pathways

### Initial Microbial Population
- Natural microflora on coffee cherries
- Influence of processing environment
- Use of starter cultures

## Traditional vs. Controlled Fermentation Methods

### Traditional Methods
- Advantages:
  * Simplicity
  * Low cost
  * Potential for unique flavor profiles
- Disadvantages:
  * Inconsistency
  * Risk of defects
  * Limited control

### Controlled Fermentation
- Advantages:
  * Consistency
  * Precise flavor development
  * Reduced risk of defects
- Disadvantages:
  * Higher cost
  * Requires specialized equipment and knowledge

### Innovative Techniques
- Carbonic maceration
- Yeast inoculation
- Temperature-controlled fermentation tanks

## Monitoring Fermentation

### pH Measurement
- Use of pH meter or pH strips
- Frequency: Every 4-6 hours
- Interpretation of pH changes

### Sensory Evaluation
- Aroma assessment
- Visual inspection of mucilage breakdown
- Tactile evaluation of bean surface

### Microbial Activity Assessment
- Microscopic observation
- Plating techniques for enumeration
- Molecular methods (e.g., qPCR)
