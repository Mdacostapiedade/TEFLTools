# Support Material for Fermentation in Coffee Processing Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Fermentation**: The metabolic process by which microorganisms break down sugars and other compounds, often producing desirable flavors and reducing mucilage in coffee processing.
- **Microorganisms**: Microscopic living organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and fungi, that play a crucial role in coffee fermentation.
- **Yeast**: Single-celled fungi that convert sugars into alcohol and other compounds during fermentation.
- **Lactic acid bacteria**: Bacteria that produce lactic acid as a major metabolic end-product of carbohydrate fermentation.
- **Acetic acid bacteria**: Bacteria that oxidize ethanol to acetic acid in the presence of oxygen.
- **Pectin**: A structural heteropolysaccharide found in plant cell walls, particularly abundant in coffee cherry mucilage.
- **Mucilage**: The slimy layer surrounding coffee beans, composed mainly of pectin, which is broken down during fermentation.
- **Anaerobic**: Occurring in the absence of oxygen.
- **Aerobic**: Occurring in the presence of oxygen.
- **pH**: A measure of acidity or alkalinity on a scale of 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Coffee Cherry Cross-Section Diagram
   - Description: A labeled diagram showing the layers of a coffee cherry, highlighting the mucilage layer where fermentation occurs.

2. Fermentation Process Flowchart
   - Description: A flowchart illustrating the stages of coffee fermentation, from initial microbial colonization to final breakdown of mucilage.

3. Microorganism Identification Chart
   - Description: A visual guide showing microscopic images of common microorganisms found in coffee fermentation (yeast, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria).

4. pH Scale for Coffee Fermentation
   - Description: A colorful pH scale (0-14) with markers indicating optimal pH ranges for coffee fermentation and corresponding flavor notes.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Fermentation Experiment Data Sheet
   - Content: Table for recording fermentation parameters (time, temperature, pH) and sensory observations over the course of the experiment.

2. Microorganism Identification Worksheet
   - Content: Images of different microorganisms with space for students to label and describe their characteristics and roles in fermentation.

3. Fermentation Factor Analysis
   - Content: A chart listing different fermentation factors (time, temperature, oxygen availability, etc.) with columns for students to describe how each factor affects fermentation outcomes.

4. Coffee Flavor Wheel for Fermentation Notes
   - Content: A simplified coffee flavor wheel with emphasis on fermentation-related flavors, allowing students to circle or highlight flavors they detect during tasting exercises.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Maintaining sterile conditions for fermentation experiments
   - Tip: Emphasize proper sanitization techniques and provide pre-sterilized equipment when possible. Demonstrate aseptic technique before experiments.

2. Challenge: Students struggling with microscope use
   - Tip: Provide a brief microscope tutorial at the beginning of the lesson. Have pre-prepared slides available for comparison.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in perceiving subtle flavor differences in taste tests
   - Tip: Start with more pronounced differences in samples. Gradually introduce subtler variations as students develop their palates.

4. Challenge: Keeping fermentation experiments consistent across groups
   - Tip: Prepare a detailed protocol for students to follow. Consider assigning roles within each group to ensure consistency.

5. Challenge: Managing time for fermentation experiments
   - Tip: Set up long-term experiments in advance. Use accelerated fermentation techniques for in-class demonstrations.

6. Challenge: Explaining complex biochemical processes
   - Tip: Use analogies and visual aids to simplify concepts. Break down complex processes into smaller, more digestible steps.

7. Challenge: Addressing varying levels of prior knowledge among students
   - Tip: Conduct a pre-lesson assessment to gauge understanding. Provide additional resources for students who need extra support or challenge.
