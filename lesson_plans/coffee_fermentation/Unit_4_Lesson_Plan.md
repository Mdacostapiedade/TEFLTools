# Lesson Plan: Drying and Storage of Coffee

## 1. Resources Needed

- Coffee samples at different moisture levels
- Moisture meter
- Sun drying beds
- Mechanical dryer (if available)
- Various packaging materials (jute bags, GrainPro bags, vacuum-sealed bags)
- Hygrometer
- Thermometer
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on moisture content guidelines and storage best practices

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the importance of proper drying in coffee processing
- Compare and contrast sun drying and mechanical drying methods
- Measure and interpret coffee bean moisture content
- Describe optimal storage conditions for maintaining coffee quality
- Select appropriate packaging materials for coffee storage

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display various coffee samples with different moisture levels
- Ask students to touch and observe the samples, noting differences in texture, smell, and appearance
- Discuss observations as a class, introducing the concept of moisture content

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Moisture content
- Water activity
- Equilibrium moisture content
- Hygroscopic
- Parchment coffee
- Green coffee

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Sun Drying
- Process overview
- Advantages and disadvantages
- Best practices for sun drying

### Mechanical Drying
- Types of mechanical dryers
- Process overview
- Advantages and disadvantages
- Best practices for mechanical drying

### Moisture Content and Measurement
- Importance of proper moisture levels
- Target moisture content for storage
- Using a moisture meter

### Storage Conditions
- Temperature and humidity control
- Ventilation
- Pest management

### Packaging Materials
- Jute bags
- GrainPro bags
- Vacuum-sealed bags
- Pros and cons of each

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Moisture Content Measurement (20 minutes)
   - Divide students into groups
   - Provide each group with coffee samples and a moisture meter
   - Have students measure and record moisture content of different samples

2. Drying Method Comparison (25 minutes)
   - Set up stations for sun drying and mechanical drying (if available)
   - Have students rotate through stations, practicing each method
   - Discuss observations and compare efficiency of each method

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Storage Plan Development
   - In small groups, have students develop a storage plan for a hypothetical coffee lot
   - Plan should include packaging choice, storage conditions, and monitoring procedures
   - Groups present their plans to the class for feedback

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Quick quiz on moisture content targets and storage best practices

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a 1-page report on how climate conditions in Timor-Leste affect coffee drying and storage practices
2. Measure and record the temperature and relative humidity in their home storage area for coffee over 3 days, then calculate the average

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Moisture content: The amount of water present in coffee beans, expressed as a percentage of total weight
- Water activity: The amount of water available for microbial growth and chemical reactions in coffee beans
- Equilibrium moisture content: The moisture content at which coffee beans neither gain nor lose moisture to the surrounding air
- Hygroscopic: The ability of a substance (like coffee) to absorb moisture from the air
- Parchment coffee: Coffee beans that still have the parchment layer attached after wet processing
- Green coffee: Unroasted coffee beans that have had the parchment layer removed
