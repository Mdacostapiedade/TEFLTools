# Lecture Notes

## Sun Drying

### Process Overview
- Coffee beans are spread in thin layers on raised beds or patios
- Beans are raked regularly to ensure even drying
- Drying typically takes 7-14 days, depending on weather conditions
- Beans are covered at night or during rain

### Advantages
- Low initial investment
- Produces a sweet, smooth flavor profile
- Suitable for small-scale producers

### Disadvantages
- Weather-dependent
- Labor-intensive
- Risk of contamination from dust, animals
- Inconsistent drying

### Best Practices
- Use raised beds for better air circulation
- Maintain a bean layer thickness of 3-5 cm
- Rake beans every 30-45 minutes during peak sun hours
- Cover beans when relative humidity exceeds 65%
- Aim for a gradual moisture reduction of 1% per day

## Mechanical Drying

### Types of Mechanical Dryers
- Vertical dryers (e.g., columnar dryers)
- Horizontal dryers (e.g., rotary dryers)
- Stationary bed dryers

### Process Overview
- Coffee beans are loaded into the dryer
- Hot air (usually 45-50째C) is forced through the beans
- Drying time ranges from 12-24 hours, depending on initial moisture content

### Advantages
- Faster drying time
- More consistent results
- Less labor-intensive
- Weather-independent

### Disadvantages
- Higher initial investment
- Energy costs
- Risk of over-drying or uneven drying if not properly monitored

### Best Practices
- Maintain air temperature between 45-50째C
- Ensure even airflow through the coffee bed
- Monitor moisture content regularly during drying
- Allow beans to rest for 8-12 hours after mechanical drying before packaging

## Moisture Content and Measurement

### Importance of Proper Moisture Levels
- Prevents mold growth and mycotoxin formation
- Maintains coffee quality during storage
- Affects coffee's shelf life

### Target Moisture Content
- For green coffee: 10-12%
- For parchment coffee: 11-12.5%

### Using a Moisture Meter
- Calibrate the meter before use
- Take multiple readings from different parts of the coffee lot
- Clean the meter between samples
- Record readings and calculate the average

## Storage Conditions

### Temperature and Humidity Control
- Ideal temperature: 20-25째C
- Ideal relative humidity: 50-60%
- Use air conditioning or dehumidifiers if necessary

### Ventilation
- Ensure proper air circulation to prevent "sweating"
- Leave space between stacks of coffee bags
- Use pallets to keep coffee off the floor

### Pest Management
- Implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program
- Regular cleaning and inspection of storage areas
- Use traps and baits as needed
- Avoid chemical pesticides near coffee

## Packaging Materials

### Jute Bags
- Traditional packaging for coffee
- Breathable, allowing moisture exchange
- Susceptible to moisture and pest infiltration

### GrainPro Bags
- Hermetic packaging that creates a barrier against moisture and pests
- Maintains stable moisture content
- Can be used inside jute bags for added protection

### Vacuum-Sealed Bags
- Removes air to prevent oxidation
- Excellent for long-term storage
- Higher cost and requires special equipment

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the choice between sun drying and mechanical drying affect the final flavor profile of coffee?
2. What are the main challenges in maintaining proper moisture content during coffee storage in Timor-Leste's climate?
3. How might climate change impact coffee drying practices in Timor-Leste in the coming years?
4. Compare the cost-effectiveness of different packaging materials for small-scale coffee producers in Timor-Leste.
5. How can proper drying and storage practices contribute to increasing the value of Timorese coffee in international markets?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay comparing traditional coffee drying and storage methods in Timor-Leste with modern techniques introduced in this lesson. Consider the following points:

- Effectiveness in maintaining coffee quality
- Cultural significance of traditional methods
- Economic implications for small-scale farmers
- Environmental sustainability
- Potential for combining traditional and modern approaches

# Assignment Details

## Moisture Content Monitoring Project

1. Obtain a small sample of green coffee beans (100g)
2. Measure and record the initial moisture content
3. Store the sample in three different conditions:
   a. In a paper bag at room temperature
   b. In a sealed plastic container at room temperature
   c. In a sealed plastic container in the refrigerator
4. Measure and record the moisture content of each sample every day for one week
5. Create a graph showing the changes in moisture content over time
6. Write a short report (300-500 words) analyzing the results and discussing the implications for coffee storage
