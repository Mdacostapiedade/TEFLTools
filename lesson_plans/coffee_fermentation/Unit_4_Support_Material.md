Here's the support material for the lesson on Drying and Storage of Coffee, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material: Drying and Storage of Coffee

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Moisture content**: The amount of water present in coffee beans, expressed as a percentage of total weight
- **Water activity**: The amount of water available for microbial growth and chemical reactions in coffee beans
- **Equilibrium moisture content**: The moisture content at which coffee beans neither gain nor lose moisture to the surrounding air
- **Hygroscopic**: The ability of a substance (like coffee) to absorb moisture from the air
- **Parchment coffee**: Coffee beans that still have the parchment layer attached after wet processing
- **Green coffee**: Unroasted coffee beans that have had the parchment layer removed
- **Sun drying**: A natural method of drying coffee beans using solar energy
- **Mechanical drying**: Using machines to dry coffee beans with controlled heat and airflow
- **Jute bags**: Traditional breathable bags made from natural fibers, used for coffee storage
- **GrainPro bags**: Specialized hermetic bags designed to protect coffee from moisture and pests
- **Vacuum-sealed bags**: Airtight packaging that removes air to preserve coffee freshness

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Moisture Content Diagram:
   - A simple bar chart showing optimal moisture content ranges for different stages of coffee processing (e.g., fresh cherry, parchment, green coffee)

2. Sun Drying vs. Mechanical Drying Comparison:
   - A side-by-side illustration showing the setup and process for both drying methods

3. Storage Conditions Infographic:
   - A visual representation of ideal temperature, humidity, and ventilation for coffee storage

4. Packaging Materials Comparison:
   - A table or chart comparing jute bags, GrainPro bags, and vacuum-sealed bags, highlighting pros and cons of each

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Moisture Content Measurement Worksheet:
   - Table for recording moisture content measurements of different coffee samples
   - Space for observations on texture, smell, and appearance
   - Questions prompting students to analyze the relationship between moisture content and sensory characteristics

2. Drying Method Comparison Chart:
   - Two-column chart for students to fill in advantages and disadvantages of sun drying and mechanical drying based on their observations and class discussion

3. Storage Plan Template:
   - Outline for students to develop a storage plan, including sections for:
     * Packaging choice and justification
     * Temperature and humidity control measures
     * Ventilation strategies
     * Pest management approach
     * Monitoring procedures and frequency

4. Online moisture meter calibration tools and tutorials
5. Local climate data resources for Timor-Leste to support homework assignment

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Limited access to mechanical drying equipment:
   - Focus on principles of mechanical drying and use videos or simulations if equipment is unavailable
   - Emphasize sun drying techniques more relevant to local practices

2. Varying levels of prior knowledge among students:
   - Conduct a pre-lesson assessment to gauge understanding
   - Pair more experienced students with those who need additional support during activities

3. Difficulty in obtaining multiple coffee samples with different moisture levels:
   - Prepare samples in advance by rehydrating or further drying available coffee
   - Use visual aids and descriptions if actual samples are limited

4. Challenges in relating storage conditions to local context:
   - Invite local coffee producers or storage facility managers as guest speakers
   - Encourage students to share their observations of storage practices in their communities

5. Language barriers when introducing technical terms:
   - Provide vocabulary lists with local language translations where possible
   - Use visual aids and hands-on demonstrations to reinforce concepts

6. Limited time for hands-on activities:
   - Prioritize key activities and consider extending practice into homework assignments
   - Create stations for different activities that students can rotate through in smaller groups

By addressing these potential challenges, teachers can ensure a more effective and engaging learning experience for students in the context of coffee processing and storage in Timor-Leste.
