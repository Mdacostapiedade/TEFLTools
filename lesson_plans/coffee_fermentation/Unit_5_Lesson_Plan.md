# Lesson Plan: Coffee Roasting

## 1. Resources Needed

- Coffee roasting machine (traditional and modern)
- Green coffee beans (various varieties from Timor-Leste)
- Roasting logs and pens
- Thermometer and timer
- Cooling trays
- Cupping equipment (cups, spoons, grinder, hot water kettle)
- Flavor wheel and cupping forms
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer for presentations

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the basic principles of coffee roasting
- Identify different roast levels visually and by taste
- Describe the chemical changes that occur during roasting
- Compare traditional and modern roasting techniques
- Conduct a basic cupping session to evaluate roast profiles

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display various roasted coffee samples (light, medium, dark)
- Ask students to arrange them in order from lightest to darkest
- Discuss their observations and predictions about how roast level might affect flavor

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Maillard reaction
- First crack / Second crack
- Roast profile
- Endothermic / Exothermic
- Degassing
- Chaff

Use visual aids and examples to reinforce understanding.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

1. Introduction to coffee roasting
   - Purpose of roasting
   - Overview of the roasting process

2. Chemical changes during roasting
   - Maillard reaction and caramelization
   - Development of aromatics and flavors
   - Changes in acidity, body, and sweetness

3. Roast levels and their characteristics
   - Light, medium, and dark roasts
   - Impact on flavor profile

4. Roasting techniques
   - Traditional methods (pan roasting, wood-fired roasters)
   - Modern drum and air roasters
   - Controlling variables: time, temperature, airflow

5. Roast profiling
   - Developing a roast curve
   - Adjusting profiles for different coffee varieties

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

1. Roasting demonstration
   - Instructor demonstrates roasting a batch of coffee, explaining each stage
   - Students observe and take notes on roast log sheets

2. Hands-on roasting practice
   - In small groups, students roast coffee using both traditional and modern methods
   - Each group roasts to a different level (light, medium, dark)
   - Students record time, temperature, and observations

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

Cupping session:
- Students prepare and conduct a cupping of their roasted samples
- Evaluate and compare flavors, aromas, and body of different roast levels
- Discuss how roast profiles affected the cup quality

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Discuss challenges faced during roasting and cupping
- Address any questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a 500-word essay on how different roast levels might best suit various Timorese coffee varieties.
2. Create a roast profile plan for a specific Timorese coffee, explaining your choices.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Maillard reaction: Chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned foods their distinctive flavor.
- First crack: Audible popping sound during roasting when beans expand and cell walls break.
- Second crack: Louder, more violent popping occurring in darker roasts as oils emerge on bean surface.
- Roast profile: The planned progression of time and temperature during the roasting process.
- Endothermic: Absorbing heat (early stage of roasting).
- Exothermic: Releasing heat (later stage of roasting).
- Degassing: Release of CO2 from freshly roasted coffee beans.
- Chaff: The silverskin or outer layer of the coffee bean that comes off during roasting.
