## Introduction to Coffee Roasting

### Purpose of Roasting
- Transform green coffee beans into roasted beans suitable for brewing
- Develop flavors, aromas, and colors
- Reduce moisture content and make beans more brittle for grinding

### Overview of the Roasting Process
1. Drying phase: Moisture evaporation
2. Browning phase: Maillard reactions begin
3. Development phase: Flavor compounds develop
4. Cooling: Rapid cooling to stop the roast

## Chemical Changes During Roasting

### Maillard Reaction and Caramelization
- Maillard reaction: Interaction between amino acids and reducing sugars
- Produces hundreds of flavor compounds and brown colors
- Caramelization: Breakdown of sugars at high temperatures

### Development of Aromatics and Flavors
- Formation of volatile compounds
- Creation of oils that carry flavors
- Balance between acidity, sweetness, and bitterness

### Changes in Acidity, Body, and Sweetness
- Acidity decreases as roast progresses
- Body increases due to oil development
- Sweetness peaks in medium roasts, then declines

## Roast Levels and Their Characteristics

### Light Roast
- High acidity, light body
- Floral and fruit notes prominent
- Typically reached just after first crack

### Medium Roast
- Balanced acidity and body
- Caramel sweetness develops
- Reached between first and second crack

### Dark Roast
- Low acidity, heavy body
- Bitter and smoky flavors dominate
- Reached at or after second crack

## Roasting Techniques

### Traditional Methods
- Pan roasting: Manual stirring over heat source
- Wood-fired roasters: Indirect heat, requires skill to maintain temperature

### Modern Drum and Air Roasters
- Drum roasters: Rotating drum with heat applied externally
- Air roasters: Hot air circulates through coffee beans

### Controlling Variables
- Time: Total duration of roast
- Temperature: Heat applied throughout roast
- Airflow: Affects heat distribution and chaff removal

## Roast Profiling

### Developing a Roast Curve
- Plot of temperature over time
- Key points: turning point, yellowing, first crack, development time

### Adjusting Profiles for Different Coffee Varieties
- Consider density, moisture content, and bean size
- Adapt to highlight desirable characteristics of each variety

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the roasting process affect the chemical composition of coffee beans?
2. What are the key differences between light, medium, and dark roasts in terms of flavor profile?
3. How might traditional roasting methods used in Timor-Leste impact the final cup quality compared to modern roasting techniques?
4. What factors should be considered when developing a roast profile for a specific Timorese coffee variety?
5. How does the Maillard reaction contribute to the development of coffee flavors during roasting?
6. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of air roasting compared to drum roasting?
7. How might different roast levels affect the perception of terroir in Timorese coffees?
8. What role does the cooling process play in preserving the quality of freshly roasted coffee?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Roast Profile Analysis

1. Select a Timorese coffee variety (e.g., Timor Hybrid, Typica, or Catimor).
2. Research its typical flavor characteristics and growing conditions.
3. Write a 500-word essay proposing an ideal roast profile for this variety, including:
   - Suggested roast level and why
   - Key temperature points during the roast
   - Expected flavor outcomes
   - How the profile highlights the variety's unique qualities
4. Conclude with how this roast profile might contribute to showcasing Timorese coffee in the specialty market.

# Assignment Details

## Roast Comparison Project

### Objective
Compare the effects of different roast levels on the same Timorese coffee variety.

### Instructions
1. Obtain 1 kg of green coffee beans from a single Timorese variety.
2. Divide the beans into three equal portions.
3. Roast each portion to a different level: light, medium, and dark.
4. For each roast, record:
   - Time-temperature curve
   - Total roast time
   - Time to first crack
   - Development time after first crack
   - Final temperature
   - Weight loss percentage
5. Conduct a cupping session for each roast level, noting:
   - Aroma
   - Flavor
   - Acidity
   - Body
   - Aftertaste
6. Prepare a report including:
   - Roast profiles (graphs)
   - Cupping notes
   - Analysis of how roast level affected the coffee's characteristics
   - Recommendation for the optimal roast level for this variety

### Submission
Submit a written report (1000-1500 words) and present your findings to the class in a 10-minute presentation.
