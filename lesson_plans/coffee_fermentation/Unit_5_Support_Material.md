# Support Material for Coffee Roasting Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Maillard reaction**: Chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned foods their distinctive flavor.
- **First crack**: Audible popping sound during roasting when beans expand and cell walls break.
- **Second crack**: Louder, more violent popping occurring in darker roasts as oils emerge on bean surface.
- **Roast profile**: The planned progression of time and temperature during the roasting process.
- **Endothermic**: Absorbing heat (early stage of roasting).
- **Exothermic**: Releasing heat (later stage of roasting).
- **Degassing**: Release of CO2 from freshly roasted coffee beans.
- **Chaff**: The silverskin or outer layer of the coffee bean that comes off during roasting.
- **Green coffee**: Unroasted coffee beans.
- **Cupping**: A standardized method of evaluating coffee flavor and quality.
- **Flavor wheel**: A visual tool used to describe and categorize coffee flavors.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Roast Level Comparison Chart**:
   - Description: A visual chart showing different roast levels from light to dark, with corresponding bean colors and typical flavor characteristics.

2. **Coffee Roasting Process Diagram**:
   - Description: A flowchart illustrating the stages of coffee roasting, including temperature changes, first and second crack, and key chemical reactions.

3. **Flavor Wheel**:
   - Description: A circular diagram showing the hierarchy of coffee flavors, from broad categories to specific taste descriptors.

4. **Roast Profile Graph**:
   - Description: A line graph showing temperature over time during a typical roast, highlighting key points like turning point, first crack, and development time.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to identify roast levels visually.
   - Solution: Provide a clear color chart and practice with multiple samples. Use a color analyzer app if available.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in timing first and second crack accurately.
   - Solution: Use audio recordings of cracks for practice. Emphasize the importance of focused listening during roasting.

3. **Challenge**: Inconsistent results in hands-on roasting practice.
   - Solution: Stress the importance of precise measurement and record-keeping. Pair students to double-check each other's work.

4. **Challenge**: Students overwhelmed by cupping terminology.
   - Solution: Introduce terms gradually. Use familiar flavor references and encourage students to develop their own vocabulary alongside standard terms.

5. **Challenge**: Ensuring safety with hot equipment and beans.
   - Solution: Provide thorough safety briefing, require protective gear, and closely supervise all hands-on activities.

6. **Challenge**: Limited access to various coffee varieties for comparison.
   - Solution: Prepare pre-roasted samples of different varieties if green coffee is not available. Use video resources to supplement.

7. **Challenge**: Students struggling to understand the chemical processes.
   - Solution: Use visual aids and simple experiments to demonstrate concepts like Maillard reaction. Relate to familiar cooking processes.
