## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Limited access to coffee by-products**: 
   - Solution: Prepare in advance by sourcing samples from local roasters or importers. If unavailable, use detailed descriptions and images.

2. **Varying levels of prior knowledge among students**:
   - Solution: Start with a brief review of basic coffee concepts. Use the warm-up activity to gauge existing knowledge and adjust the lesson accordingly.

3. **Difficulty in conceptualizing new products**:
   - Solution: Provide examples of successful coffee-based products from other countries. Encourage creative thinking by brainstorming unconventional uses for coffee and its by-products.

4. **Limited design skills for packaging activity**:
   - Solution: Provide templates or basic design software tutorials. Emphasize that the focus is on concept rather than artistic skill.

5. **Lack of familiarity with export markets**:
   - Solution: Invite a guest speaker from a local exporting company or use case studies to illustrate export market requirements and challenges.

6. **Time management for multiple activities**:
   - Solution: Be prepared to adjust activity durations based on student engagement and progress. Have additional discussion questions ready in case activities take less time than expected.
