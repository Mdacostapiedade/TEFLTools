# Lesson Plan: Quality Control and Cupping

## 1. Resources Needed

- Green coffee samples with various defects
- Roasted coffee samples of different qualities
- Cupping equipment (cups, spoons, hot water kettles, grinders)
- SCA Flavor Wheel posters
- Cupping forms
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and screen
- Laptop with presentation software

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify common coffee defects in green and roasted coffee
- Understand and apply standard cupping protocols
- Use sensory evaluation skills to assess coffee quality
- Interpret and use the SCA Flavor Wheel
- Understand basic coffee grading systems

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Blind aroma test: Present 5 covered cups with different aromas (e.g., chocolate, lemon, grass, cinnamon, coffee)
- Students try to identify the aromas and discuss their experiences
- Introduce the importance of sensory skills in coffee quality assessment

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Present and explain key terms:
  - Cupping
  - Defects (primary, secondary)
  - Flavor attributes (acidity, body, aroma, etc.)
  - Green coffee grading
  - Roast profiling

- Use visual aids and real coffee samples to illustrate concepts

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Coffee Defects and Their Causes
- Overview of common defects in green and roasted coffee
- Causes of defects (processing errors, storage issues, roasting problems)
- Impact of defects on cup quality

### Cupping Protocols
- SCA cupping standards
- Cupping room setup and equipment
- Steps in the cupping process (dry fragrance, wet aroma, breaking the crust, tasting)

### Flavor Wheel and Sensory Evaluation
- Introduction to the SCA Flavor Wheel
- Basic taste components (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami)
- Describing coffee flavors and attributes

### Grading Systems
- Overview of green coffee grading (size, defects, density)
- Roasted coffee grading and scoring systems

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

### Activity 1: Defect Identification (20 minutes)
- Provide samples of green and roasted coffee with various defects
- Students work in pairs to identify and categorize defects
- Class discussion on findings and impact on quality

### Activity 2: Cupping Session (40 minutes)
- Set up a formal cupping session with 3-4 different coffee samples
- Guide students through the cupping protocol
- Students practice evaluating and scoring coffees using cupping forms

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

### Task 1: Flavor Wheel Application
- Students create flavor profiles for the cupped coffees using the Flavor Wheel
- Present and compare results in small groups

### Task 2: Quality Improvement Recommendations
- Based on the cupping results, students develop recommendations for improving the lower-scoring coffees
- Share ideas with the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Brief discussion on the importance of quality control in the Timorese coffee industry

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 500-word report on a specific coffee defect, its causes, and prevention methods
- Practice cupping at home with three different coffee samples, recording observations and scores

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Cupping: A standardized method of sensory evaluation used to assess coffee quality
- Defect: An imperfection in green or roasted coffee that negatively affects quality
- Flavor attributes: Characteristics of coffee taste and aroma, such as acidity, body, and sweetness
- Green coffee grading: A system for classifying unroasted coffee beans based on size, density, and defect count
- Roast profiling: The process of controlling time and temperature during coffee roasting to achieve desired flavor characteristics
