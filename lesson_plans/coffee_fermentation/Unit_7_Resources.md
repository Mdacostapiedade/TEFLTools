## Coffee Defects and Their Causes

### Green Coffee Defects
- Full black beans: Caused by over-fermentation or picking unripe cherries
- Partial black beans: Result of uneven drying or insect damage
- Sour beans: Caused by improper fermentation or delays in processing
- Floaters: Underdeveloped or insect-damaged beans
- Shells: Malformed beans due to genetic factors or poor growing conditions
- Broken/chipped beans: Result of mechanical damage during processing

### Roasted Coffee Defects
- Scorched beans: Overexposure to heat during roasting
- Tipped beans: Localized burning, often due to high heat at the start of roasting
- Quakers: Unripe or defective beans that don't roast properly
- Baked flavor: Result of prolonged roasting at low temperatures

### Causes of Defects
- Processing errors: Improper fermentation, inadequate washing, uneven drying
- Storage issues: High humidity, temperature fluctuations, pest infestations
- Roasting problems: Inconsistent heat application, equipment malfunction
- Agricultural factors: Plant diseases, poor harvesting practices, environmental stress

## Cupping Protocols and Flavor Wheel

### SCA Cupping Standards
- Sample preparation: 8.25g coffee per 150ml water
- Grind size: Slightly coarser than typical drip brewing
- Water temperature: 200°F (93°C)
- Infusion time: 4 minutes before evaluation begins

### Cupping Process Steps
1. Evaluate dry fragrance of the ground coffee
2. Add hot water and evaluate wet aroma
3. Break the crust after 3-5 minutes and evaluate aroma
4. Allow coffee to cool and begin tasting (slurping)
5. Evaluate flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, and overall impression

### SCA Flavor Wheel
- Structure: Three tiers of increasingly specific flavor descriptors
- Main categories: Fruity, Sour/Fermented, Green/Vegetative, Other, Roasted, Spices, Nutty/Cocoa, Sweet, Floral
- Using the wheel: Start from the center and work outwards to refine descriptions

### Basic Taste Components
- Sweet: Perceived on the tip of the tongue
- Sour: Detected on the sides of the tongue
- Salty: Tasted on the front and sides of the tongue
- Bitter: Perceived at the back of the tongue
- Umami: Savory taste, detected across the tongue

## Grading Systems for Green and Roasted Coffee

### Green Coffee Grading
- Screen size: Measured using sieves with different hole sizes
- Defect count: Number and type of defects in a 300g sample
- Density: Measured using specialized equipment or water displacement

### Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) Green Coffee Classification
- Grade 1: 0-3 full defects, no primary defects allowed
- Grade 2: 4-12 full defects, no primary defects allowed
- Grade 3: 13-25 full defects, no primary defects allowed
- Grade 4: 26-50 full defects, no primary defects allowed
- Grade 5: 51-100 full defects, no primary defects allowed

### Roasted Coffee Grading
- Agtron scale: Measures roast color from light to dark (higher numbers = lighter roast)
- Sensory evaluation: Based on cupping scores (0-100 scale)
- SCAA cupping form categories: Fragrance/Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity, Clean Cup, Sweetness, Overall

# Discussion Questions

1. How do different processing methods (wet, dry, honey) affect the likelihood of certain coffee defects?
2. In what ways can proper storage conditions prevent the development of defects in green coffee?
3. How might climate change impact the prevalence of certain coffee defects in Timor-Leste?
4. Discuss the relationship between roast profile and the expression of flavor attributes on the SCA Flavor Wheel.
5. How can the cupping process be standardized to ensure consistent quality assessment across different evaluators?
6. What are the potential economic impacts of improving overall coffee quality in Timor-Leste?
7. How might traditional Timorese coffee preparation methods influence local perceptions of coffee quality?
8. Discuss the pros and cons of implementing a national coffee grading system in Timor-Leste.

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Coffee Quality Improvement Plan

Write a 1000-word essay outlining a comprehensive plan to improve coffee quality in a hypothetical Timorese coffee cooperative. Your plan should address the following points:

1. Identifying current quality issues and their root causes
2. Implementing improved processing techniques
3. Establishing a quality control system
4. Training farmers and processors in best practices
5. Developing a cupping program for ongoing quality assessment
6. Creating incentives for producing higher quality coffee
7. Addressing potential challenges and obstacles

Your essay should demonstrate an understanding of coffee defects, processing methods, quality control techniques, and the specific context of coffee production in Timor-Leste.

# Assignment Details

## Defect Identification and Analysis Project

1. Obtain samples of green coffee beans from a local producer or cooperative (minimum 100g).
2. Sort through the sample and identify any defects present.
3. Categorize the defects found and calculate the percentage of each defect type.
4. Research the potential causes of the most prevalent defects in your sample.
5. Prepare a report (750-1000 words) that includes:
   - A detailed list of defects found and their percentages
   - An analysis of the potential causes of these defects
   - Recommendations for preventing or reducing these defects in future harvests
   - A discussion of how these defects might impact cup quality
6. Include photographs or diagrams to illustrate the defects identified.

Submit your report along with a small sample (10g) of the defective beans you identified, properly labeled and packaged.

## Flavor Wheel Exercise

1. Print out or display the SCA Flavor Wheel.
2. Provide students with a selection of food items representing different flavor notes (e.g., lemon, apple, cinnamon, chocolate, nuts).
3. Have students taste each item and practice identifying its location on the flavor wheel.
4. Discuss how these flavors might be expressed in coffee and how to describe them using the wheel's terminology.
