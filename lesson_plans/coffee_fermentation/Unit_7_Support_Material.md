# Support Material for Quality Control and Cupping Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Cupping**: A standardized method of sensory evaluation used to assess coffee quality
- **Defect**: An imperfection in green or roasted coffee that negatively affects quality
- **Primary defect**: Major flaws in coffee beans that significantly impact quality (e.g., full black beans, sour beans)
- **Secondary defect**: Minor flaws in coffee beans with less impact on quality (e.g., slight insect damage, partial quakers)
- **Flavor attributes**: Characteristics of coffee taste and aroma, such as acidity, body, and sweetness
- **Acidity**: The bright, tangy quality of coffee; not to be confused with sourness
- **Body**: The weight or thickness of the coffee in the mouth
- **Aroma**: The smell of the coffee, both as dry grounds and when brewed
- **Green coffee grading**: A system for classifying unroasted coffee beans based on size, density, and defect count
- **Roast profiling**: The process of controlling time and temperature during coffee roasting to achieve desired flavor characteristics
- **Dry fragrance**: The smell of the dry, ground coffee before water is added
- **Wet aroma**: The smell of the coffee immediately after hot water is added
- **Breaking the crust**: The act of breaking the top layer of grounds in a cupping bowl to release aromas
- **Flavor wheel**: A visual tool used to describe and categorize coffee flavors and aromas

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. SCA Flavor Wheel Diagram:
   - A large, circular diagram showing the hierarchy of coffee flavors
   - Primary categories in the center (e.g., fruity, sweet, floral)
   - Subcategories branching out (e.g., berry, citrus, chocolate)
   - Specific descriptors on the outer ring (e.g., blackberry, lemon, dark chocolate)

2. Coffee Defects Chart:
   - A table or grid showing common coffee defects
   - Columns: Defect name, Image, Description, Cause, Impact on quality
   - Include both green and roasted coffee defects

3. Cupping Setup Diagram:
   - Overhead view of a proper cupping table layout
   - Show placement of cupping bowls, spoons, rinse cups, and score sheets
   - Include labels and a legend explaining each element

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Coffee Defect Identification Worksheet:
   - List of 10-15 common defects with blank spaces for students to fill in
   - Columns: Defect name, Possible causes, Quality impact
   - Include a mix of green and roasted coffee defects

2. Cupping Form:
   - Based on the SCA cupping form
   - Categories: Fragrance/Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity, Clean Cup, Sweetness, Overall
   - Scoring scale from 6 to 10 with quarter-point increments
   - Space for taster's name, sample number, and descriptive notes

3. Flavor Wheel Practice Sheet:
   - Blank flavor wheel outline
   - Space for students to fill in flavors they identify during cupping
   - Section for noting intensity of each identified flavor

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Books:
   - "The Coffee Cupper's Handbook" by Ted R. Lingle
   - "The World Atlas of Coffee" by James Hoffmann

2. Online Resources:
   - SCA Coffee Standards: https://sca.coffee/research/coffee-standards
   - Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) Q Grader Courses: https://www.coffeeinstitute.org/

3. Videos:
   - "How to Cup Coffee" by European Coffee Trip (YouTube)
   - "Understanding Coffee Defects" by Cafe Imports (Vimeo)

4. Practice Tools:
   - Le Nez du Caf√© Aroma Kit for sensory training
   - Coffee Defect Kit from Coffee Enterprises

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling to identify specific flavors
   - Solution: Start with broader categories (e.g., fruity, nutty) before moving to specific descriptors. Use aroma samples or flavor references to help students connect scents/tastes to descriptors.

2. Challenge: Inconsistent cupping results among students
   - Solution: Emphasize the importance of following the standard protocol. Conduct group cuppings with discussions to calibrate palates and vocabulary.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in recognizing subtle defects
   - Solution: Provide exaggerated examples of defects alongside normal samples. Gradually introduce more subtle defects as students' skills improve.

4. Challenge: Sensory fatigue during long cupping sessions
   - Solution: Take regular breaks, provide palate cleansers (e.g., water, crackers), and limit the number of samples per session.

5. Challenge: Students becoming overwhelmed by the complexity of the flavor wheel
   - Solution: Introduce the flavor wheel gradually, starting with primary and secondary categories before delving into specific descriptors. Use practical exercises to reinforce understanding.

6. Challenge: Maintaining consistent water temperature during cupping
   - Solution: Use thermometers and temperature-stable kettles. Discuss the importance of temperature control and demonstrate proper pouring techniques.
