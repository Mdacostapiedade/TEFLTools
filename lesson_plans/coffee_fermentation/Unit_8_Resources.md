# Lecture Notes

## Environmental Impacts of Coffee Production

### Deforestation and Habitat Loss
- Coffee cultivation often leads to clearing of forests
- Loss of biodiversity and wildlife habitats
- Disruption of ecosystem services (e.g., water regulation, carbon sequestration)
- Examples: Central American cloud forests, Ethiopian highlands

### Water Pollution
- Runoff from chemical fertilizers and pesticides
- Contamination of local water sources
- Impacts on aquatic ecosystems and human health
- Case study: Lake Atitl√°n, Guatemala

### Soil Degradation
- Erosion due to removal of natural vegetation
- Depletion of soil nutrients through intensive farming
- Compaction from heavy machinery
- Long-term impacts on soil fertility and productivity

### Carbon Emissions
- Clearing of forests releases stored carbon
- Energy use in processing and transportation
- Methane emissions from waste pulp
- Coffee's contribution to agricultural greenhouse gas emissions

## Organic Farming Practices for Coffee

### Soil Conservation Techniques
- Contour planting to prevent erosion
- Use of cover crops to protect soil
- Terracing on steep slopes
- Minimal tillage practices

### Natural Pest Control Methods
- Biological control using natural predators
- Trap crops to divert pests
- Use of neem and other natural pesticides
- Importance of maintaining ecosystem balance

### Composting and Organic Fertilizers
- Coffee pulp composting techniques
- Use of animal manure and green manures
- Vermiculture for nutrient-rich compost
- Foliar sprays from fermented plant materials

### Shade-Grown Coffee Systems
- Benefits for biodiversity conservation
- Microclimate regulation
- Natural pest control through bird habitats
- Additional income from shade trees (e.g., fruit, timber)

## Fair Trade and Other Certification Schemes

### Principles of Fair Trade
- Guaranteed minimum price for farmers
- Social premium for community development
- Long-term trading relationships
- Pre-financing for farmers
- Transparency and accountability

### Organic Certification Process
- Transition period requirements
- Record-keeping and traceability
- Third-party auditing and inspection
- Costs and benefits for farmers

### Rainforest Alliance and Other Eco-Labels
- Comparison of different certification standards
- Focus areas: environmental, social, and economic
- Market demand for certified coffees
- Challenges in maintaining multiple certifications

### Benefits and Challenges of Certification
- Price premiums and market access
- Improved farm management practices
- Costs of compliance and certification
- Balancing standards with local realities

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Sustainability Plan for a Coffee Farm

1. Divide into groups of 3-4 students.
2. Imagine you are consultants hired to develop a sustainability plan for a 5-hectare coffee farm in Timor-Leste.
3. Your plan should address the following areas:
   - Soil conservation
   - Water management
   - Biodiversity protection
   - Pest control
   - Energy use
   - Waste management
   - Social sustainability (worker welfare, community relations)
   - Economic sustainability
4. For each area, provide at least two specific, actionable recommendations.
5. Consider the local context of Timor-Leste, including climate, topography, and available resources.
6. Your plan should be realistic and implementable within a 3-year timeframe.
7. Prepare a 1-page summary of your plan to present to the class.
8. Be prepared to justify your recommendations and discuss potential challenges in implementation.

# Assignment Details
