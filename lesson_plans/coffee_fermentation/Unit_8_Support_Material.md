## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may have limited exposure to sustainable farming practices
   Tip: Begin with basic concepts and gradually introduce more complex ideas. Use local examples whenever possible to make the content more relatable.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in visualizing long-term impacts of sustainable practices
   Tip: Use before-and-after case studies or time-lapse videos to illustrate the effects of sustainable practices over time.

3. Challenge: Balancing economic and environmental considerations
   Tip: Emphasize the long-term economic benefits of sustainable practices. Invite local farmers or cooperative representatives to share their experiences.

4. Challenge: Limited access to certified organic or fair trade products for demonstration
   Tip: If physical samples are unavailable, use high-quality images and detailed descriptions. Consider virtual farm tours or video demonstrations.

5. Challenge: Students may be overwhelmed by the complexity of certification schemes
   Tip: Focus on the core principles of each major certification type rather than detailed requirements. Use comparison charts to highlight key differences.

6. Challenge: Applying global sustainability concepts to the Timor-Leste context
   Tip: Encourage students to discuss how international sustainability practices can be adapted to local conditions. Highlight any existing sustainable coffee initiatives in Timor-Leste.
