# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Computer Networks

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts with network diagrams
- Colored paper and markers for group activities
- Internet access for research (if available)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define what a computer network is
- Explain the importance of networks in Timor-Leste's context
- Identify and describe different types of networks (LAN, MAN, WAN)
- Recognize basic network topologies (Bus, Star, Ring)

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to list all the ways they've used computer networks in the past week
- Discuss responses as a class, categorizing them into local and wide-area uses

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Network
- LAN (Local Area Network)
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- WAN (Wide Area Network)
- Topology
- Node

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### What is a Network?
- Definition and basic concepts
- Components of a network (nodes, connections, protocols)

### Importance of Networks in Timor-Leste
- Communication and information sharing
- Economic development
- Education and healthcare applications

### Network Types
- LAN: Definition, characteristics, examples in Timor-Leste
- MAN: Definition, characteristics, potential applications in Dili
- WAN: Definition, characteristics, examples (internet, government networks)

### Network Topologies
- Bus topology: Explanation and diagram
- Star topology: Explanation and diagram
- Ring topology: Explanation and diagram

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

### Activity 1: Network Type Identification
- Provide students with scenarios of different network setups
- Ask them to identify whether each is a LAN, MAN, or WAN and explain their reasoning

### Activity 2: Topology Matching
- Give students diagrams of different network topologies
- Have them match the diagrams to the correct topology names and list pros/cons of each

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

### Group Discussion: Networking in Timor-Leste
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group discusses and lists current applications and challenges of networking in Timor-Leste
- Groups present their findings to the class

### Network Design Activity
- In pairs, students create a simple network diagram for a local Timorese business (e.g., caf√©, small office)
- Students label network components and explain their choices

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Quick quiz: Students answer true/false questions about networks and topologies
- Address any remaining questions from students

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a one-page report on how improved networking could benefit a specific sector in Timor-Leste (e.g., education, healthcare, agriculture)
- Draw a diagram of your home or school network, identifying the type and topology used

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Network: A group of interconnected computers and devices that can communicate and share resources
- LAN (Local Area Network): A network that connects computers in a limited area such as a home, office, or small group of buildings
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): A network that spans a city or large campus, larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN
- WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that covers a large geographical area, often connecting multiple LANs across countries or continents
- Topology: The physical or logical layout of a network
- Node: Any device connected to a network, such as a computer, printer, or router
- Bus Topology: A network layout where all devices are connected to a single cable
- Star Topology: A network layout where all devices are connected to a central hub or switch
- Ring Topology: A network layout where devices are connected in a closed loop
