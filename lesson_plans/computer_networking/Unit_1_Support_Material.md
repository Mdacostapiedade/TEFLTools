# Support Material for Introduction to Computer Networks Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Network: A group of interconnected computers and devices that can communicate and share resources
- LAN (Local Area Network): A network that connects computers in a limited area such as a home, office, or small group of buildings
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): A network that spans a city or large campus, larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN
- WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that covers a large geographical area, often connecting multiple LANs across countries or continents
- Topology: The physical or logical layout of a network
- Node: Any device connected to a network, such as a computer, printer, or router
- Bus Topology: A network layout where all devices are connected to a single cable
- Star Topology: A network layout where all devices are connected to a central hub or switch
- Ring Topology: A network layout where devices are connected in a closed loop

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Network Types Diagram:
   - Description: A visual representation showing the scale and scope of LAN, MAN, and WAN networks. LAN depicted as a small office or home, MAN as a city with multiple buildings connected, and WAN as a map with connections across countries.

2. Network Topologies Diagrams:
   - Description: Three separate diagrams showing:
     a) Bus Topology: A straight line with multiple nodes connected directly to it
     b) Star Topology: A central hub with multiple nodes radiating out from it
     c) Ring Topology: A circular arrangement of nodes with connections forming a closed loop

3. Network Components Diagram:
   - Description: An illustration showing basic network components such as computers, servers, routers, switches, and the connections between them.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Network Type Identification Worksheet:
   - Content: A list of 10 scenarios describing different network setups. Students must identify whether each scenario describes a LAN, MAN, or WAN and explain their reasoning.

2. Topology Matching Activity:
   - Content: A page with unlabeled diagrams of bus, star, and ring topologies on one side, and a list of topology names and characteristics on the other. Students must match the diagrams to the correct names and list pros and cons of each.

3. Timor-Leste Networking Applications Brainstorming Sheet:
   - Content: A template with sections for different sectors (e.g., education, healthcare, government, business) where students can list current and potential applications of networking in Timor-Leste.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Online Resources:
   - Cisco Networking Basics: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/small-business/resource-center/networking/networking-basics.html
   - Computer Network Tutorials by Tutorialspoint: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_networking/index.htm

2. Books:
   - "Computer Networks" by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and David J. Wetherall
   - "Networking All-in-One For Dummies" by Doug Lowe

3. Interactive Learning:
   - Cisco Packet Tracer (if available): A network simulation tool for practice
   - GNS3: An open-source network simulation software

4. Local Resources:
   - Timor-Leste National Information and Communication Technology Policy (students can research this online)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Limited Access to Technology:
   - Challenge: Students may have limited experience with computer networks.
   - Solution: Use physical demonstrations and analogies to explain concepts. For example, use string and paper messages to demonstrate data transmission in different topologies.

2. Language Barriers:
   - Challenge: Technical terms may be difficult in English.
   - Solution: Provide a glossary in Tetum or Portuguese alongside English terms. Use visual aids extensively to support understanding.

3. Relevance to Local Context:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle to see the relevance of networking in Timor-Leste.
   - Solution: Consistently relate concepts to local examples and potential applications. Invite guest speakers from local IT companies or government departments if possible.

4. Varying Levels of Prior Knowledge:
   - Challenge: Students may have very different levels of familiarity with technology.
   - Solution: Use pair work and group activities to encourage peer learning. Provide additional resources for advanced students and extra support for those who need it.

5. Lack of Hands-on Equipment:
   - Challenge: Limited access to networking hardware for demonstrations.
   - Solution: Use software simulations where possible. Create paper-based activities that mimic network setups and data flow.
