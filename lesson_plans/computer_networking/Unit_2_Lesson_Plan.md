# Lesson Plan: Network Models and Protocols

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Printed handouts of OSI and TCP/IP models
- Network cables (Ethernet, fiber optic) for demonstration
- Packet capture software (e.g., Wireshark) if available

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the purpose and structure of the OSI and TCP/IP models
- Identify the layers in each model and their functions
- Understand the role of common protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP
- Compare and contrast the OSI and TCP/IP models

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to brainstorm in pairs about how they think information travels from one computer to another across the internet
- Have a few pairs share their ideas with the class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Protocol
- Layer
- Encapsulation
- Packet
- Header

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### OSI Model
- Introduce the 7 layers of the OSI model
- Explain the function of each layer
- Discuss the concept of encapsulation

### TCP/IP Model
- Present the 4 layers of the TCP/IP model
- Compare to the OSI model, highlighting similarities and differences
- Explain how the TCP/IP model relates to real-world networking

### Common Protocols
- Introduce HTTP, FTP, and SMTP
- Explain their purposes and which layer they operate on

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- Divide the class into small groups
- Distribute handouts with mixed-up descriptions of OSI and TCP/IP layers
- Have groups sort and match the descriptions to the correct layers

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- If resources allow, guide students through a basic packet capture using Wireshark
- Alternatively, provide a pre-captured packet trace and have students identify different protocol headers

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Conduct a quick quiz using an online tool like Kahoot! to test understanding of key concepts
- Address any remaining questions from students

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a one-page report on how one of the common protocols (HTTP, FTP, or SMTP) is used in a real-world application in Timor-Leste
- Prepare a simple diagram showing how data moves through the TCP/IP layers for sending an email

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Protocol: A set of rules that govern how data is transmitted between devices
- Layer: A level in a hierarchical structure of network protocols
- Encapsulation: The process of adding protocol information to data as it moves down the network layers
- Packet: A unit of data transmitted over a network
- Header: Information added to the beginning of a packet that contains protocol-specific data
- OSI Model: Open Systems Interconnection model, a conceptual framework used to describe network functions in seven layers
- TCP/IP Model: A four-layer model that describes how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received
- HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol, used for transmitting web pages
- FTP: File Transfer Protocol, used for transferring files between computers
- SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, used for sending email messages
