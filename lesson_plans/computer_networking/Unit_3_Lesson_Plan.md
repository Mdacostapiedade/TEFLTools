# Lesson Plan: Network Devices and Their Functions

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Computer with projector
- Sample network devices (hub, switch, router) if available
- Network cable samples (Ethernet, fiber optic)
- Handouts with diagrams of network devices
- Laptops or computers for student use (1 per 2-3 students)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify common network devices (hubs, switches, routers)
- Explain the basic functions of hubs, switches, and routers
- Differentiate between the operations of various network devices
- Understand the role of these devices in a local area network (LAN)

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display a simple network diagram on the projector
- Ask students to identify any devices they recognize
- Discuss as a class what they think each device might do

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Hub
- Switch
- Router
- Gateway
- Broadcast
- Collision domain
- Packet

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Hubs and Repeaters
- Definition and basic function
- How data is transmitted through a hub
- Limitations of hubs (collisions, broadcast domain)

### Switches and Bridges
- Definition and basic function
- Comparison to hubs
- MAC address table and how switches learn
- Benefits of switches over hubs

### Routers and Gateways
- Definition and basic function
- Role in connecting different networks
- IP addressing and routing tables
- Difference between routers and switches

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a set of network scenario cards
- Ask groups to identify which device would be most appropriate for each scenario and explain why

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

### Small LAN Setup
- If resources allow, guide students through setting up a small LAN using available devices
- If physical resources are limited, use a network simulation software to create a virtual LAN

### Research Task
- Assign students to research and report on network devices used in local Timorese institutions
- Students should identify at least one institution and list the types of network devices they use

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the main functions of hubs, switches, and routers
- Conduct a quick quiz using true/false statements about network devices
- Address any remaining questions from students

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Create a diagram of a home or small office network, including at least 3 different network devices
- Write a short paragraph explaining the function of each device in the network
- Research one additional network device not covered in class and prepare a brief presentation

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Hub: A basic networking device that broadcasts data to all connected devices
- Switch: A device that creates separate collision domains for each port and forwards data based on MAC addresses
- Router: A device that connects different networks and forwards data based on IP addresses
- Gateway: A node that serves as an entrance to another network
- Broadcast: Sending data to all devices on a network
- Collision domain: A network segment where data collisions can occur
- Packet: A unit of data transmitted over a network
