# Lesson Plan: Physical Media and Connectivity

## 1. Resources Needed

- Various network cable types (twisted pair, coaxial, fiber optic)
- Wi-Fi router
- Smartphone with cellular data
- Cable crimping tools and RJ45 connectors (if available)
- Projector or large display
- Handouts with diagrams of different cable types
- List of local ISPs and their offerings

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify and describe different types of network cables
- Explain the basic principles of wireless networking
- Compare various internet connectivity options available in Timor-Leste
- Demonstrate basic cable termination skills (if resources allow)

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show students various cable types and wireless devices
- Ask them to guess which might be faster or more reliable
- Discuss their experiences with different internet connection types in Timor-Leste

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Twisted pair
- Coaxial
- Fiber optic
- Wi-Fi
- Cellular network
- Bandwidth
- Latency

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Wired Media
- Explain twisted pair cables: structure, categories, uses
- Describe coaxial cables: structure, advantages, common applications
- Introduce fiber optic cables: principles, benefits, limitations

### Wireless Technologies
- Explain Wi-Fi: frequencies, standards (802.11), range
- Discuss cellular networks: generations (3G, 4G, 5G), coverage in Timor-Leste

### Connectivity Options in Timor-Leste
- Overview of available ISPs
- Comparison of services: DSL, fiber, mobile broadband, satellite

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- Cable identification quiz: students match cable types to descriptions
- Wi-Fi signal strength experiment: measure signal strength in different locations
- ISP comparison worksheet: students compare local ISP offerings

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Group task: Design an optimal network setup for a small Timorese business, considering available technologies
- Cable termination practice (if resources allow): Students attempt to terminate an Ethernet cable

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key concepts covered
- Open discussion on the future of connectivity in Timor-Leste

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a short report on the challenges and opportunities for expanding internet access in rural areas of Timor-Leste
- Survey family and friends about their internet connection types and satisfaction levels

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Twisted pair: A type of cable consisting of paired insulated copper wires twisted together
- Coaxial: A cable with an inner conductor surrounded by insulating layer and outer conducting shield
- Fiber optic: A cable using glass or plastic fibers to transmit data as pulses of light
- Wi-Fi: A wireless networking technology using radio waves to provide high-speed network and Internet connections
- Cellular network: A communication network distributed over land areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver
- Bandwidth: The maximum rate of data transfer across a given path
- Latency: The time delay between the moment something is initiated, and the moment its first effect begins
