## Wired Media

### Twisted Pair Cables
- Structure: Two insulated copper wires twisted together
- Categories: Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a, Cat7
- Uses: Ethernet networks, telephone systems
- Advantages: Inexpensive, easy to install
- Disadvantages: Limited bandwidth over long distances, susceptible to interference

### Coaxial Cables
- Structure: Inner conductor, insulating layer, metallic shield, outer jacket
- Types: RG-6, RG-59
- Uses: Cable television, internet, some Ethernet networks
- Advantages: Good shielding against interference, higher bandwidth than twisted pair
- Disadvantages: More expensive, less flexible than twisted pair

### Fiber Optic Cables
- Structure: Glass or plastic core, cladding, buffer coating, outer jacket
- Types: Single-mode, multi-mode
- Uses: High-speed internet, long-distance communication
- Advantages: Very high bandwidth, low signal loss, immune to electromagnetic interference
- Disadvantages: Expensive, requires specialized equipment for installation and repair

## Wireless Technologies

### Wi-Fi
- Based on IEEE 802.11 standards
- Frequencies: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz
- Common standards: 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)
- Range: Typically 30-50 meters indoors
- Advantages: Convenient, no wiring required
- Disadvantages: Can be affected by obstacles, potential security risks

### Cellular Networks
- Generations: 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G
- Coverage in Timor-Leste: Mainly 3G and 4G in urban areas
- Advantages: Wide coverage area, mobile access
- Disadvantages: Can be expensive, coverage may be limited in rural areas

## Connectivity Options in Timor-Leste

### DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
- Uses existing telephone lines
- Speeds typically up to 100 Mbps
- Available in some urban areas

### Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH)
- Limited availability, mainly in Dili
- Offers highest speeds (up to 1 Gbps)

### Mobile Broadband
- 3G and 4G services available
- Coverage mainly in urban areas and along main roads

### Satellite Internet
- Available throughout the country
- Higher latency, affected by weather
- Often used in remote areas with no other options

# Assignment Details

## ISP Comparison Project

1. Research at least three Internet Service Providers (ISPs) operating in Timor-Leste.

2. For each ISP, gather the following information:
   - Available service types (e.g., DSL, fiber, mobile broadband)
   - Speeds offered
   - Pricing plans
   - Coverage areas
   - Any additional services or features

3. Create a comparison table or matrix presenting this information clearly.

4. Write a 300-word analysis of your findings, addressing:
   - Which ISP offers the best value for different types of users (e.g., home, small business, large organization)
   - Gaps in service offerings or coverage
   - Recommendations for improving internet service in Timor-Leste

5. Prepare a 5-minute presentation of your findings to share with the class.

Submission: Submit your comparison table, written analysis, and presentation slides.
