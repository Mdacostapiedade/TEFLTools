# Support Material for Physical Media and Connectivity Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Twisted pair**: A type of cable consisting of paired insulated copper wires twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference.
- **Coaxial**: A cable with an inner conductor surrounded by an insulating layer and outer conducting shield, used for high-frequency signal transmission.
- **Fiber optic**: A cable using glass or plastic fibers to transmit data as pulses of light, offering high bandwidth and low signal loss.
- **Wi-Fi**: A wireless networking technology using radio waves to provide high-speed network and Internet connections.
- **Cellular network**: A communication network distributed over land areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver.
- **Bandwidth**: The maximum rate of data transfer across a given path, typically measured in bits per second.
- **Latency**: The time delay between the moment something is initiated and the moment its first effect begins, often crucial in network performance.
- **ISP**: Internet Service Provider, a company that provides Internet access to customers.
- **RJ45**: A standardized network interface connector commonly used for Ethernet cables.
- **Ethernet**: A family of computer networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LANs).

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Cable Type Comparison Chart:
   - A table comparing twisted pair, coaxial, and fiber optic cables
   - Columns: Cable Type, Structure, Bandwidth, Maximum Distance, Common Uses

2. Wi-Fi Signal Strength Diagram:
   - A floor plan of a typical building showing Wi-Fi signal strength in different areas
   - Use color coding to represent signal strength (e.g., green for strong, yellow for moderate, red for weak)

3. Cellular Network Generation Comparison:
   - Infographic comparing 3G, 4G, and 5G technologies
   - Include speed, latency, and typical applications for each generation

4. Timor-Leste Connectivity Map:
   - A map of Timor-Leste showing areas with different types of internet connectivity
   - Use color coding to represent different connection types (e.g., fiber, DSL, mobile broadband, satellite)

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Cable Identification Quiz:
   - Images of different cable types with blank spaces for students to fill in the names
   - Multiple-choice questions about cable characteristics and uses

2. ISP Comparison Worksheet:
   - Table with local ISPs listed in rows
   - Columns for services offered, speeds, prices, and coverage areas
   - Space for students to fill in information based on research or provided data

3. Network Design Challenge:
   - Scenario description of a small Timorese business needing a network setup
   - Blank network diagram for students to fill in with appropriate devices and connections
   - Questions prompting students to justify their design choices

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

4. Local Resources:
   - Timor-Leste National Communications Authority website
   - Reports from local telecom companies on network infrastructure

## 5. Tips for Teachers

1. Potential Challenges and Solutions:
   - Limited access to physical networking equipment:
     * Solution: Use virtual labs or simulations where possible. Create paper-based activities that mimic network setups.
   
   - Varying levels of prior knowledge among students:
     * Solution: Implement peer teaching. Pair more experienced students with those who need additional support.

   - Language barriers (if teaching in English):
     * Solution: Provide key terms in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids extensively to support understanding.

2. Contextualizing for Timor-Leste:
   - Emphasize technologies most relevant to the local context (e.g., mobile broadband may be more common than fiber optic in many areas).
   - Discuss challenges specific to Timor-Leste, such as mountainous terrain affecting wireless signal propagation.

3. Hands-on Learning:
   - If possible, arrange a field trip to a local ISP or telecom company to see network infrastructure in person.
   - Encourage students to conduct speed tests on their home or mobile connections and discuss the results in class.

4. Addressing the Digital Divide:
   - Discuss the implications of varying internet access across Timor-Leste and brainstorm potential solutions.
   - Assign projects that explore ways to improve connectivity in underserved areas.

5. Staying Current:
   - Keep informed about ongoing telecommunications projects in Timor-Leste to provide up-to-date examples.
   - Encourage students to follow tech news sources focused on Southeast Asia for the latest developments.
