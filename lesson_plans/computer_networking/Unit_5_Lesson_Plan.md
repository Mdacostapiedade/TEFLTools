# Lesson Plan: IP Addressing and Subnetting

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts with IP addressing exercises
- Network diagram templates
- Calculators (if not using computers)
- Access to online IP subnet calculator (optional)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the structure of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
- Identify IP address classes and their ranges
- Understand the concept of subnet masks
- Apply CIDR notation to represent IP addresses and subnets
- Perform basic subnetting calculations

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Display various IP addresses on the board and ask students to identify which are valid IPv4 addresses
- Brief discussion on why IP addressing is important for Timor-Leste's growing internet infrastructure

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- IP address
- Subnet
- Subnet mask
- CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
- Network ID
- Host ID

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduction to IP addressing
   - Purpose of IP addresses
   - Difference between IPv4 and IPv6

2. IPv4 address structure
   - 32-bit addresses
   - Dotted decimal notation

3. IP address classes
   - Class A, B, C, D, and E
   - Range of each class

4. Subnet masks
   - Purpose of subnet masks
   - Default subnet masks for each class

5. CIDR notation
   - Representation of IP addresses with subnet information
   - Examples of CIDR notation

6. Basic subnetting concepts
   - Why subnetting is necessary
   - How to create subnets

## 6. Practice Activities (25 minutes)

1. IP address classification exercise
   - Provide a list of IP addresses for students to classify

2. Subnet mask matching
   - Match subnet masks to appropriate network sizes

3. CIDR notation conversion
   - Convert between CIDR notation and traditional subnet mask notation

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Subnetting worksheet
   - Students perform subnetting calculations for a given network

2. Network design activity
   - In small groups, design an IP addressing scheme for a hypothetical government office in Dili, considering future growth

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick recap of key points
- Q&A session to address any confusion
- Brief discussion on how proper IP addressing and subnetting can benefit Timor-Leste's network infrastructure

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a short report on the current state of IP address allocation in Timor-Leste
2. Complete an advanced subnetting problem set
3. Create a simple network diagram for a small business, including IP addressing scheme

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- IP address: A unique numerical label assigned to each device in a computer network
- Subnet: A logical subdivision of an IP network
- Subnet mask: A 32-bit number that masks an IP address, dividing it into network and host portions
- CIDR: A method for allocating IP addresses and routing IP packets
- Network ID: The portion of an IP address that identifies the network
- Host ID: The portion of an IP address that identifies a specific device on the network
