# Lesson Plan: Network Security Basics

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with internet access for each student or pair of students
- Projector and screen
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on common network security threats and basic security measures
- Access to network simulation software (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer)
- Recent news articles on cybersecurity incidents in Southeast Asia

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify and describe common network security threats
- Explain the basic functions of a firewall
- Understand the importance of encryption in network security
- Describe the purpose of common security protocols like SSL/TLS
- Analyze a real-world cybersecurity incident
- Design a basic security plan for a small organization

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Present 5-7 multiple-choice questions about basic network concepts covered in previous lessons
- Discuss answers as a class to refresh knowledge and set the stage for new material

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Firewall
- Encryption
- Malware
- Phishing
- SSL/TLS
- Vulnerability
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Common Network Security Threats
- Malware (viruses, worms, trojans)
- Phishing and social engineering
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Man-in-the-Middle attacks

### Basic Security Measures
- Firewalls: types and functions
- Encryption: symmetric vs asymmetric
- Antivirus and anti-malware software
- Regular software updates and patch management

### Security Protocols
- SSL/TLS: purpose and basic functionality
- HTTPS and its importance for web security

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Group activity: Identify potential security vulnerabilities in a given network diagram
- Hands-on exercise: Configure basic firewall rules in network simulation software
- Pair work: Analyze and discuss a recent cybersecurity news article from Southeast Asia

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

- Case study analysis: In small groups, students analyze a recent cybersecurity incident in Southeast Asia
- Groups present their findings, including:
  * Nature of the attack
  * Vulnerabilities exploited
  * Impact on the affected organization
  * Lessons learned and preventive measures

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion: Key takeaways from the case study analysis
- Quick recap of main points covered in the lesson
- Q&A session for clarifications

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Design a basic security plan for a small Timorese organization (e.g., local NGO, small business)
- Plan should include:
  * Identification of potential security threats
  * Proposed security measures
  * Basic security policies for employees
  * Justification for chosen measures

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Firewall: A network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules
- Encryption: The process of encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it
- Malware: Software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system
- Phishing: A cybercrime in which targets are contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data
- SSL/TLS: Cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network
- Vulnerability: A weakness which can be exploited by a threat actor, such as an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a computer system
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS): A device or software application that monitors a network for malicious activity or policy violations
