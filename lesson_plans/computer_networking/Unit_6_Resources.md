# Lecture Notes

## Common Network Security Threats

### Malware
- Definition: Software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system
- Types:
  * Viruses: Self-replicating programs that attach to clean files and spread
  * Worms: Self-replicating programs that spread without user interaction
  * Trojans: Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software
- Impact: Data theft, system damage, unauthorized access

### Phishing and Social Engineering
- Definition: Techniques used to manipulate people into divulging sensitive information
- Common methods:
  * Email spoofing
  * Fake websites
  * Phone scams
- Prevention: User education, email filters, multi-factor authentication

### Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
- Definition: Attempts to overwhelm a system or network to make it unavailable
- Types:
  * Volumetric attacks
  * Protocol attacks
  * Application layer attacks
- Mitigation: Traffic filtering, increasing network capacity, using CDNs

### Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
- Definition: Interception of communication between two parties
- Methods:
  * ARP spoofing
  * DNS spoofing
  * Session hijacking
- Prevention: Encryption, secure protocols (HTTPS, SSL/TLS)

## Basic Security Measures

### Firewalls
- Definition: Network security devices that monitor and filter traffic
- Types:
  * Packet filtering firewalls
  * Stateful inspection firewalls
  * Application layer firewalls
- Functions:
  * Access control
  * Traffic monitoring and logging
  * Network Address Translation (NAT)

### Encryption
- Definition: Process of encoding information to protect its confidentiality
- Types:
  * Symmetric encryption: Same key for encryption and decryption
  * Asymmetric encryption: Public and private key pairs
- Applications:
  * Secure communication (HTTPS, VPNs)
  * Data storage protection

### Antivirus and Anti-malware Software
- Functions:
  * Scanning files and programs for known malware signatures
  * Behavioral analysis to detect suspicious activity
  * Regular updates to maintain effectiveness
- Importance of keeping software up-to-date

### Regular Software Updates and Patch Management
- Purpose: Address known vulnerabilities and improve security
- Best practices:
  * Implement automatic updates where possible
  * Test patches before widespread deployment
  * Maintain an inventory of all software and systems

## Security Protocols

### SSL/TLS
- Definition: Cryptographic protocols for secure communication over networks
- Evolution: SSL to TLS
- Key features:
  * Authentication
  * Confidentiality
  * Integrity

### HTTPS
- Definition: HTTP with encryption using SSL/TLS
- Importance:
  * Protects sensitive data during transmission
  * Verifies the identity of websites
  * Improves search engine rankings and user trust
