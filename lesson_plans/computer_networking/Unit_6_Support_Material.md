Here's the support material for the Network Security Basics lesson plan, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Network Security Basics Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Firewall**: A network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- **Encryption**: The process of encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it.
- **Malware**: Software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.
- **Phishing**: A cybercrime in which targets are contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data.
- **SSL/TLS**: Cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network.
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness which can be exploited by a threat actor, such as an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a computer system.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: A device or software application that monitors a network for malicious activity or policy violations.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**: An attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Network Security Threats Diagram**: 
   A flowchart showing common network security threats, their potential entry points, and their impacts on a network. Include icons for malware, phishing emails, DoS attacks, and MitM attacks.

2. **Firewall Illustration**: 
   A simple diagram showing a firewall as a barrier between an internal network and the internet, with arrows indicating allowed and blocked traffic.

3. **Encryption Process Visualization**: 
   A step-by-step illustration showing how data is encrypted, transmitted, and decrypted using both symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods.

4. **SSL/TLS Handshake Process**: 
   A sequence diagram showing the steps involved in establishing a secure SSL/TLS connection between a client and a server.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Network Security Threat Identification Worksheet**:
   - Provide a list of scenarios describing potential security threats.
   - Students identify the type of threat and suggest appropriate countermeasures.

2. **Firewall Rule Configuration Exercise**:
   - Present a network diagram with various devices and services.
   - Students write basic firewall rules to allow or block specific types of traffic.

3. **Encryption Puzzle**:
   - Create a simple substitution cipher exercise where students encrypt and decrypt messages.
   - Include questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this encryption method.

4. **Case Study Analysis Template**:
   - Provide a structured template for analyzing cybersecurity incidents, including sections for attack description, vulnerabilities exploited, impact assessment, and lessons learned.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Limited technical resources**: 
   - Use free, web-based network simulation tools if local software installation is not possible.
   - Encourage pair or group work to share available resources.

2. **Varying levels of prior knowledge**: 
   - Provide additional background reading materials for students who need extra support.
   - Use the warm-up quiz to identify and address knowledge gaps.

3. **Keeping up with rapidly evolving threats**: 
   - Regularly update lesson content with current news articles and case studies.
   - Encourage students to follow cybersecurity news sources.

4. **Making content relevant to Timor-Leste**: 
   - Research and incorporate local examples of cybersecurity challenges and initiatives.
   - Invite guest speakers from local IT departments or cybersecurity professionals.

5. **Language barriers**: 
   - Provide a glossary of technical terms in both English and Tetum.
   - Use visual aids and demonstrations to reinforce concepts.

6. **Lack of hands-on experience**: 
   - Utilize role-playing exercises to simulate security scenarios.
   - Organize field trips to local IT departments or cybersecurity firms, if possible.
