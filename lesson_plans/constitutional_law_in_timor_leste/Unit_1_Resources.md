## 1. Excerpts and Short Texts

### Excerpt from the Preamble of the Constitution of Timor-Leste

```
Following the liberation of the Timorese People from colonization and illegal occupation of the Maubere Motherland by foreign powers, the independence of East Timor, proclaimed on 28 November 1975 by Frente Revolucionária do Timor-Leste Independente (FRETILIN), is recognized internationally on 20 May 2002.

The preparation and adoption of the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of East Timor is the culmination of the historical resistance of the Timorese People, intensified following the invasion of 7 December 1975.

The struggle waged against the enemy, initially under the leadership of FRETILIN, gave way to more comprehensive forms of political participation, particularly in the wake of the establishment of the National Council of Maubere Resistance (CNRM) in 1987 and the National Council of Timorese Resistance (CNRT) in 1998.

The Resistance was divided into three fronts:

The armed front was pursued by the glorious Forças Armadas de Libertação Nacional de Timor-Leste (FALINTIL) whose historical undertaking is acknowledged by the Constitution;

The clandestine front, including the youth, social organizations, women, the clergy and other civil society entities, which, taking advantage of the occupier's contradictions, adopted a form of struggle in view of achieving independence;

The diplomatic front, carried out all over the world, enabled the paving of the way for definitive liberation.

In its cultural and humane perspective, the Catholic Church in East Timor has always been able to take on the suffering of all the People with dignity, placing itself on their side in the defense of their most fundamental rights.

Ultimately, the present Constitution represents a heart-felt tribute to all martyrs of the Motherland.

Thus, the Members of the Constituent Assembly, in their capacity as legitimate representatives of the People elected on 30 August 2001,

Based further on the results of the referendum of 30 August 1999 organized under the auspices of the United Nations which confirmed the self-determined will for independence;

Fully conscious of the need to build a democratic and institutional culture proper of a State based on the rule of law where respect for the Constitution, for the laws and for democratically elected institutions constitute its unquestionable foundation;

Interpreting the profound sentiments, the aspirations and the faith of the People of East Timor;

Solemnly reaffirm their determination to fight all forms of tyranny, oppression, social, cultural or religious domination and segregation, to defend national independence, to respect and guarantee human rights and the fundamental rights of the citizen, to ensure the principle of the separation of powers in the organization of the State, and to establish the essential rules of multi-party democracy, with a view to building a just and prosperous nation and developing a society of solidarity and fraternity.

The Constituent Assembly, meeting in plenary session on 22 March 2002, approves and decrees the following Constitution of the Democratic Republic of East Timor:

### Comparison of Constitutional Preambles

To provide context for Timor-Leste's constitutional preamble, here are excerpts from preambles of other post-conflict countries:

1. South Africa (1996):
```
We, the people of South Africa,
Recognise the injustices of our past;
Honour those who suffered for justice and freedom in our land;
Respect those who have worked to build and develop our country; and
Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity.
```

2. Rwanda (2003):
```
We, the People of Rwanda,
1° In the wake of the genocide that was organized and supervised by unworthy leaders and other perpetrators and that decimated more than a million sons and daughters of Rwanda;
2° Resolved to fight the ideology of genocide and all its manifestations and to eradicate ethnic, regional and any other form of divisions;
```

3. Bosnia and Herzegovina (1995):
```
Based on respect for human dignity, liberty, and equality,
Dedicated to peace, justice, tolerance, and reconciliation,
Convinced that democratic governmental institutions and fair procedures best produce peaceful relations within a pluralist society,
```

### Case Study: The Role of Public Participation in Constitution-Making

The constitution-making process in Timor-Leste involved significant public participation, which is considered a best practice in modern constitution-making. Here's a brief case study:

1. Context:
   - Timor-Leste emerging from long period of conflict and occupation
   - Limited experience with democratic governance
   - Diverse population with various ethnic and linguistic groups

2. Public Participation Mechanisms:
   - Constitutional Commission conducted civic education programs
   - Public hearings held in all 13 districts
   - Written submissions accepted from individuals and organizations
   - Thematic committees held additional consultations on specific topics

3. Challenges:
   - Limited time frame (less than a year for entire process)
   - Logistical difficulties in reaching remote areas
   - Low literacy rates in some regions
   - Balancing international best practices with local traditions

4. Outcomes:
   - Increased public awareness of constitutional issues
   - Greater legitimacy for the final document
   - Inclusion of provisions reflecting local concerns (e.g., recognition of customary law)

5. Lessons Learned:
   - Importance of civic education alongside consultation
   - Need for adequate time and resources for meaningful participation
   - Value of using multiple participation methods to reach diverse groups

This case study can be used to stimulate discussion on the importance of public participation in constitution-making and the challenges involved in the process.
