# Resources for Learning Unit 5: The Judiciary

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Structure of the Court System

- Timor-Leste's court system is hierarchical, consisting of:
  1. Supreme Court of Justice (highest court)
  2. Court of Appeal (intermediate appellate court)
  3. District Courts (courts of first instance)
  4. Military Courts (for military-specific cases)

- The Supreme Court of Justice:
  - Highest court in the country
  - Responsible for constitutional matters and final appeals
  - Composed of at least five judges

- The Court of Appeal:
  - Hears appeals from District Courts
  - Can also hear certain cases as a court of first instance

- District Courts:
  - Located in various districts throughout the country
  - Handle most criminal and civil cases
  - Specialized sections may exist (e.g., for serious crimes)

### Powers of the Supreme Court of Justice

- Constitutional review (both abstract and concrete)
- Final appeals in civil, criminal, and administrative cases
- Resolving jurisdictional conflicts between courts
- Verifying the constitutionality of referendums
- Reviewing the legality of political parties and coalitions

### Constitutional Review Processes

1. Abstract Review:
   - Can be requested by the President, Parliament, Prime Minister, or Prosecutor General
   - Reviews the constitutionality of laws before they are promulgated

2. Concrete Review:
   - Arises from actual cases in lower courts
   - Lower court judges can refer constitutional questions to the Supreme Court

3. Process:
   - Issue is brought before the court
   - Parties submit arguments
   - Court deliberates and issues a ruling
   - Decisions on constitutionality are binding on all courts and authorities

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How does the structure of Timor-Leste's court system contribute to the rule of law?
2. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of having the Supreme Court responsible for both constitutional matters and final appeals?
3. How might the power of constitutional review impact the relationship between the judiciary and other branches of government?
4. In what ways does the constitutional review process in Timor-Leste differ from other countries you're familiar with?
5. How might the composition of the Supreme Court affect its decision-making in constitutional cases?
