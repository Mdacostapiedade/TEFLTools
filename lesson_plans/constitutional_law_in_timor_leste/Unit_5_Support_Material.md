## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may struggle with legal terminology
   - Solution: Provide a glossary of terms and use simple language to explain complex concepts. Encourage students to create their own definitions in their words.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in understanding the abstract concept of judicial independence
   - Solution: Use real-world examples and case studies to illustrate the importance of judicial independence. Conduct a role-playing activity where students act out scenarios involving judicial decision-making under pressure.

3. Challenge: Limited access to up-to-date information on Timor-Leste's judiciary
   - Solution: Collaborate with local legal professionals or NGOs to obtain current information. Encourage students to follow news about the judiciary and bring in relevant articles for discussion.

4. Challenge: Students may find the constitutional review process complex
   - Solution: Break down the process into simple steps. Use visual aids like flowcharts and conduct a simplified mock constitutional review exercise in class.

5. Challenge: Engaging students in what might seem like a dry topic
   - Solution: Use interactive methods such as debates, moot courts, and group discussions. Relate judicial decisions to current events or issues that directly affect students' lives.
