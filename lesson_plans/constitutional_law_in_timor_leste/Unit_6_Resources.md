## 6. Additional Materials

### Example: Constitutional Court Decision (hypothetical)

```
Case No. 05/2022
In the matter of freedom of assembly and public health restrictions

The Constitutional Court of Timor-Leste has ruled that temporary restrictions on public gatherings imposed during a health emergency are constitutional, provided they are proportionate and time-limited.

The Court found that while the right to freedom of assembly is fundamental to democracy, it can be subject to limitations necessary to protect public health. The Court emphasized that any such restrictions must be:

1. Based on scientific evidence
2. Applied equally to all types of gatherings
3. Regularly reviewed and lifted as soon as the health situation allows

The Court struck down provisions of the emergency decree that gave authorities open-ended power to ban gatherings, ruling that specific criteria and time limits must be included in any such measures.

This example can be used to illustrate how courts balance competing rights and interests in constitutional interpretation.
