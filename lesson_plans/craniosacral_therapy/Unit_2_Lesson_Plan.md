# Lesson Plan: Assessment Techniques in Craniosacral Therapy

## Resources Needed

- Massage tables or mats
- Anatomical models of the skull and spine
- Handouts with diagrams of listening stations
- Journals for students
- Whiteboard and markers

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Locate and palpate the 10 primary listening stations
2. Assess the craniosacral rhythm
3. Identify basic restrictions in the craniosacral system

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Pair students and have them take turns palpating each other's pulse at different locations (wrist, neck, temple). Discuss how pulse feels different at various sites.

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Listening station
- Craniosacral rhythm
- Restriction
- Palpation
- Amplitude
- Symmetry

Define terms and provide examples, using anatomical models where appropriate.

## Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduction to listening stations
   - Define purpose and importance
   - Demonstrate locations on anatomical model

2. Assessing craniosacral rhythm
   - Explain components: rate, amplitude, symmetry, quality
   - Demonstrate palpation technique

3. Identifying restrictions
   - Describe characteristics of restrictions
   - Explain relationship to craniosacral rhythm

## Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Listening station location (20 minutes)
   - In pairs, students practice locating listening stations on each other
   - Instructor circulates to provide guidance and feedback

2. Craniosacral rhythm assessment (25 minutes)
   - Students practice palpating craniosacral rhythm at different stations
   - Record observations in journals

## Production Task (30 minutes)

Small group activity: Each group creates a simple diagram of the listening stations, labeling each and noting key palpation points. Groups present their diagrams to the class.

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Q&A session addressing student questions
- Quick quiz on listening station locations and rhythm assessment
- Recap key points of the lesson

## Homework Assignment

1. Practice locating listening stations and assessing craniosacral rhythm on 2-3 volunteers (family/friends)
2. Journal entries describing observations from practice sessions
3. Read provided handout on common craniosacral restrictions

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Listening station: Specific anatomical locations used to assess the craniosacral system
- Craniosacral rhythm: The subtle, rhythmic movement of cerebrospinal fluid within the craniosacral system
- Restriction: An area of reduced mobility or motility within the craniosacral system
- Palpation: The use of touch to examine the body
- Amplitude: The strength or intensity of the craniosacral rhythm
- Symmetry: The balance of the craniosacral rhythm between left and right sides of the body
