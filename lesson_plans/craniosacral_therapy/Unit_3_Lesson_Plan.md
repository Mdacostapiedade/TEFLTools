# Lesson Plan: Basic Treatment Techniques

## Resources Needed
- Massage tables or mats
- Anatomical models of the skull and spine
- Handouts with diagrams of still point induction and diaphragm release techniques
- Whiteboard and markers
- "An Introduction to Craniosacral Therapy" by Don Cohen (adapted and translated sections)

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain the concept of still point induction
2. Demonstrate basic diaphragm release techniques
3. Identify contraindications for craniosacral therapy
4. Perform a basic client intake assessment

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Pair students and have them take turns palpating each other's craniosacral rhythm at different listening stations
- Discuss observations as a group

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)
- Write key terms on the whiteboard: still point, diaphragm release, contraindication, palpation
- Explain each term using simple language and culturally relevant examples
- Have students repeat the terms and provide their own examples

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)
1. Still Point Induction
   - Explain the concept and purpose of still point induction
   - Demonstrate the technique on a volunteer
   - Discuss potential effects and benefits

2. Diaphragm Releases
   - Explain the importance of diaphragm releases in craniosacral therapy
   - Demonstrate pelvic, respiratory, and thoracic inlet diaphragm releases
   - Discuss how these techniques relate to traditional Timorese healing practices

3. Contraindications and Safety
   - Present a list of contraindications for craniosacral therapy
   - Discuss the importance of proper client screening
   - Relate contraindications to local health concerns in Timor-Leste

## Practice Activities (60 minutes)
1. Still Point Induction Practice (30 minutes)
   - Divide students into pairs
   - Have them practice still point induction on each other
   - Circulate to provide feedback and answer questions

2. Diaphragm Release Practice (30 minutes)
   - In the same pairs, have students practice pelvic and respiratory diaphragm releases
   - Encourage students to communicate their experiences as both practitioner and client

## Production Task (30 minutes)
- Role-playing exercise: Client Intake and Contraindication Screening
  * Divide students into groups of three (practitioner, client, observer)
  * Provide scenario cards with potential client histories
  * Have students practice conducting a client intake, identifying potential contraindications
  * Rotate roles to allow each student to practice being the practitioner

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Lead a group discussion on key learnings from the practice sessions
- Address any questions or concerns that arose during the activities
- Briefly review the main points of still point induction and diaphragm releases

## Homework Assignment
1. Read the provided translated excerpt on cranial bone mobilization from "An Introduction to Craniosacral Therapy"
2. Write a short reflection (1-2 paragraphs) on how craniosacral therapy techniques might complement traditional healing practices in their community

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Still point: A therapeutic pause in the craniosacral rhythm, induced by the practitioner to promote relaxation and healing
- Diaphragm release: A technique used to release tension in the body's major diaphragms (pelvic, respiratory, thoracic inlet)
- Contraindication: A condition or factor that serves as a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment due to the harm it would cause the patient
- Palpation: The use of touch in a medical examination or treatment
