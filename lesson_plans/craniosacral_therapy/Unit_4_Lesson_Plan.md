# Lesson Plan: The Dural Tube and Sacrum

## 1. Resources Needed

- Anatomical models of the spine and sacrum
- Massage tables or mats
- Handouts with diagrams of the dural tube and sacrum
- Whiteboard and markers
- "An Introduction to Craniosacral Therapy" by Don Cohen (translated excerpts)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe the anatomy and function of the dural tube
- Explain the relationship between the dural tube and sacrum
- Perform basic palpation of the sacrum and dural tube
- Demonstrate a sacral decompression technique

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Pair discussion: Students share their experiences with back pain or sacral discomfort, either personal or from treating others. Discuss any traditional Timorese remedies used for these issues.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Dural tube
- Sacrum
- Cerebrospinal fluid
- Decompression
- Traction

Use visual aids and anatomical models to reinforce understanding.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Anatomy of the dural tube
   - Structure and function
   - Relationship to cerebrospinal fluid

2. Sacral anatomy and its connection to the dural tube
   - Bony landmarks
   - Nerve roots

3. The importance of sacral mobility in craniosacral therapy
   - Impact on overall body function
   - Common restrictions and their effects

4. Introduction to sacral assessment techniques
   - Visual observation
   - Palpation methods

5. Overview of sacral decompression technique
   - Purpose and benefits
   - Basic hand positions and movements

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Palpation exercise (20 minutes):
   - In pairs, students practice locating sacral landmarks
   - Feeling for sacral mobility and restrictions

2. Dural tube sensing (25 minutes):
   - Guided visualization of the dural tube
   - Gentle palpation along the spine to sense dural tube tension

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

Sacral decompression technique practice:
- Instructor demonstration
- Students practice in pairs, with instructor supervision
- Feedback and adjustment of technique

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Q&A session addressing student questions
- Brief review of key points covered in the lesson
- Students share one new insight they gained during the class

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Read provided translated excerpts from "An Introduction to Craniosacral Therapy" focusing on the dural tube and sacrum.
2. Practice sacral palpation on 2-3 willing family members or friends, noting any differences observed.
3. Write a short reflection (1 page) on how understanding the dural tube and sacrum might complement traditional Timorese healing practices.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Dural tube: The membrane surrounding the spinal cord that contains cerebrospinal fluid
- Sacrum: The large triangular bone at the base of the spine
- Cerebrospinal fluid: Clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, providing protection and nutrition
- Decompression: The act of releasing pressure or tension from a body part
- Traction: A gentle pulling force applied to a body part, often to relieve pressure or align structures
