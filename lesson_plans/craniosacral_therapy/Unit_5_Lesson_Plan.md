# Lesson Plan: Cranial Vault Techniques

## Resources Needed
- Anatomical models of the skull
- Massage tables or mats
- Handouts with diagrams of cranial bones
- Whiteboard and markers
- "An Introduction to Craniosacral Therapy" by Don Cohen (adapted sections)

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify and locate the main bones of the cranial vault
2. Perform basic frontal and parietal lifts
3. Demonstrate a sphenoid decompression technique
4. Execute basic temporal bone techniques
5. Integrate local health beliefs into craniosacral approach

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Pair share: Students discuss any traditional head massage techniques they know from Timorese culture

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)
- Introduce and explain:
  - Cranial vault
  - Frontal bone
  - Parietal bones
  - Sphenoid
  - Temporal bones
  - Decompression
  - Sutures

## Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)
1. Overview of cranial vault anatomy (15 minutes)
   - Use skull model to show locations and relationships of bones
   - Explain sutures and their importance in craniosacral therapy
2. Demonstration of techniques (30 minutes)
   - Frontal lift
   - Parietal lift
   - Sphenoid decompression
   - Temporal bone techniques

## Practice Activities (60 minutes)
1. Paired practice: Students take turns performing each technique on a partner
2. Instructor circulates to provide feedback and corrections

## Production Task (30 minutes)
- Small group case study discussions:
  - Groups are given a scenario involving a local patient with head discomfort
  - They must create a treatment plan incorporating cranial vault techniques and local healing practices

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Class discussion: Share insights from case studies
- Quick review of key points for each technique

## Homework Assignment
1. Practice each technique for 15 minutes daily
2. Write a reflection on how cranial vault techniques might complement traditional Timorese healing practices

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Frontal bone: The bone that forms the forehead and upper part of the eye sockets
- Parietal bones: The two bones that form the sides and top of the skull
- Sphenoid: A butterfly-shaped bone at the base of the skull
- Temporal bones: The bones on the sides of the skull that house the ear structures
- Decompression: The act of releasing pressure or tension
- Sutures: The fibrous joints between the bones of the skull
