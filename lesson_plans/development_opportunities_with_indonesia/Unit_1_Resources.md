## Rationale for Cross-Border Cooperation

1. Geographic proximity
   - Shared land border on Timor island
   - Short sea distances between islands

2. Complementary resources and skills
   - Timor-Leste: Oil and gas expertise, emerging tourism sector
   - NTT: Agricultural production, livestock management

3. Potential for economies of scale
   - Joint infrastructure projects
   - Shared tourism promotion

4. Historical and cultural ties
   - Similar ethnic groups and languages
   - Shared colonial history

## Introduction to Key Sectors for Cooperation

### Tourism Sector
- "One Island, Two Nations" concept
  * Promoting Timor island as a single destination

  * Cross-border tour packages
  * Cultural and eco-tourism initiatives

### Livestock Sector
- Current state:
  * Timor-Leste: Small-scale production, limited export capacity
  * NTT: Larger production, established markets in Java

## Case Study: Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program

The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program is a successful example of cross-border cooperation in Southeast Asia. Established in 1992, the program involves six countries: Cambodia, China (specifically Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region), Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Key features of the GMS program:

1. Focus on connectivity: Development of economic corridors linking major cities and ports in the region.

2. Cross-border tourism initiatives: Joint marketing campaigns, multi-country tour packages, and streamlined visa processes.

3. Agriculture and food security: Cooperation on food safety standards, pest management, and cross-border value chains.

4. Energy cooperation: Development of a regional power grid and promotion of renewable energy.

5. Human resource development: Cross-border education and training programs.

Lessons for Timor-Leste and Indonesia:

- Importance of long-term commitment and vision
- Value of starting with "low-hanging fruit" projects to build trust and momentum
- Need for strong institutional frameworks to support cooperation
- Benefits of involving multiple stakeholders, including private sector and civil society
