## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language barriers:
   - Provide key terms in both English and Tetum/Bahasa Indonesia
   - Encourage students to work in mixed language groups to support each other

2. Limited prior knowledge of economic concepts:
   - Start with basic definitions and gradually introduce more complex ideas
   - Use real-life examples and case studies to illustrate abstract concepts

3. Sensitivity around historical tensions:
   - Focus on the potential for future cooperation rather than dwelling on past conflicts
   - Emphasize mutual benefits and shared goals

4. Varying levels of familiarity with the local context:
   - Conduct a brief pre-assessment to gauge students' knowledge of Timor-Leste and NTT
   - Provide additional background reading for those less familiar with the region

5. Engaging students with different learning styles:
   - Incorporate a mix of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic activities
   - Vary between individual, pair, and group work to cater to different preferences

6. Limited access to up-to-date information:
   - Provide a curated list of reliable online resources
   - Invite guest speakers from relevant government agencies or NGOs to share current insights

7. Overcoming skepticism about cross-border cooperation:
   - Present concrete examples of successful initiatives from other regions
   - Encourage critical thinking and open discussion about both benefits and challenges

8. Maintaining a balance between theory and practical application:
   - Incorporate role-playing exercises and simulations to apply concepts in realistic scenarios
   - Assign projects that require students to engage with local stakeholders or conduct field research
