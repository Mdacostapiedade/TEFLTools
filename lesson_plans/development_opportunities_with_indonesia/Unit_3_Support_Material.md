2. **Difficulty understanding technical terms**:
   - Provide clear definitions and examples for all technical terms
   - Use visual aids to illustrate complex concepts

3. **Lack of awareness about cross-border opportunities**:
   - Share success stories from other regions with similar cross-border initiatives
   - Invite guest speakers with experience in cross-border trade or cooperation

4. **Challenges in group work**:
   - Assign roles within groups to ensure equal participation
   - Provide clear guidelines and expectations for group projects

5. **Limited access to up-to-date information**:
   - Prepare handouts with recent statistics and information
   - Encourage students to conduct interviews with local farmers or officials as part of their research

6. **Difficulty in relating classroom learning to real-world scenarios**:
   - Incorporate case studies and role-playing exercises
   - Organize field visits to livestock markets or farms when possible

7. **Potential sensitivity around cross-border issues**:
   - Emphasize the mutual benefits of cooperation
