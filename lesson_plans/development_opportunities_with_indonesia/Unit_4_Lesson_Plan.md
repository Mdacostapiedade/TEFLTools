# Lesson Plan: Transport Connectivity and Trade Facilitation

## 1. Resources Needed

- Copies of relevant sections from "Enhanced Cooperation and Integration between Indonesia and Timor-Leste: Scoping Study" (ADB, 2019)
- Maps of Timor-Leste and Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) showing transport routes
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts with border crossing procedures
- Role-play cards for simulation exercise

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Analyze the current state of transport infrastructure between Timor-Leste and NTT
- Identify key challenges in cross-border movement of goods and people
- Explain international best practices in trade facilitation
- Develop strategies to improve a specific transport corridor
- Demonstrate understanding of border crossing procedures through a simulation exercise

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show a map of Timor-Leste and NTT on the projector
- Ask students to identify and discuss in pairs:
  1. Main transport routes between the two regions
  2. Potential bottlenecks or challenges in cross-border movement

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Trade facilitation
- Border control post
- Customs clearance
- Sanitary and phytosanitary measures
- Intermodal transportation

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of current road, sea, and air connectivity between Timor-Leste and NTT
- Explanation of existing border control procedures
- Discussion of key challenges in cross-border movement:
  1. Infrastructure limitations
  2. Regulatory barriers
  3. Lack of coordination between agencies
- Introduction to international best practices in trade facilitation:
  1. Single window systems
  2. Risk management approaches
  3. Harmonization of standards and procedures

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### 6.1 Group Analysis Exercise
- Divide students into small groups
- Assign each group a specific transport mode (road, sea, or air)
- Groups analyze current state and challenges of their assigned mode using the ADB study
- Groups present findings to the class

### 6.2 Case Study Discussion
- Present a case study of successful trade facilitation reforms in another country
- Facilitate class discussion on lessons learned and applicability to Timor-Leste

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

### 7.1 Simulation Exercise: Streamlining Border Crossing Procedures
- Divide class into roles: customs officers, traders, transport operators
- Provide role-play cards with specific scenarios
- Students act out current border crossing procedures
- Debrief and discuss ways to improve efficiency

### 7.2 Action Plan Development
- In small groups, students develop an action plan for improving a specific transport corridor between Timor-Leste and NTT
- Groups present their plans to the class for feedback

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Quick quiz on main concepts covered

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will:
1. Research and write a 2-page report on a specific trade facilitation measure that could be implemented between Timor-Leste and Indonesia
2. Prepare a 5-minute presentation on their proposed measure for the next class

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Trade facilitation: The simplification, modernization, and harmonization of export and import processes
- Border control post: A designated point where goods and people cross international borders
- Customs clearance: The process of complying with customs regulations to allow goods to enter or leave a country
- Sanitary and phytosanitary measures: Regulations to protect human, animal, or plant life or health from risks arising from the entry or spread of pests, diseases, or contaminants
- Intermodal transportation: The use of two or more modes of transport in an integrated manner in a door-to-door transport chain
