# Lecture Notes

## Road, Sea, and Air Connectivity between Timor-Leste and NTT

### Road Connectivity
- Main border crossings: Batugade-Mota'ain, Salele-Wini, Oesilo-Bobometo
- Condition of roads leading to border crossings
- Planned road improvement projects

### Sea Connectivity
- Main ports: Dili (Timor-Leste), Kupang (NTT)
- Current maritime routes and frequency of services
- Challenges in port infrastructure and management

### Air Connectivity
- Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport (Dili)
- El Tari International Airport (Kupang)
- Current flight routes and frequencies
- Potential for new air links

## Border Control Procedures and Challenges

### Current Procedures
- Documentation requirements for goods and people
- Inspection processes
- Customs clearance steps

### Common Challenges
- Long waiting times
- Lack of coordination between agencies
- Inadequate infrastructure at border posts
- Limited use of technology in border management

## International Best Practices in Trade Facilitation

### Single Window Systems
- Definition and benefits
- Examples from other countries (e.g., Singapore, South Korea)

### Risk Management Approaches
- Selective inspections based on risk profiles
- Use of non-intrusive inspection technologies

### Harmonization of Standards and Procedures
- Importance of aligning with international standards
- Regional cooperation initiatives (e.g., ASEAN Single Window)

# Discussion Questions

1. What are the most significant bottlenecks in transport connectivity between Timor-Leste and NTT? How can these be addressed?

2. How does the current state of transport infrastructure impact trade and economic cooperation between the two regions?

3. What are the potential benefits and challenges of implementing a single window system for Timor-Leste's border procedures?

4. How can risk management approaches improve efficiency at border crossings without compromising security?

5. What role can technology play in enhancing trade facilitation between Timor-Leste and NTT?

6. How might improved transport connectivity and trade facilitation impact local communities on both sides of the border?

7. What lessons can Timor-Leste learn from other countries' experiences in implementing trade facilitation measures?

8. How can Timor-Leste and Indonesia collaborate to harmonize their border procedures and standards?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Action Plan Development

1. Choose a specific transport corridor between Timor-Leste and NTT (e.g., Dili-Kupang sea route, Batugade-Mota'ain road crossing).

2. Analyze the current state of the chosen corridor, including infrastructure, procedures, and challenges.

3. Develop a detailed action plan to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the corridor. Your plan should include:
   - Specific objectives
   - Proposed interventions or improvements
   - Timeline for implementation
   - Required resources (financial, human, technical)
   - Potential challenges and mitigation strategies
   - Expected outcomes and benefits

4. Write a 2-3 page report outlining your action plan, including justifications for your proposed measures.

5. Prepare a brief presentation (5-7 minutes) to share your action plan with the class.

# Assignment Details

## Research Report on Trade Facilitation Measure

1. Choose a specific trade facilitation measure that could be implemented between Timor-Leste and Indonesia (e.g., electronic customs declaration system, joint border patrols, simplified visa procedures for business travelers).

2. Research the chosen measure, including:
   - Definition and key components
   - Examples of successful implementation in other countries
   - Potential benefits for Timor-Leste and Indonesia
   - Challenges in implementation
   - Required resources and timeline

3. Write a 2-page report (single-spaced, 12-point font) summarizing your findings and recommending how the measure could be adapted for the Timor-Leste-Indonesia context.

4. Include at least 3 credible sources in your research, properly cited.

5. Prepare a 5-minute presentation on your proposed measure for the next class, including visual aids (e.g., PowerPoint slides, handouts).

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Singapore's TradeNet System

Singapore's TradeNet system is a single window platform that allows traders to submit customs declarations and other trade documents electronically. Implemented in 1989, it has significantly reduced processing times and costs for traders.

Key features:
- 24/7 electronic submission of declarations
- Automated risk assessment and clearance
- Integration with other government agencies
- Reduced processing time from 2-4 days to 10 minutes

Discuss how elements of this system could be adapted for use in Timor-Leste, considering the country's specific context and challenges.

## Sample Border Crossing Procedure Flowchart

[Insert a flowchart here showing the typical steps involved in crossing the border between Timor-Leste and Indonesia, including documentation checks, inspections, and customs clearance]

Use this flowchart as a basis for the simulation exercise, identifying points where procedures could be streamlined or improved.

## Relevant Excerpts from ADB Scoping Study

[Insert key passages from the "Enhanced Cooperation and Integration between Indonesia and Timor-Leste: Scoping Study" (ADB, 2019) that discuss transport connectivity and trade facilitation challenges and opportunities]

Students should refer to these excerpts when analyzing current conditions and developing their action plans.
