5. Asian Development Bank's "Aid for Trade in Asia and the Pacific" reports

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may lack practical experience with cross-border trade procedures.
   Solution: Organize a field trip to a border crossing or invite guest speakers from customs or logistics companies.

2. Challenge: The technical nature of trade facilitation concepts may be difficult for some students.
   Solution: Use real-life examples and case studies to illustrate concepts. Encourage students to relate the material to their own experiences or local businesses.

3. Challenge: Students may struggle to see the relevance of international best practices to Timor-Leste's context.
   Solution: Facilitate discussions on how to adapt global practices to local conditions. Encourage critical thinking about the feasibility and potential impact of different measures.

4. Challenge: The simulation exercise may be chaotic or unrealistic.
   Solution: Provide clear instructions and role cards. Consider doing a practice run with a small group before the full class simulation. Debrief thoroughly to connect the exercise to real-world challenges.

5. Challenge: Students may have varying levels of familiarity with the geography of Timor-Leste and NTT.
   Solution: Spend extra time on the map activity at the beginning of the lesson. Provide additional maps or geographic resources for reference throughout the class.
