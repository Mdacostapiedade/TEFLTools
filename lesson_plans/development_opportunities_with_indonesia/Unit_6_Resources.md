## Case Study: Oe-Cusse Special Economic Zone

The Oe-Cusse Special Economic Zone (ZEESM) in Timor-Leste provides an interesting case study for cross-border cooperation and community engagement. Located in an exclave surrounded by Indonesian territory, Oe-Cusse faces unique challenges and opportunities for development.

Key points to consider:
- Special autonomous status within Timor-Leste
- Focus on tourism and agriculture development
- Cross-border infrastructure projects with NTT
- Community engagement challenges and successes
- Environmental and cultural preservation efforts

Students should research the ZEESM initiative and be prepared to discuss its relevance to the themes of community engagement and sustainable development in cross-border contexts.
