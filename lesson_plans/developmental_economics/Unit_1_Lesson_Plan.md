# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Experimental Approach in Development Economics

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts with case study materials
- Copies of relevant sections from "Poor Economics" by Banerjee and Duflo
- Recent economic data on Timor-Leste from World Bank or ADB reports

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the evolution of development economics research
- Define and describe randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
- Identify key development challenges in Timor-Leste
- Analyze a case study of an RCT in a developing country context

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick-write: Students spend 5 minutes writing down what they know about Timor-Leste's economy and development challenges
- Pair-share: Students discuss their ideas with a partner for 3 minutes
- Class discussion: Instructor facilitates a 2-minute sharing of key points

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
- Development economics
- Poverty alleviation
- Experimental approach
- Control group
- Treatment group

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Brief overview of traditional approaches to development economics (10 minutes)
- Introduction to the experimental approach and RCTs (10 minutes)
- Explanation of how RCTs are applied in development economics (10 minutes)

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Small group discussion: Students form groups of 3-4 to discuss Timor-Leste's development challenges, using the information from the warm-up and additional data provided (15 minutes)
- Group presentations: Each group presents their top 3 development challenges to the class (15 minutes)

## 7. Production Task (40 minutes)

Case study analysis:
- Students read a provided case study of a successful RCT in a developing country (15 minutes)
- In pairs, students answer guided questions about the case study, focusing on methodology, results, and potential applications to Timor-Leste (15 minutes)
- Class discussion of case study findings and implications (10 minutes)

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: 5 multiple-choice questions on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Review answers as a class
- Address any remaining questions or concerns

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Read Chapter 1 of "Poor Economics" by Banerjee and Duflo
- Write a 500-word reflection on how the experimental approach could be applied to address one of Timor-Leste's development challenges discussed in class
