## Evolution of Development Economics Research

### Traditional Approaches
- Macro-level focus on economic growth and industrialization
- Emphasis on capital accumulation and technology transfer
- Structural adjustment programs of the 1980s and 1990s
- Limitations: often failed to address root causes of poverty

### Shift to Micro-level Analysis
- Growing recognition of the complexity of poverty
- Focus on understanding individual and household decision-making
- Increased attention to social and cultural factors
- Rise of behavioral economics in development studies

### Emergence of the Experimental Approach
- Influenced by medical research methodologies
- Aim to establish causal relationships in development interventions
- Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) as the gold standard
- Pioneered by researchers like Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer

## Introduction to Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)

### Definition and Key Components
- Scientific experiment that randomly assigns participants to control and treatment groups
- Control group: receives no intervention or standard practice
- Treatment group: receives the intervention being tested
- Random assignment helps eliminate selection bias

### Steps in Conducting an RCT
1. Identify research question and hypothesis
2. Determine sample size and selection criteria
3. Randomly assign participants to groups
4. Implement intervention
5. Collect and analyze data
6. Draw conclusions and report findings

### Advantages of RCTs in Development Economics
- Ability to establish causal relationships
- Rigorous evaluation of program effectiveness
- Evidence-based policy making
- Potential for cost-effective interventions

### Challenges and Limitations
- Ethical considerations in withholding treatment
- External validity and generalizability of results
- Cost and time constraints
- Potential for spillover effects

## Application of RCTs in Timor-Leste

### Context of Timor-Leste
- Young nation with a history of conflict and colonization
- Significant development challenges: poverty, low education levels, health issues
- Limited research infrastructure and data availability

### Potential Areas for RCTs in Timor-Leste
- Education: testing effectiveness of different teaching methods or school management practices
- Health: evaluating interventions to improve maternal and child health outcomes
- Agriculture: assessing the impact of new farming techniques or crop varieties
- Microfinance: examining the effects of different loan products or financial literacy programs

### Considerations for Implementing RCTs in Timor-Leste
- Need for cultural sensitivity and community engagement
- Importance of capacity building for local researchers
- Challenges of working in remote and rural areas
- Potential for partnerships with international research institutions

# Discussion Questions

1. How has the field of development economics evolved over the past few decades, and what factors have driven this evolution?

2. What are the key advantages and limitations of using Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) in development economics research?

3. How might the unique context of Timor-Leste present both opportunities and challenges for implementing RCTs?

4. In what ways can the experimental approach in development economics complement or conflict with traditional economic theories and policies?

5. Discuss the ethical considerations involved in conducting RCTs in developing countries like Timor-Leste. How can researchers address these concerns?

6. How might the results of RCTs conducted in other developing countries be applicable or not applicable to Timor-Leste's context?

7. What role should local communities and government play in the design and implementation of RCTs in Timor-Leste?

8. How can researchers balance the need for scientific rigor with the practical realities of conducting studies in resource-constrained environments?

9. Discuss potential areas where RCTs could be particularly beneficial in addressing Timor-Leste's development challenges.

10. How might the use of RCTs in development economics influence policy-making in Timor-Leste and other developing countries?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflection on Timor-Leste's Development Challenges

1. Based on the class discussion and provided economic data, identify three key development challenges facing Timor-Leste.

2. For each challenge, write a brief paragraph (100-150 words) explaining:
   - The nature of the challenge
   - Its potential causes
   - Its impact on the country's overall development

3. Choose one of these challenges and propose a potential intervention that could be tested using an RCT. In your proposal (200-250 words), include:
   - A clear description of the intervention
   - The hypothesis you would test
   - A brief outline of how you would design the RCT
   - Potential challenges in implementing the RCT in Timor-Leste

4. Conclude with a reflection (100-150 words) on how the experimental approach in development economics could contribute to addressing Timor-Leste's unique development challenges.

Total word count: 700-900 words

# Assignment Details

## Case Study Analysis: RCT in a Developing Country

1. Read the provided case study of a successful RCT conducted in a developing country context.

2. In pairs, answer the following questions about the case study:
   a. What was the main research question or hypothesis of the study?
   b. Describe the intervention being tested and the control condition.
   c. What was the sample size and how were participants selected?
   d. What were the key findings of the study?
   e. How did the researchers address potential ethical concerns?
   f. What were the main limitations of the study?

3. Discuss how the findings from this study might be relevant to Timor-Leste's context. Consider:
   - Similarities and differences in the development challenges
   - Cultural or social factors that might affect the intervention's effectiveness in Timor-Leste
   - Practical considerations for implementing a similar study in Timor-Leste

4. Prepare a brief presentation (5-7 minutes) summarizing your analysis and conclusions to share with the class.

## Recommended Reading

Excerpt from "Poor Economics" by Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo (2011), Chapter 1:

"Why do the poor need to borrow so often, and why do they end up paying such high interest rates? Why do they miss out on free life-saving immunizations, but pay for unnecessary drugs? Why do they start many businesses but do not grow any of them? Why do they send their children to school, but not make sure that they learn? Why don't they want health insurance? Why is it so hard for them to save a little more? Why do they need to make their lives more difficult by having so many children? Why do they accept so much risk in their everyday lives? Why don't they demand better services from their politicians?

All these behaviors might seem irrational, short-sighted, or just plain stupid. In fact, the poor are no less rational than anyone elseâ€”quite the contrary. Precisely because they have so little, we often find them putting much careful thought into their choices: They have to be sophisticated economists just to survive. Yet our lives and theirs are so different in many ways that it is often hard for us to understand the logic of their choices."

This excerpt introduces some of the key questions and paradoxes that the experimental approach in development economics seeks to address, highlighting the importance of understanding the decision-making processes of those living in poverty.
