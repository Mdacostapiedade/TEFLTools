Here are the support materials for the lesson plan on Introduction to Experimental Approach in Development Economics:

# 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT): A type of scientific experiment that randomly assigns participants to different groups to test a specific intervention
- Development economics: A branch of economics that focuses on improving fiscal, economic, and social conditions in developing countries
- Poverty alleviation: Efforts to improve the quality of life for those living in poverty
- Experimental approach: A research method that uses controlled testing to understand causality
- Control group: In an experiment, the group that does not receive the intervention being tested
- Treatment group: In an experiment, the group that receives the intervention being tested
- Timor-Leste: A Southeast Asian country that gained independence in 2002, facing various development challenges
- Intervention: A program or policy implemented to address a specific issue or challenge
- Causality: The relationship between cause and effect
- Baseline data: Initial information collected before an intervention is implemented

# 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may have limited knowledge of Timor-Leste
   - Solution: Provide a brief overview of Timor-Leste's history and current situation at the beginning of the lesson. Use visual aids like maps and infographics to help students contextualize the information.

2. Challenge: Difficulty understanding the concept of RCTs
   - Solution: Use simple, relatable examples to explain RCTs. Consider using a classroom demonstration or role-play to illustrate the concept of random assignment and comparison between control and treatment groups.

3. Challenge: Connecting abstract economic concepts to real-world situations
   - Solution: Use case studies and real-life examples from Timor-Leste or similar contexts. Encourage students to relate the concepts to their own experiences or observations.

4. Challenge: Engaging students with diverse backgrounds and interests
   - Solution: Incorporate a variety of activities, including group discussions, individual reflections, and hands-on exercises. Use multimedia resources to cater to different learning styles.

5. Challenge: Time management, especially for the case study analysis
   - Solution: Provide clear time limits for each activity and use a timer. Consider assigning part of the case study reading as homework to allow more time for in-class discussion and analysis.
