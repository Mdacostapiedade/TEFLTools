- Explain the relationship between health and economic development
- Analyze experimental evidence on health interventions in developing countries
- Identify key health challenges in Timor-Leste
- Evaluate current health policies in Timor-Leste
- Design a community health program proposal for a specific Timorese district

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display a world map showing life expectancy by country
- Ask students to identify Timor-Leste and compare its life expectancy to neighboring countries and developed nations
- Facilitate a brief discussion on potential reasons for these differences

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Randomized controlled trial (RCT)

- Preventive care
- Health infrastructure
- Communicable and non-communicable diseases

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of the relationship between health and economic development
- Presentation on key findings from health intervention experiments in developing countries, focusing on:

- Have groups present their findings to the class, discussing potential interventions based on the experimental evidence presented earlier

## 7. Production Task (40 minutes)

- Students work in pairs to develop a proposal for a community health program in a specific Timorese district
- The proposal should include:
  * Identification of the target health issue
  * Proposed intervention based on experimental evidence
  * Implementation plan
  * Method for measuring impact
- Pairs present their proposals to the class for feedback

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Facilitate a brief discussion on the challenges of implementing health interventions in Timor-Leste
- Address any remaining questions from students

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Read the provided health intervention study conducted in Timor-Leste
- Write a 2-page critical analysis of the study, addressing:
  * The methodology used
  * The main findings
  * Potential limitations of the study
  * Implications for health policy in Timor-Leste
