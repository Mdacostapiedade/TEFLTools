## Relationship Between Health and Economic Development

- Health as a form of human capital
  - Healthier individuals are more productive
  - Better health leads to increased labor force participation
  - Improved health outcomes can lead to higher educational attainment

- Health and poverty cycle
  - Poor health can lead to reduced income and increased poverty
  - Poverty can lead to poor health due to lack of access to healthcare and nutrition

- Macroeconomic impacts
  - Healthier populations contribute to economic growth
  - Reduced healthcare costs can free up resources for other investments
  - Improved health can lead to demographic dividend

## Experimental Evidence on Health Interventions

### Deworming Programs

- Miguel and Kremer (2004) study in Kenya
  - Significant improvements in school attendance
  - Positive externalities on untreated children
  - Long-term impacts on income and standard of living

### Vaccination Campaigns

- Banerjee et al. (2010) study on incentives for immunization in India
  - Small incentives led to significant increases in immunization rates
  - Cost-effective intervention for improving child health

### Bed Net Distribution

- Cohen and Dupas (2010) study in Kenya
  - Free distribution led to higher usage rates than cost-sharing
  - Challenges traditional assumptions about pricing and usage

### Clean Water Interventions

- Kremer et al. (2011) study on spring protection in Kenya
  - Significant reduction in diarrheal diseases
  - Cost-effective intervention with high returns on investment

## Timor-Leste's Health Challenges

- Malnutrition
  - High rates of stunting and wasting in children under 5
  - Micronutrient deficiencies, particularly iron and vitamin A

- Maternal and child health
  - High maternal mortality ratio
  - Neonatal and under-5 mortality rates above regional averages

- Infectious diseases
  - Malaria, tuberculosis, and dengue fever prevalent
  - Emerging concerns about HIV/AIDS

- Limited healthcare infrastructure
  - Shortage of healthcare facilities, especially in rural areas
  - Lack of trained healthcare professionals
  - Limited access to essential medicines

## Current Health Policies in Timor-Leste

- National Health Sector Strategic Plan 2011-2030
  - Focus on primary healthcare and community-based interventions
  - Emphasis on maternal and child health

- Integrated Community Health Services (SISCa) program
  - Monthly health outreach activities in communities
  - Provides basic health services and health education

- National Nutrition Strategy 2014-2019
  - Aims to reduce malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies
  - Multi-sectoral approach involving health, agriculture, and education

- Malaria Control Program
  - Distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets
  - Indoor residual spraying in high-risk areas

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the relationship between health and economic development manifest in Timor-Leste's context?

2. What are the potential challenges in implementing large-scale health interventions in Timor-Leste, given its geographical and cultural diversity?

3. How might the experimental evidence from other developing countries be applicable or not applicable to Timor-Leste's health challenges?

4. What role should international aid organizations play in supporting Timor-Leste's health sector, and how can their efforts be best coordinated with local initiatives?

5. How can behavioral economics insights be applied to improve the effectiveness of health interventions in Timor-Leste?

6. What are the ethical considerations in conducting randomized controlled trials for health interventions in a resource-poor setting like Timor-Leste?

7. How can Timor-Leste's traditional healing practices be integrated with modern healthcare interventions?

8. What strategies could be employed to address the shortage of healthcare professionals in Timor-Leste?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Community Health Program Proposal

1. Choose a specific district in Timor-Leste for your health program proposal.

2. Research the district's demographic information, health statistics, and existing healthcare infrastructure.

3. Identify a pressing health issue in the chosen district based on your research.

4. Design a community health program that addresses the identified issue. Your proposal should include:
   - A clear statement of the health problem and its impact on the community
   - The proposed intervention, based on experimental evidence from similar contexts
   - An implementation plan, including timeline, resources needed, and potential partners
   - A method for measuring the impact of the intervention
   - Consideration of potential challenges and how they will be addressed

5. Your proposal should be 3-4 pages long, double-spaced, and include references to relevant studies and data sources.

6. Be prepared to present your proposal to the class and receive feedback from your peers and instructor.
