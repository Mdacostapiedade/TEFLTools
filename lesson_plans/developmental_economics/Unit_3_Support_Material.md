## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Limited student knowledge of Timor-Leste:
   - Provide a brief overview of Timor-Leste's history and current situation at the beginning of the lesson
   - Encourage students to research Timor-Leste before class

2. Difficulty understanding RCTs and experimental evidence:
   - Use simple, relatable examples to explain RCTs
   - Provide a step-by-step breakdown of how RCTs are conducted in health interventions

3. Challenges in analyzing health statistics:
   - Review basic statistical concepts before the lesson
   - Provide guided practice in interpreting health data

4. Cultural sensitivity when discussing health issues:
   - Emphasize the importance of cultural context in health interventions
   - Encourage students to consider local beliefs and practices when designing interventions

5. Maintaining engagement during the presentation:
   - Use interactive elements, such as quick polls or short discussions
   - Incorporate real-life stories or case studies to illustrate key points

6. Time management for group activities:
   - Clearly communicate time limits for each activity
   - Assign roles within groups to ensure efficient work

7. Difficulty in designing realistic health interventions:
   - Provide examples of successful interventions in similar contexts
   - Encourage students to focus on small-scale, achievable proposals
