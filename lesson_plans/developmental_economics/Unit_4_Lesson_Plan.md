# Lesson Plan: Behavioral Economics and Poverty Reduction in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts on key behavioral economics concepts
- Role-play scenario cards
- "Poor Economics" by Banerjee and Duflo (relevant chapters)
- Internet access for research

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define key concepts in behavioral economics relevant to development
- Identify cultural and social factors influencing decision-making in Timor-Leste
- Design a "nudge" intervention to promote savings among Timorese farmers
- Demonstrate how behavioral biases affect economic decisions through role-play

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick poll: Ask students to raise hands if they've ever made an impulsive purchase they later regretted

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Behavioral economics
- Present bias
- Loss aversion
- Mental accounting
- Nudge theory
- Choice architecture

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of behavioral economics and its relevance to development
- Key findings from behavioral economics research in developing countries
- Cultural and social factors specific to Timor-Leste that influence economic decision-making
- Examples of successful behavioral interventions in similar contexts

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Small group discussions: Identify potential behavioral barriers to saving money in Timor-Leste
- Pair work: Analyze a case study of a failed development project and suggest how behavioral insights could have improved its effectiveness

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

- Design a "nudge" intervention:
  * Divide class into groups of 3-4
  * Each group designs a behavioral intervention to promote savings among Timorese farmers
  * Groups present their ideas to the class for feedback

- Role-play exercise:
  * Assign roles (e.g., farmer, local official, NGO worker)
  * Act out scenarios demonstrating how behavioral biases affect economic decisions in Timor-Leste

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion: Key takeaways from the lesson
- Quick quiz: Students write down three ways behavioral economics can inform poverty reduction strategies

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Read the assigned chapter from "Poor Economics" on savings behavior
- Write a 500-word reflection on how behavioral insights could be applied to a specific development challenge in Timor-Leste
