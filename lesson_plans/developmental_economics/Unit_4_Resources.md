## Key Concepts in Behavioral Economics Relevant to Development

### 1. Present Bias

- Definition: The tendency to give stronger weight to payoffs that are closer to the present when considering trade-offs between two future moments.
- Relevance to development: Can lead to under-saving, under-investment in education and health, and difficulty in long-term planning.
- Example in Timor-Leste: Farmers may prioritize immediate consumption over investing in improved farming techniques or equipment.

### 2. Loss Aversion

- Definition: People's tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains.
- Relevance to development: Can lead to risk aversion and reluctance to adopt new technologies or practices.
- Example in Timor-Leste: Farmers may be hesitant to switch to new crop varieties, even if they offer potential benefits, due to fear of losing their current yield.

### 3. Mental Accounting

- Definition: The set of cognitive operations used by individuals to organize, evaluate, and keep track of financial activities.
- Relevance to development: Can influence how people allocate resources and make financial decisions.
- Example in Timor-Leste: Households may treat different sources of income (e.g., regular wages vs. remittances) differently, affecting spending and saving patterns.

### 4. Social Norms and Peer Effects

- Definition: The influence of social expectations and the behavior of others on individual decision-making.
- Relevance to development: Can impact adoption of new practices, health behaviors, and educational choices.
- Example in Timor-Leste: Decisions about family size or children's education may be strongly influenced by community norms.

### 5. Choice Overload

- Definition: The cognitive process in which people have a difficult time making a decision when faced with many options.
- Relevance to development: Can affect program uptake and effectiveness of interventions.
- Example in Timor-Leste: Offering too many microfinance products might lead to lower adoption rates.

## Cultural and Social Factors Influencing Decision-Making in Timor-Leste

### 1. Traditional Belief Systems

- Animist beliefs still prevalent in many areas
- Influence on agricultural practices, health-seeking behaviors, and resource management

### 2. Communal Land Ownership

- Traditional "rai nain" system of land tenure
- Impact on agricultural investment and productivity

### 3. Extended Family Networks

- Strong familial ties and obligations
- Influence on resource allocation and financial decision-making

### 4. Gender Roles and Norms

- Patriarchal society with distinct gender expectations
- Impact on women's economic participation and household decision-making

### 5. Linguistic Diversity

- Multiple local languages alongside official languages (Tetum and Portuguese)
- Challenges in information dissemination and program implementation

### 6. Post-Conflict Context

- Legacy of Indonesian occupation and internal conflicts
- Impact on trust in institutions and long-term planning

# Discussion Questions

1. How might present bias affect a Timorese farmer's decision to invest in education for their children? What interventions could help mitigate this bias?

2. In what ways could loss aversion impact the adoption of new agricultural technologies in Timor-Leste? How could development programs address this challenge?

3. How might mental accounting influence how remittances are spent in Timorese households? What are the potential positive and negative consequences of this?

4. Discuss how social norms in Timor-Leste might affect women's participation in microfinance programs. How could these programs be designed to address cultural barriers?

5. How might choice overload affect the effectiveness of health interventions in Timor-Leste? Provide an example and suggest ways to simplify decision-making for beneficiaries.

6. In what ways might traditional belief systems in Timor-Leste conflict with evidence-based development interventions? How can programs navigate these cultural sensitivities?

7. How could the communal land ownership system in Timor-Leste impact the effectiveness of agricultural development programs? What approaches might help address these challenges?

8. Discuss the potential pros and cons of leveraging extended family networks in poverty alleviation programs in Timor-Leste.

9. How might linguistic diversity in Timor-Leste affect the implementation of behavioral interventions? What strategies could be employed to ensure effective communication across language barriers?

10. In what ways might Timor-Leste's post-conflict context influence people's economic decision-making? How can development programs build trust and promote long-term thinking?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Behavioral Intervention Design

1. Choose one of the following development challenges in Timor-Leste:
   a) Low savings rates among rural households
   b) Underutilization of preventive health services
   c) Low adoption of improved agricultural techniques

2. Design a behavioral intervention to address your chosen challenge. Your intervention should:
   - Clearly identify the specific behavioral bias or cultural factor you are targeting
   - Describe the "nudge" or change in choice architecture you are proposing
   - Explain how your intervention takes into account the local context of Timor-Leste

3. Write a 750-1000 word proposal that includes:
   - Introduction: Brief overview of the challenge and your proposed intervention
   - Background: Relevant behavioral economics concepts and cultural factors
   - Intervention Design: Detailed description of your proposed intervention
   - Implementation: How the intervention would be rolled out, including any potential partnerships
   - Evaluation: How you would measure the effectiveness of your intervention
   - Potential Challenges: Discuss any ethical considerations or potential unintended consequences

4. Include at least three references to academic sources or case studies to support your proposal.

## Behavioral Economics Case Study Analysis

1. Read the following case study: "Commitment Savings Products in the Philippines" by Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin (2006).

2. Write a 1500-word analysis that addresses the following points:
   a) Summarize the key findings of the study and the behavioral economics concepts it explores.

## Example Behavioral Intervention

### Promoting Savings Through Mobile Money in Timor-Leste

Objective: Increase savings rates among rural Timorese households by leveraging mobile technology and addressing present bias.

Intervention Design:
1. Partner with local mobile network operators to develop a user-friendly mobile savings app
2. Implement an opt-out automatic savings feature that transfers a small percentage of incoming payments to a savings account
3. Provide personalized SMS reminders with savings goals and progress updates
4. Offer small, immediate rewards (e.g., mobile data bonuses) for reaching savings milestones

Cultural Considerations:
- Use local languages (Tetum and others) in the app and SMS messages
- Incorporate traditional symbols and imagery in the app design
- Engage with community leaders to promote the program and address trust issues

Evaluation:
- Randomized controlled trial comparing villages with and without the intervention
- Track savings rates, account balances, and frequency of withdrawals
- Conduct qualitative interviews to assess changes in attitudes towards saving

This example demonstrates how behavioral insights (present bias, mental accounting) can be combined with technology and cultural sensitivity to address a specific development challenge in Timor-Leste.
