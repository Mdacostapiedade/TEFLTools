Here's the support material for the lesson on Behavioral Economics and Poverty Reduction in Timor-Leste, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Behavioral Economics Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Behavioral economics**: The study of psychological, social, and emotional factors on economic decision-making
- **Present bias**: The tendency to give more weight to payoffs that are closer to the present time
- **Loss aversion**: People's tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains
- **Mental accounting**: The set of cognitive operations used by individuals to organize, evaluate, and keep track of financial activities
- **Nudge theory**: A concept that proposes positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions to influence behavior and decision-making
- **Choice architecture**: The practice of influencing choice by organizing the context in which people make decisions
- **Heuristics**: Mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that people use to make decisions quickly
- **Framing effect**: How the presentation of information influences decision-making
- **Social proof**: The psychological phenomenon where people copy the actions of others in an attempt to reflect correct behavior

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Behavioral Economics Concept Map**:
   A diagram showing the interconnections between key behavioral economics concepts, with "Behavioral Economics" at the center and branches connecting to "Present Bias," "Loss Aversion," "Mental Accounting," "Nudge Theory," and "Choice Architecture." Each branch should have brief explanations and examples relevant to Timor-Leste.

2. **Decision-Making Process Flowchart**:
   A flowchart illustrating how behavioral biases can influence decision-making in Timor-Leste. Include steps like "Perceive Problem," "Consider Options," "Evaluate Consequences," and "Make Decision," with arrows showing how biases like present bias and loss aversion can affect each stage.

3. **Nudge Intervention Examples**:
   A visual representation of different nudge interventions, such as:
   - Default savings options for farmers
   - Social proof messages for adopting new agricultural techniques
   - Framing health messages to emphasize gains rather than losses

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Behavioral Biases in Timor-Leste Worksheet**:
   - List of common scenarios in Timor-Leste (e.g., deciding to save money, choosing crops to plant)
   - Students identify potential behavioral biases at play in each scenario
   - Space for students to suggest interventions to address these biases

2. **Nudge Design Challenge**:
   - Problem statement: Low savings rates among Timorese farmers
   - Guided questions to help students design a nudge intervention:
     * What is the target behavior?
     * What are the current barriers to this behavior?
     * How can you make the desired behavior easier?
     * How can you make the desired behavior more attractive?
   - Space for students to sketch their nudge intervention design

3. **Case Study Analysis**:
   - Brief description of a failed development project in Timor-Leste
   - Questions prompting students to identify behavioral factors that may have contributed to the failure
   - Space for students to redesign the project using behavioral insights

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to understand how behavioral economics applies to Timor-Leste's context.
   **Solution**: Provide plenty of local examples and encourage students to share their own experiences. Use role-play exercises to make concepts more tangible.

2. **Challenge**: Some students might be skeptical about the effectiveness of "nudges" in addressing deep-rooted poverty issues.
   **Solution**: Acknowledge the limitations of behavioral interventions and emphasize that they are part of a broader strategy. Discuss examples where small changes led to significant impacts.

3. **Challenge**: Students may find it difficult to design effective nudge interventions.
   **Solution**: Provide a structured framework for nudge design and work through an example as a class before the group activity. Encourage creativity and remind students that there are no perfect solutions.

4. **Challenge**: Cultural sensitivity when discussing decision-making patterns in Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Emphasize that behavioral biases are universal human traits, not specific to any culture. Encourage students to reflect on their own decision-making processes.

5. **Challenge**: Keeping students engaged during the theoretical parts of the lesson.
   **Solution**: Use interactive methods like think-pair-share, quick polls, and real-world examples to break up the lecture portions. Incorporate multimedia elements like short videos or infographics.
