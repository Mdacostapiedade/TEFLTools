3. Gender-Sensitive Cash Transfer Programs
   - Study: Baird et al. (2011) in Malawi
   - Findings: Cash transfers to girls improve education outcomes and reduce early marriage
   - Relevance to Timor-Leste's development goals

### Challenges in Implementing Gender-Focused Interventions
- Cultural barriers and traditional norms
- Limited resources and competing priorities
- Measurement and long-term impact assessment

## Timor-Leste's Political Structure and Gender Dynamics

### Political Structure
- Brief history of Timor-Leste's independence and democratic transition
- Current government structure: semi-presidential system
- Electoral system and political parties

### Gender Dynamics in Politics
- Current representation of women in parliament and local government
- Legal framework for gender equality (e.g., Constitution, electoral laws)
- Cultural and social factors influencing women's political participation

### Key Challenges

2. Prevalence of gender-based violence
3. Traditional gender roles and expectations
4. Lack of women in leadership positions within political parties

### Ongoing Initiatives

# Discussion Questions

1. How do the findings from experimental studies on gender and politics in other developing countries apply to Timor-Leste's context? What adaptations might be necessary?

2. What are the main barriers to women's political participation in Timor-Leste, and how do they differ from those in other Southeast Asian countries?

3. How effective have gender quotas been in increasing women's substantive representation in other countries? Would a similar approach work in Timor-Leste?

4. What role can international organizations and NGOs play in promoting gender equality in Timor-Leste's political sphere without undermining local ownership and cultural sensitivity?

5. How might increasing women's political participation affect other development outcomes in Timor-Leste, such as education, health, and economic growth?

6. What strategies could be employed to engage men as allies in promoting women's political participation in Timor-Leste?

7. How can Timor-Leste's government balance the need for gender equality with respect for traditional cultural practices and norms?

8. What lessons can Timor-Leste learn from other post-conflict societies in terms of integrating women into political processes and decision-making?

# Assignment Details

## Mock Village Council Meeting

### Objective
To simulate a village council meeting addressing a gender-related issue in Timor-Leste, allowing students to apply their knowledge of gender dynamics and political processes.

### Instructions
1. Divide the class into groups representing different stakeholders:
   - Village chief and elders
   - Women's rights activists
   - Local government representatives
   - Traditional community leaders
   - Youth representatives
   - NGO workers

2. Assign a gender-related issue for discussion, such as:
   - Increasing girls' school attendance
   - Addressing domestic violence in the community
   - Promoting women's participation in local decision-making
   - Improving maternal health services

3. Each group should:
   - Research their stakeholder's typical perspective on the issue
   - Prepare a 3-5 minute presentation outlining their position and proposed solutions
   - Develop arguments to support their position during the debate

4. Conduct the mock council meeting:
   - Instructor acts as moderator
   - Each group presents their position (3-5 minutes each)
   - Open floor for debate and questions (20-30 minutes)
   - Work towards a consensus or vote on proposed solutions

5. After the mock meeting, conduct a debriefing session:
   - Discuss the dynamics observed during the meeting
   - Analyze how gender played a role in the discussion and decision-making process
   - Reflect on how the simulation compares to real village council meetings in Timor-Leste

6. Students should submit a one-page reflection on their experience and insights gained from the mock council meeting.

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Women's Participation in Suco Councils in Timor-Leste

In 2009, Timor-Leste introduced a quota system for women's representation in Suco (village) councils. This case study examines the implementation and impact of this policy.

### Background
- Suco councils are the lowest level of government in Timor-Leste
- Prior to 2009, women's representation in these councils was minimal

### Policy Implementation
- Law mandates at least two women and two youth representatives in each Suco council
- Quotas apply to both elected positions and appointed hamlet (aldeia) representatives

### Outcomes
- Increased women's representation in Suco councils from less than 3% to over 30%
- Challenges in implementation, including resistance from traditional leaders
- Mixed results in terms of women's substantive participation and influence

### Lessons Learned
- Importance of capacity building and support for women representatives
- Need for broader societal change to support women's leadership
- Potential for quotas to serve as a first step towards greater gender equality in politics
