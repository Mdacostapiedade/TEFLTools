# Lesson Plan: Designing and Implementing RCTs in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts on RCT design steps
- Case studies of RCTs conducted in Southeast Asia
- Flip charts and markers for group work
- "Running Randomized Evaluations: A Practical Guide" by Rachel Glennerster and Kudzai Takavarasha

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the key steps in designing and implementing an RCT
- Identify ethical considerations specific to conducting research in Timor-Leste
- Design a basic RCT proposal addressing a development challenge in Timor-Leste
- Critically evaluate RCT designs for feasibility and ethical considerations

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Students reflect on a development challenge they've observed in Timor-Leste and brainstorm how they might study its potential solutions.
- Class discussion on the challenges of measuring impact in development projects.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
- Treatment and control groups
- Baseline and endline surveys
- Power calculations
- Attrition
- Spillover effects

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

1. Overview of RCT design steps:
   - Identifying research questions
   - Determining sample size and power
   - Randomization strategies
   - Data collection methods
   - Analysis and interpretation

2. Ethical considerations in RCTs:
   - Informed consent
   - Potential risks and benefits to participants
   - Equity in resource allocation
   - Cultural sensitivity

3. Challenges specific to Timor-Leste:
   - Language barriers
   - Infrastructure limitations
   - Political sensitivities
   - Community engagement strategies

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Small group exercise: Analyze a case study of an RCT conducted in Southeast Asia, identifying key design elements and potential ethical issues.

2. Class discussion: Share findings from the case study analysis, comparing and contrasting with the Timor-Leste context.

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

1. Group project: In teams of 3-4, students design a basic RCT proposal addressing a specific development challenge in Timor-Leste. The proposal should include:
   - Research question
   - Intervention description
   - Randomization strategy
   - Data collection plan
   - Potential ethical considerations

2. Gallery walk: Groups post their proposals and circulate to review and provide feedback on other teams' designs.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key steps in RCT design and implementation
- Address common challenges and misconceptions identified during the production task
- Highlight the importance of ethical considerations and community engagement in Timor-Leste

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Read Chapter 4 "Randomization" from "Running Randomized Evaluations: A Practical Guide"

2. Individually refine the group RCT proposal based on feedback received, addressing any ethical concerns or implementation challenges specific to Timor-Leste.

3. Prepare a 5-minute presentation on the refined RCT proposal for the next class.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT): An experimental research design that randomly assigns participants to treatment and control groups to measure the impact of an intervention.

- Treatment group: The group of participants in an RCT who receive the intervention being studied.

- Control group: The group of participants in an RCT who do not receive the intervention, serving as a comparison for the treatment group.

- Baseline survey: Data collected from participants before the intervention begins.

- Endline survey: Data collected from participants after the intervention has been implemented.

- Power calculations: Statistical analyses used to determine the appropriate sample size for detecting the expected effect of an intervention.

- Attrition: The loss of participants from a study over time, which can affect the validity of results.

- Spillover effects: Unintended impacts of an intervention on individuals or groups not directly participating in the study.
