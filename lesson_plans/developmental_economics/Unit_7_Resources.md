# Lecture Notes

## Steps in Designing an RCT

1. Identify the research question
   - Ensure it's specific, measurable, and relevant to Timor-Leste's development challenges
   - Example: "Does providing micronutrient supplements to pregnant women in rural Timor-Leste improve birth outcomes?"

2. Determine sample size and power
   - Use power calculations to determine the number of participants needed
   - Consider Timor-Leste's population distribution and accessibility challenges

3. Randomization strategy
   - Individual randomization vs. cluster randomization
   - Stratification to ensure balance across important variables

4. Data collection methods
   - Surveys, interviews, administrative data, or direct observations
   - Consider language barriers and literacy levels in Timor-Leste

5. Implementation plan
   - Timeline, budget, and logistics
   - Partnerships with local organizations and government agencies

6. Analysis plan
   - Pre-specify primary and secondary outcomes
   - Plan for dealing with attrition and non-compliance

7. Ethical considerations
   - Obtain IRB approval and informed consent
   - Ensure equitable distribution of benefits

## Ethical Considerations and Community Engagement in Timor-Leste

1. Cultural sensitivity
   - Respect for local customs and traditions
   - Involvement of community leaders in research design

2. Language considerations
   - Use of local languages (Tetum, Portuguese, and indigenous languages)
   - Trained translators for informed consent and data collection

3. Informed consent process
   - Clear explanation of study purpose, risks, and benefits
   - Consideration of collective decision-making in Timorese communities

4. Equitable distribution of resources
   - Plan for providing interventions to control group after study completion
   - Avoid exacerbating existing inequalities

5. Data privacy and protection
   - Secure storage of sensitive information
   - Respect for local privacy norms

6. Community engagement strategies
   - Regular community meetings and updates
   - Involvement of local researchers and enumerators

7. Addressing potential harms
   - Plan for addressing unexpected negative outcomes
   - Provision of support services if needed

8. Long-term sustainability
   - Capacity building for local institutions
   - Knowledge transfer to Timorese researchers and policymakers

# Discussion Questions

1. What are the unique challenges of conducting RCTs in Timor-Leste compared to other developing countries? How can researchers address these challenges?

2. How can researchers balance the need for scientific rigor with ethical considerations when designing RCTs in Timor-Leste?

3. What role should local communities play in the design and implementation of RCTs in Timor-Leste? How can researchers ensure meaningful community engagement?

4. How might the cultural and linguistic diversity of Timor-Leste impact the design and implementation of RCTs? What strategies can researchers use to address these factors?

5. What are the potential risks of conducting RCTs in a post-conflict society like Timor-Leste? How can these risks be mitigated?

6. How can researchers ensure that the results of RCTs conducted in Timor-Leste are translated into effective policy recommendations?

7. What are the ethical implications of using a control group in RCTs addressing critical development challenges in Timor-Leste? How can researchers justify this approach?

8. How might the presence of international researchers and organizations conducting RCTs impact local power dynamics in Timor-Leste? What steps can be taken to minimize negative effects?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## RCT Design Proposal

1. Choose a specific development challenge in Timor-Leste (e.g., malnutrition, school dropout rates, agricultural productivity).

2. Write a 2-3 page proposal for an RCT to address this challenge. Your proposal should include:

   a. Research question and hypothesis
   b. Brief background on the issue in Timor-Leste
   c. Proposed intervention
   d. Randomization strategy
   e. Sample size and power calculations
   f. Data collection methods
   g. Timeline for implementation
   h. Potential ethical considerations
   i. Community engagement plan

3. Ensure your proposal takes into account the unique context of Timor-Leste, including cultural, linguistic, and logistical factors.

4. Include a brief section on how you would address potential challenges specific to conducting research in Timor-Leste.

5. Conclude with a paragraph on how the results of your proposed RCT could inform policy decisions in Timor-Leste.

# Assignment Details

## Peer Review of RCT Designs

1. Exchange your RCT design proposal with a classmate.

2. Review your peer's proposal using the following criteria:
   - Clarity and specificity of research question
   - Appropriateness of intervention for Timor-Leste context
   - Feasibility of randomization strategy
   - Adequacy of sample size and power calculations
   - Appropriateness of data collection methods
   - Consideration of ethical issues
   - Quality of community engagement plan
   - Overall feasibility and potential impact

3. Provide written feedback (1-2 pages) addressing the above criteria. Include:
   - Strengths of the proposal
   - Areas for improvement
   - Suggestions for addressing challenges specific to Timor-Leste
   - Questions or concerns about ethical considerations
   - Ideas for enhancing community engagement

4. Be prepared to discuss your feedback in class and engage in a constructive dialogue about improving RCT designs for the Timor-Leste context.

## Case Study: Deworming in Kenya

Read the summary of the study "Worms: Identifying Impacts on Education and Health in the Presence of Treatment Externalities" by Edward Miguel and Michael Kremer (2004).

This seminal RCT in Kenya demonstrated the positive effects of school-based deworming on health and education outcomes. Consider how a similar study might be designed and implemented in Timor-Leste, taking into account the different context and challenges.

## Timor-Leste Development Statistics

Review the following key statistics about Timor-Leste to inform your RCT designs:

- Population: 1.3 million (2019)
- GDP per capita: $1,560 (2019)
- Human Development Index: 0.606 (2019, ranked 141 out of 189 countries)
- Literacy rate: 68.1% (2018)
- Life expectancy: 69.5 years (2018)
- Under-5 mortality rate: 41 per 1,000 live births (2019)
- Poverty rate: 41.8% (2014)

## Ethical Guidelines for Research in Developing Countries

Review the following resources on ethical considerations for research in developing countries:

1. Emanuel, E. J., Wendler, D., Killen, J., & Grady, C. (2004). What makes clinical research in developing countries ethical? The benchmarks of ethical research. The Journal of Infectious Diseases, 189(5), 930-937.

2. Nuffield Council on Bioethics. (2002). The ethics of research related to healthcare in developing countries.

Consider how these guidelines apply to the Timor-Leste context and incorporate relevant principles into your RCT designs.
