# Support Material for RCT Lesson Plan

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)**: An experimental research design that randomly assigns participants to treatment and control groups to measure the impact of an intervention.
- **Treatment group**: The group of participants in an RCT who receive the intervention being studied.
- **Control group**: The group of participants in an RCT who do not receive the intervention, serving as a comparison for the treatment group.
- **Baseline survey**: Data collected from participants before the intervention begins.
- **Endline survey**: Data collected from participants after the intervention has been implemented.
- **Power calculations**: Statistical analyses used to determine the appropriate sample size for detecting the expected effect of an intervention.
- **Attrition**: The loss of participants from a study over time, which can affect the validity of results.
- **Spillover effects**: Unintended impacts of an intervention on individuals or groups not directly participating in the study.
- **Informed consent**: The process of obtaining permission from research participants after fully informing them about the study's purpose, risks, and benefits.
- **Randomization**: The process of randomly assigning participants to treatment or control groups to ensure unbiased comparison.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barriers:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle with English-language resources.
   - Solution: Provide glossaries of key terms in Tetum or Portuguese, and encourage peer translation support.

2. Limited Local Examples:
   - Challenge: Few RCTs have been conducted in Timor-Leste.
   - Solution: Use examples from similar contexts in Southeast Asia, and encourage students to adapt these to Timor-Leste's specific circumstances.

3. Ethical Concerns:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle with ethical implications of RCTs in vulnerable communities.
   - Solution: Emphasize the importance of community engagement and participatory research methods. Discuss real-world examples of ethical challenges and how they were addressed.

4. Technical Complexity:
   - Challenge: Some students may find statistical concepts challenging.
   - Solution: Use visual aids and practical exercises to explain complex ideas. Provide additional resources for students who need extra support.

5. Contextual Understanding:
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of familiarity with Timor-Leste's development context.
   - Solution: Incorporate local guest speakers and field visits to development projects. Encourage students to share their own experiences and observations.

6. Group Work Dynamics:
   - Challenge: Uneven participation in group activities.
   - Solution: Assign specific roles within groups and rotate these roles for different activities. Use peer evaluation as part of the assessment process.

7. Applying Theory to Practice:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle to connect theoretical concepts to real-world applications.
   - Solution: Use case studies and simulation exercises. Encourage students to relate course content to their own observations and experiences in Timor-Leste.
