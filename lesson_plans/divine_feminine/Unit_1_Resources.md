2. Plateau phase
   - Intensification of excitement phase responses
3. Orgasm phase
   - Rhythmic contractions of pelvic muscles
   - Release of oxytocin and other neurochemicals
4. Resolution phase
   - Return to unaroused state
   - Refractory period in males

# Discussion Questions

1. How do biological factors interact with psychological and social factors in shaping human sexuality?
2. What are some examples of how culture influences views on sexuality in Timor-Leste? How might these differ from other cultures?
3. How does the concept of sexual dimorphism relate to gender roles in society? Are these roles primarily biological or cultural?
4. Discuss the potential evolutionary advantages and disadvantages of different mating strategies.
5. How might understanding the sexual response cycle impact sexual health education and practices?
6. In what ways do media representations of sexuality influence individual attitudes and behaviors?
7. How do religious beliefs in Timor-Leste shape sexual norms and practices?
8. Discuss the ethical implications of applying evolutionary theories to human sexual behavior.

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Writing on Personal Views and Cultural Influences

1. Take 5 minutes to quietly reflect on your personal experiences and cultural background.
2. Consider how these factors have shaped your views on sexuality.
3. Write a 1-2 page reflection addressing the following points:
   - Key experiences or messages from your upbringing that influenced your views on sexuality
   - Cultural norms or expectations regarding sexuality in your community
   - How your views may have changed or evolved over time
   - Areas where you feel your personal views align with or differ from your cultural background
   - Any questions or areas of uncertainty you have about sexuality
4. Remember, this is a personal reflection. Focus on honest self-examination rather than what you think others want to hear.
5. You will not be required to share this writing, but there will be an opportunity for voluntary sharing with the class.

# Assignment Details

## Homework: Evolutionary Perspective Response

1. Read Chapter 1 of "Sex at Dawn" by Ryan & Jethá (2010).
2. Write a 1-page response (approximately 250-300 words) addressing the following question:
   "How does the evolutionary perspective challenge or support your current understanding of human sexuality?"
3. In your response, consider:
   - Key points from the chapter that stood out to you
   - How the evolutionary perspective compares to other explanations of human sexuality you're familiar with
   - Any aspects of the evolutionary perspective that you find convincing or problematic
   - How this perspective might apply to or explain sexual attitudes and behaviors in Timor-Leste
4. Use specific examples from the text to support your points.
5. Conclude with any questions or areas you'd like to explore further.
6. Format: 12-point font, double-spaced, 1-inch margins.
