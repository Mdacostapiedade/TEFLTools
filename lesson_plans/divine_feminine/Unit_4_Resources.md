## Excerpt from Historical Document: Portuguese Colonial Marriage Law (1914)

"Article 3: Only marriages performed in accordance with Catholic rites or civil ceremonies as prescribed by Portuguese law shall be recognized as legal unions in the Province of Timor.

Article 7: The practice of polygamy is hereby prohibited and shall be punishable by a fine of not less than 100 patacas or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.

Article 12: In matters of inheritance and property rights within marriage, the Portuguese Civil Code shall take precedence over any local customs or traditions."

## Case Study: The Barlake Controversy

In 1930, Portuguese colonial administrators attempted to regulate the traditional Timorese practice of barlake (bride price exchange) in the district of Viqueque. This led to widespread protests and resistance from local communities who saw the practice as integral to their social and economic systems.

Key points:
- Colonial view: Barlake as "primitive" and oppressive to women
- Timorese perspective: Barlake as a symbol of respect and alliance between families
- Compromise reached: Limited regulation allowing barlake but capping the value of exchanges

Discuss the implications of this controversy for understanding the clash between colonial and indigenous values regarding marriage and sexuality.
