## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have strong personal or religious beliefs that conflict with concepts of feminist spirituality or goddess worship.
   - **Solution**: Emphasize that the goal is to understand diverse perspectives, not to change personal beliefs. Encourage respectful dialogue and create a safe space for all viewpoints.

2. **Challenge**: Some students may struggle to connect ancient or foreign concepts of the divine feminine to their own experiences.
   - **Solution**: Use local examples and encourage students to draw parallels with their own cultural background. Emphasize the universal aspects of feminine spirituality.

3. **Challenge**: Discussing sexuality and gender roles may be uncomfortable for some students in a conservative cultural context.
   - **Solution**: Establish clear ground rules for respectful discussion. Use academic language and focus on cultural and historical aspects rather than personal experiences.

4. **Challenge**: Students may have limited background knowledge about feminist movements or global spiritual practices.
   - **Solution**: Provide additional context and background information as needed. Consider assigning pre-reading materials to build foundational knowledge.

5. **Challenge**: Integrating traditional Timorese beliefs with modern feminist concepts may seem forced or artificial to some students.
   - **Solution**: Encourage critical thinking about the process of cultural evolution. Discuss examples of successful syncretism in other aspects of Timorese culture.
