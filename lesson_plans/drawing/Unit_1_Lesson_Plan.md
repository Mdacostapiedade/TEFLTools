Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 1: Foundations of Drawing, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Foundations of Drawing

## 1. Resources Needed
- Sketchbooks or locally available paper
- Pencils (various hardnesses if available)
- Erasers
- Charcoal (locally sourced if possible)
- Round fruits (coconuts, papayas, or similar)
- Small lamp or flashlight for demonstrating light and shadow

## 2. Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify and use basic drawing materials
- Understand and apply simple shading techniques
- Recognize and depict light and shadow on spherical objects

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Blind contour drawing: Students draw a simple object (e.g., their hand) without looking at the paper, focusing on observing the subject closely.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)
Introduce and explain:
- Shading
- Highlight
- Shadow
- Texture
- Contour

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)
- Introduce basic drawing materials (pencils, charcoal, erasers)
- Demonstrate how to hold and use each tool
- Explain the concept of shading and its importance in creating 3D effects
- Show examples of spheres with different shading techniques

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)
- Students experiment with different drawing materials
- Practice basic shading techniques (hatching, cross-hatching, blending)
- Draw simple geometric shapes (circles, squares) and add shading

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)
- Students draw a sphere using their preferred shading method
- Set up a still life with round fruits and a light source
- Students sketch the fruits, focusing on capturing light and shadow

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
- Gallery walk: Students display their drawings and observe each other's work
- Class discussion on challenges faced and techniques that worked well

## 9. Homework Assignment
- Sketch three round objects found at home or in nature, focusing on shading and light effects
- Experiment with different drawing materials if available

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Shading: The technique of adding depth and volume to a drawing by representing light and shadow
- Highlight: The brightest area on an object where light directly hits
- Shadow: The darkest area on an object where light is blocked
- Texture: The surface quality of an object that can be represented through drawing techniques
- Contour: The outline or edge of a shape or form in a drawing
