# Learning Unit 1: Foundations of Drawing - Resources

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Introduction to Drawing Materials

#### Pencils
- Different hardness grades (H, HB, B)
- How to hold and use for various effects
- Sharpening techniques

#### Charcoal
- Types: vine, compressed, pencil
- Advantages: rich blacks, easy blending
- Challenges: messy, requires fixative

#### Erasers
- Types: kneaded, gum, vinyl
- Uses beyond erasing: creating highlights, blending

### The Sphere and Shading Techniques

#### Basic Shading Methods
1. Hatching: parallel lines
2. Cross-hatching: overlapping lines at angles
3. Stippling: dots or small marks
4. Blending: smooth gradations

#### Applying Shading to a Sphere
- Identifying the light source
- Locating the highlight
- Creating the core shadow
- Depicting the cast shadow

### Observing Light and Shadow in Nature

- Natural vs. artificial light sources
- How light interacts with different surfaces
- Shadows: attached and cast
- Reflections and ambient light

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How does the choice of drawing material affect the final appearance of an artwork?
2. Why is understanding light and shadow crucial for creating realistic drawings?
3. How can observing everyday objects help improve your drawing skills?
4. What challenges did you face when trying to create a 3D effect on paper?
5. How might different cultures or environments influence the way artists perceive and depict light and shadow?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

### Reflective Journal Entry
Write a 1-2 page reflection on your experience with the shading exercises. Consider the following prompts:

- Which shading technique did you find most challenging? Why?
- Describe a moment when you noticed an interesting play of light and shadow in your surroundings.
- How has this week's lesson changed the way you look at objects around you?

## 4. Assignment Details

### Sphere and Fruit Study

#### Objective
Create a still life drawing featuring at least three spherical objects (e.g., fruits, balls) with varying textures.

#### Requirements
- Use at least two different drawing materials (e.g., pencil and charcoal)
- Demonstrate at least two shading techniques
- Show clear light source and shadows
- Include a brief written explanation of your process and choices

#### Evaluation Criteria
- Accuracy of spherical forms
- Effective use of shading techniques
- Convincing depiction of light and shadow
- Variety in textures
- Overall composition
