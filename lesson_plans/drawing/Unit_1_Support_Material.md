# Support Material: Foundations of Drawing

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Shading**: The technique of adding depth and volume to a drawing by representing light and shadow
- **Highlight**: The brightest area on an object where light directly hits
- **Shadow**: The darkest area on an object where light is blocked
- **Texture**: The surface quality of an object that can be represented through drawing techniques
- **Contour**: The outline or edge of a shape or form in a drawing
- **Hatching**: A shading technique using closely spaced parallel lines
- **Cross-hatching**: A shading technique using intersecting sets of parallel lines
- **Blending**: A shading technique that smooths transitions between light and dark areas

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. Basic Shading Techniques Diagram:
   - A series of squares showing:
     a) Hatching: parallel lines in one direction
     b) Cross-hatching: intersecting parallel lines
     c) Blending: smooth gradation from light to dark

2. Light and Shadow on a Sphere:
   - A circle with:
     a) Highlight: small white area at the top
     b) Mid-tones: gradually darkening area
     c) Core shadow: darkest area opposite the light source
     d) Cast shadow: dark area extending from the base of the sphere

3. Different Pencil Hardnesses:
   - A scale showing marks made by pencils from 6H (lightest) to 6B (darkest)

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. Shading Practice Sheet:
   - Six circles for students to practice different shading techniques
   - Instructions for each circle (e.g., "Use hatching to create a 3D effect")

2. Light and Shadow Observation:
   - Outline of a simple still life setup (e.g., a coconut and a papaya)
   - Space for students to sketch and label highlight, mid-tones, and shadow areas

3. Drawing Materials Exploration:
   - Boxes for students to test and compare marks made by different drawing tools
   - Space to write observations about each material

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Online tutorials:
   - "Basic Shading Techniques" by DrawingArtists.com
   - "Understanding Light and Shadow" by Proko.com

2. Books (if available):
   - "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" by Betty Edwards
   - "Keys to Drawing" by Bert Dodson

3. Local art references:
   - Examples of shading in traditional Timorese crafts (e.g., tais weaving patterns)
   - Photographs of local landscapes showing natural light and shadow

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Limited drawing materials:
   - Encourage creativity with locally available materials (e.g., charcoal from cooking fires)
   - Demonstrate techniques using simple pencils if specialized drawing pencils are unavailable

2. Students struggling with 3D concepts:
   - Use hands-on demonstrations with actual spherical objects and a light source
   - Encourage students to close one eye when observing to flatten the image

3. Difficulty in seeing gradual tonal changes:
   - Have students squint when looking at objects to simplify tonal areas
   - Use a viewfinder (a small cardboard frame) to isolate parts of the subject

4. Frustration with initial results:
   - Emphasize that drawing is a skill that improves with practice
   - Show examples of professional artists' early work to illustrate improvement over time

5. Varying skill levels in the class:
   - Provide additional challenges for advanced students (e.g., drawing more complex objects)
   - Pair students of different skill levels for peer learning opportunities

6. Cultural considerations:
   - Be aware of any local taboos or sensitivities regarding certain objects or imagery
   - Incorporate traditional Timorese art forms as examples when possible to increase relevance
