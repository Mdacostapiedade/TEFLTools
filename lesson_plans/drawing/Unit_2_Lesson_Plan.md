Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 2: Form and Perspective, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Form and Perspective

## 1. Resources Needed
- Sketchbooks or drawing paper
- Pencils (2B, 4B, 6B)
- Erasers
- Ruler
- Examples of local architecture (photos or drawings)
- Simple objects for demonstration (cube, cylinder)

## 2. Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Draw basic 3D shapes (cubes and cylinders) with proper shading
- Understand and apply one-point perspective in drawings
- Sketch simple architectural forms using 3D techniques

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Quick sketch challenge: Students draw a simple object (e.g., a box or can) from their desk in 2 minutes
- Share and discuss drawings, focusing on how students attempted to show depth

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)
Introduce and explain key terms:
- Perspective
- Vanishing point
- Horizon line
- Foreshortening
- Form
- Volume

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Demonstrate drawing a cube and cylinder in 3D
   - Emphasize proper shading techniques
   - Show how light affects form
2. Introduce one-point perspective
   - Explain concept of vanishing point and horizon line
   - Demonstrate drawing a simple street scene
3. Apply 3D techniques to local architecture
   - Show examples of traditional Timorese houses
   - Discuss how to break down complex forms into simple shapes

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)
1. Students practice drawing cubes and cylinders in their sketchbooks
2. In pairs, students create simple one-point perspective drawings of a room
3. Guided practice: Draw a basic traditional Timorese house using cubes and cylinders

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)
1. Students choose a local building or street scene to sketch
2. Apply 3D drawing techniques and one-point perspective to create a detailed drawing
3. Add shading and details to enhance the sense of form and depth

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Gallery walk: Students display their drawings and provide peer feedback
- Class discussion on challenges faced and techniques learned
- Quick review of key concepts (3D forms, perspective, architectural drawing)

## 9. Homework Assignment
- Sketch a street scene near your home using one-point perspective
- Practice drawing at least 5 cubes and 5 cylinders in various positions

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Perspective: The technique of representing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional surface
- Vanishing point: The point at which receding parallel lines appear to meet in the distance
- Horizon line: The line in a perspective drawing where the sky appears to meet the ground
- Foreshortening: The technique of depicting an object or view as shorter than it actually is to create an illusion of depth
- Form: The three-dimensional shape of an object
- Volume: The space occupied by a three-dimensional object
