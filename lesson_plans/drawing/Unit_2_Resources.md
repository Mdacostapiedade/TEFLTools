# Resources for Learning Unit 2: Form and Perspective

## 1. Lecture Notes

### A. Drawing Cubes and Cylinders in 3D

#### Basic Cube Construction
1. Start with a square for the front face
2. Draw diagonal lines from corners to find the center
3. From the center, draw lines for the sides and top
4. Connect the lines to complete the cube
5. Erase unnecessary lines

#### Shading the Cube
1. Identify the light source
2. Leave the face closest to the light source unshaded
3. Apply light shading to adjacent faces
4. Apply darker shading to faces furthest from the light

#### Basic Cylinder Construction
1. Draw an oval for the top
2. Draw two vertical lines down from the sides of the oval
3. Draw another oval at the bottom, slightly smaller than the top
4. Connect the ovals with curved lines

#### Shading the Cylinder
1. Identify the light source
2. Leave a strip unshaded where light hits directly
3. Gradually increase shading towards the edges
4. Add an elliptical shadow at the base

### B. Introduction to Perspective Drawing

#### One-Point Perspective Basics
1. Define the horizon line
2. Place a vanishing point on the horizon line
3. Draw vertical and horizontal lines for the front plane
4. Connect corners to the vanishing point for depth

#### Creating Depth in One-Point Perspective
1. Objects closer to the viewer are larger and lower on the page
2. Objects farther away are smaller and closer to the horizon line
3. All receding lines converge at the vanishing point

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Inconsistent vanishing point
2. Incorrect scale of objects
3. Forgetting to use vertical lines

### C. Applying 3D Techniques to Local Architecture

#### Analyzing Architectural Forms
1. Break down complex structures into basic shapes (cubes, cylinders, pyramids)
2. Identify main structural elements (walls, roof, supports)
3. Note unique features of Timorese architecture (elevated structures, thatched roofs)

#### Drawing Traditional Timorese Houses
1. Start with a basic cube for the main structure
2. Add cylindrical supports for elevated houses
3. Use triangular prisms for roof structures
4. Add details like stairs, windows, and decorative elements

#### Incorporating Perspective
1. Place the building in a one-point perspective setting
2. Use perspective techniques to show depth and dimension
3. Add surrounding elements (trees, paths) to enhance the scene

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How does understanding 3D forms improve our ability to draw from observation?
2. In what ways does perspective drawing change how we perceive our environment?
3. How do the basic shapes we've learned (cubes and cylinders) relate to traditional Timorese architecture?
4. What challenges did you face when applying one-point perspective to your drawings?
5. How does the use of shading enhance the sense of form in your drawings?
6. In what ways can perspective drawing be useful outside of art (e.g., in design or architecture)?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a short paragraph (5-7 sentences) describing a traditional Timorese house or building. Focus on its three-dimensional qualities, considering how you would break it down into basic shapes for drawing. Include details about its form, structure, and any unique architectural features.

## 4. Assignment Details

### Main Assignment: Street Scene in One-Point Perspective

1. Choose a street or outdoor scene in your community
2. Create a detailed sketch using one-point perspective
3. Include at least three buildings or structures
4. Add elements like people, vehicles, or trees to bring the scene to life
5. Apply shading techniques to enhance depth and form
6. Size: A4 paper or two full pages in your sketchbook
7. Medium: Pencil (use various hardnesses for shading)

### Practice Exercises

1. Draw 5 cubes and 5 cylinders in various positions and lighting conditions
2. Sketch a simple room interior using one-point perspective
3. Draw a traditional Timorese house using basic 3D shapes
