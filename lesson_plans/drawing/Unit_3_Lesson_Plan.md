Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 3: Natural Forms, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Natural Forms

## 1. Resources Needed
- Sketchbooks or drawing paper
- Pencils (various hardnesses)
- Erasers
- Charcoal (if available)
- Examples of local plants and flowers (real or photographs)
- Reference images of trees and foliage

## 2. Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify and sketch basic shapes in natural forms
- Apply 3D drawing techniques to depict plants and trees
- Create realistic textures for leaves and bark
- Compose a drawing of local flora

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Quick sketch challenge: Students draw as many different leaf shapes as they can in 5 minutes
- Share and discuss the variety of shapes observed

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (10 minutes)
Introduce and explain:
- Organic shapes
- Contour lines
- Negative space
- Texture techniques (stippling, cross-hatching, scumbling)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)
- Demonstrate how to break down complex plant forms into basic shapes
- Show techniques for creating depth and dimension in foliage
- Explain and demonstrate methods for drawing tree trunks and branches
- Discuss composition techniques for arranging plant elements in a drawing

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)
- Students practice drawing individual leaves using contour lines and shading
- Sketch the basic structure of a tree, focusing on trunk and main branches
- Experiment with texture techniques to create bark and leaf textures

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)
- Students choose a local tree (e.g., banana or coffee plant) to sketch in detail
- Apply learned techniques to create a realistic representation of the chosen tree
- Add surrounding foliage or background elements to complete the composition

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
- Gallery walk: Students display their drawings and provide peer feedback
- Instructor highlights successful techniques and areas for improvement
- Recap key points and address any questions

## 9. Homework Assignment
- Create a detailed drawing of a bouquet of tropical flowers
- Research and sketch three different types of local plants or trees

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Organic shapes: Irregular, curved forms found in nature
- Contour lines: Outlines that define the edges and surface of an object
- Negative space: The space around and between objects in a composition
- Stippling: Creating texture or shading using small dots
- Cross-hatching: Creating texture or shading using intersecting lines
- Scumbling: Creating texture by making small circular marks
