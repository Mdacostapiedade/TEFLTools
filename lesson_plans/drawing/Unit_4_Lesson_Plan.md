Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 4: Landscape Drawing, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Landscape Drawing

## 1. Resources Needed
- Sketchbooks or drawing paper
- Pencils (various hardnesses)
- Erasers
- Charcoal (if available)
- Reference images of local landscapes (mountains, coast, rice paddies)
- Whiteboard or large paper for demonstrations

## 2. Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Compose basic landscape drawings
- Apply atmospheric perspective to create depth in landscapes
- Identify key elements of landscape composition

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Quick sketch challenge: Students have 5 minutes to draw a simple landscape from memory
- Share and discuss: Students briefly show their sketches and explain their choices

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)
Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Landscape composition
- Foreground, middle ground, background
- Atmospheric perspective
- Horizon line
- Vanishing point

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
- Introduction to landscape composition:
  * Explain the rule of thirds and its application in landscapes
  * Demonstrate how to use foreground, middle ground, and background
- Atmospheric perspective:
  * Explain the concept and its effect on creating depth
  * Demonstrate techniques for creating atmospheric perspective (fading details, lightening values, reducing contrast)
- Showcase examples of local landscapes and discuss their composition

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)
- Composition exercise: Students create 3-4 thumbnail sketches of different landscape compositions using simple shapes
- Atmospheric perspective practice: Students draw a series of mountains or hills, applying atmospheric perspective techniques

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)
- Task 1: Students sketch a view of the mountains or coast, focusing on composition and atmospheric perspective
- Task 2: Students draw a rice paddy field, emphasizing depth and atmospheric effects

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Gallery walk: Students display their work and provide peer feedback
- Class discussion: Review key concepts learned and address any questions
- Reflection: Students share one thing they learned and one area they want to improve

## 9. Homework Assignment
- Create a landscape drawing of a favorite local scene, applying the techniques learned in class
- Research and find examples of landscape art from Timorese artists or other Southeast Asian cultures

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Landscape composition: The arrangement of elements in a landscape drawing or painting
- Foreground: The part of the landscape closest to the viewer
- Middle ground: The area between the foreground and background in a landscape
- Background: The part of the landscape farthest from the viewer
- Atmospheric perspective: A technique used to create the illusion of depth by reducing contrast, detail, and color intensity for distant objects
- Horizon line: The line where the sky appears to meet the earth
- Vanishing point: The point at which parallel lines appear to converge in the distance
