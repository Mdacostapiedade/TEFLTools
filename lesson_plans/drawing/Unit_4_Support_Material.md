# Support Material for Landscape Drawing Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Landscape composition**: The arrangement of elements in a landscape drawing or painting
- **Foreground**: The part of the landscape closest to the viewer
- **Middle ground**: The area between the foreground and background in a landscape
- **Background**: The part of the landscape farthest from the viewer
- **Atmospheric perspective**: A technique used to create the illusion of depth by reducing contrast, detail, and color intensity for distant objects
- **Horizon line**: The line where the sky appears to meet the earth
- **Vanishing point**: The point at which parallel lines appear to converge in the distance
- **Rule of thirds**: A composition guideline that divides an image into a 3x3 grid, suggesting that important elements should be placed along these lines or at their intersections
- **Depth**: The illusion of distance or three-dimensionality in a two-dimensional artwork

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. Rule of Thirds Diagram:
   - A rectangular image divided into a 3x3 grid with two horizontal and two vertical lines
   - Key elements of a landscape (e.g., mountains, trees) placed at the intersections of these lines

2. Atmospheric Perspective Illustration:
   - A series of mountains or hills receding into the distance
   - Each successive range is lighter in value, has less detail, and lower contrast

3. Landscape Composition Elements:
   - A simple landscape sketch labeled with "Foreground," "Middle ground," and "Background"
   - Examples of elements in each area (e.g., rocks in foreground, trees in middle ground, mountains in background)

4. Vanishing Point and Horizon Line:
   - A landscape sketch with a clear horizon line
   - Parallel lines (e.g., road, fences) converging at a vanishing point on the horizon

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. Composition Practice Sheet:
   - Six empty rectangles for students to create thumbnail sketches
   - Instructions to experiment with different landscape compositions using simple shapes
   - Reminders about the rule of thirds and foreground/middle ground/background elements

2. Atmospheric Perspective Exercise:
   - A template with a series of overlapping mountain outlines
   - Instructions for students to shade each range, progressively lightening the value and reducing detail for distant mountains

3. Local Landscape Reference Guide:
   - A collection of simple line drawings depicting common Timorese landscape elements (e.g., mountains, rice paddies, coastal scenes)
   - Brief notes on key features and composition tips for each landscape type

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Online tutorials on landscape drawing techniques (where internet access is available)
2. Examples of landscape paintings by Timorese or Southeast Asian artists
3. Photography books or collections featuring Timorese landscapes
4. Nature journals or field guides to local flora, to help students understand plant forms in landscapes

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with atmospheric perspective
   - Tip: Use a simple grayscale exercise, having students create a value scale and apply it to a basic landscape

2. Challenge: Difficulty in composing balanced landscapes
   - Tip: Encourage students to start with very simple thumbnail sketches, focusing on big shapes before adding details

3. Challenge: Limited access to diverse landscape references
   - Tip: Create a classroom "landscape library" with photos, drawings, and paintings of various local scenes

4. Challenge: Students feeling overwhelmed by complex landscapes
   - Tip: Break down the drawing process into steps: start with the horizon line, then add major shapes, and gradually refine details

5. Challenge: Maintaining student engagement during longer drawing sessions
   - Tip: Incorporate short, timed exercises or "drawing games" to keep energy high and reduce pressure

6. Challenge: Students comparing their work unfavorably to others
   - Tip: Emphasize personal progress and unique interpretations, encouraging students to develop their own style
