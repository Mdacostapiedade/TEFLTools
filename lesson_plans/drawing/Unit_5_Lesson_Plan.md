Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 5: Still Life and Textures, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Still Life and Textures

## 1. Resources Needed
- Sketchbooks or drawing paper
- Pencils (various hardnesses)
- Erasers
- Charcoal
- Various textured objects (e.g., tais fabric, pottery, fruits, vegetables)
- Still life arrangement materials (table, cloth, lighting)

## 2. Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify and reproduce various textures in their drawings
- Arrange and sketch a still life composition
- Apply shading techniques to create depth and form in still life drawings

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Texture scavenger hunt: Students walk around the classroom or outdoor area, making quick sketches of 5 different textures they find (e.g., tree bark, woven basket, rough stone).

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (10 minutes)
Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Texture
- Still life
- Composition
- Contrast
- Negative space

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)
- Demonstrate various techniques for depicting textures (e.g., cross-hatching, stippling, blending)
- Explain principles of still life composition (arrangement, lighting, balance)
- Show examples of still life drawings with various textures

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)
- Texture practice: Students create a grid in their sketchbooks and fill each square with a different texture technique
- Quick sketches: Students do 3-minute sketches of individual objects with distinct textures (e.g., tais fabric, woven basket, smooth pottery)

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)
- Arrange a still life composition using local crafts and natural objects
- Students create a detailed drawing of the still life, focusing on accurately depicting textures and applying shading techniques

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Gallery walk: Students display their drawings and observe each other's work
- Group discussion: Share observations, challenges, and successes in depicting textures and composing still life

## 9. Homework Assignment
- Create a "texture journal" by collecting rubbings or sketches of 10 different textures found at home or in the community
- Sketch a still life arrangement of food items with various textures (e.g., spiky durian, smooth mango, rough coconut)

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Texture: The feel, appearance, or consistency of a surface
- Still life: A drawing or painting of an arrangement of inanimate objects
- Composition: The arrangement of elements in an artwork
- Contrast: The state of being strikingly different from something else
- Negative space: The space around and between the subjects of an image
