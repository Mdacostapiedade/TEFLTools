# Learning Unit 5: Still Life and Textures - Detailed Resources

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Texture Techniques for Different Surfaces

#### Introduction to Texture in Art
- Definition: Visual and tactile quality of a surface
- Importance in creating realistic and engaging drawings
- How texture adds depth and interest to artwork

#### Common Texture Types
1. Smooth
2. Rough
3. Soft
4. Hard
5. Shiny
6. Matte

#### Techniques for Depicting Texture
1. Hatching and Cross-hatching
   - Parallel lines for uniform textures
   - Crossing lines for more complex textures
2. Stippling
   - Using dots to create texture
   - Varying dot density for different effects
3. Scumbling
   - Loose, circular strokes for organic textures
4. Blending
   - Smooth transitions for soft textures
5. Impasto (for paint, but can be simulated with heavy pencil strokes)
   - Thick application for highly textured surfaces

#### Applying Texture Techniques to Local Objects
- Tais fabric: Cross-hatching for woven patterns
- Pottery: Combination of smooth blending and stippling for surface variations
- Natural objects (fruits, leaves): Scumbling for organic textures

### Still Life Composition and Lighting

#### Elements of Still Life Composition
1. Arrangement of objects
   - Balance and harmony
   - Creating interesting shapes and negative spaces
2. Focal point
   - Drawing the viewer's eye
   - Using contrast or unique objects
3. Perspective and scale
   - Showing depth and spatial relationships
4. Background and foreground
   - Creating context and depth

#### Lighting in Still Life
1. Light source
   - Natural vs. artificial light
   - Direction and intensity
2. Shadows and highlights
   - Creating form and depth
   - Enhancing texture
3. Contrast
   - Using light and dark to create interest and focus

#### Setting Up a Still Life
1. Choosing objects
   - Variety of shapes, sizes, and textures
   - Cultural significance (e.g., local crafts, produce)
2. Arranging the composition
   - Experimenting with different layouts
   - Considering negative space
3. Lighting setup
   - Positioning light source(s)
   - Adjusting for desired shadows and highlights

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How does texture contribute to the overall impact of a drawing? Can you think of examples where texture plays a crucial role in depicting an object or scene?

2. In what ways can artists use texture to convey emotions or atmosphere in their artwork?

3. How might the textures found in traditional Timorese crafts (like tais weaving) inspire or influence your approach to drawing?

4. Discuss the challenges of depicting various textures in a still life composition. How do you decide which textures to emphasize?

5. How does lighting affect the perception of texture in a still life? Can you think of examples where changing the lighting dramatically alters the appearance of an object's texture?

6. In what ways can the arrangement of objects in a still life composition tell a story or convey a message about Timorese culture?

7. How might you approach drawing a still life that includes both man-made objects (like pottery) and natural objects (like fruits)? What unique challenges does this combination present?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

### Texture Description Exercise

1. Choose three objects with distinctly different textures (e.g., a piece of tais fabric, a smooth stone, and a rough piece of bark).

2. Spend 5 minutes closely observing each object, focusing on its texture.

3. Write a detailed description of each object's texture, using vivid and specific language. Try to avoid using obvious texture words (like "smooth" or "rough") and instead use creative comparisons or sensory descriptions.

4. For each object, write a short paragraph (3-5 sentences) explaining how you would approach drawing its texture. What techniques would you use? What challenges do you anticipate?

5. Share your descriptions and drawing approaches with a partner, discussing similarities and differences in your observations and strategies.

## 4. Assignment Details

### Still Life Drawing with Local Objects

#### Objective
Create a detailed still life drawing that showcases various textures found in local Timorese objects.

#### Materials
- Drawing paper (A3 size recommended)
- Pencils (various hardnesses)
- Eraser
- Optional: charcoal, colored pencils

#### Instructions
1. Gather 4-6 objects that represent different aspects of Timorese culture and have varied textures. Suggestions include:
   - A piece of tais fabric
   - A handmade pottery item
   - A woven basket or hat
   - Local fruits or vegetables
   - A traditional tool or instrument

2. Arrange these objects in an interesting composition, considering balance, focal point, and negative space.

3. Set up lighting to enhance the textures and create interesting shadows.

4. Create a detailed drawing of your still life arrangement, focusing on accurately depicting the various textures.

5. Use at least three different texture techniques discussed in class (e.g., cross-hatching, stippling, blending).

6. Pay attention to the overall composition, ensuring a sense of depth and form through shading and perspective.

7. Include a short written reflection (1-2 paragraphs) discussing:
   - Your choice of objects and their cultural significance
   - The challenges you faced in depicting different textures
   - How you used composition and lighting to enhance your drawing

#### Evaluation Criteria
- Accurate depiction of objects and their textures
- Effective use of various texture techniques
- Strong composition and use of light/shadow
- Attention to detail and overall presentation
- Thoughtful reflection on the process and cultural elements
