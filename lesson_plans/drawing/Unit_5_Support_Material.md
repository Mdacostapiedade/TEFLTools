Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Still Life and Textures, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material: Still Life and Textures

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Texture**: The feel, appearance, or consistency of a surface
- **Still life**: A drawing or painting of an arrangement of inanimate objects
- **Composition**: The arrangement of elements in an artwork
- **Contrast**: The state of being strikingly different from something else
- **Negative space**: The space around and between the subjects of an image
- **Cross-hatching**: A shading technique using intersecting sets of parallel lines
- **Stippling**: A shading technique using small dots or specks
- **Blending**: A shading technique that smoothly transitions between tones
- **Form**: The three-dimensional shape of an object
- **Value**: The lightness or darkness of a color or tone

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Texture Technique Chart:
   - A 3x3 grid showing examples of different texture techniques:
     - Cross-hatching
     - Stippling
     - Blending
     - Scribbling
     - Contour hatching
     - Smudging
     - Pointillism
     - Parallel hatching
     - Circular shading

2. Still Life Composition Diagram:
   - An illustration showing the arrangement of objects in a still life:
     - Varying heights and sizes of objects
     - Overlapping elements
     - Use of negative space
     - Light source direction indicated

3. Texture Reference Sheet:
   - A collection of small sketches showing various textures:
     - Tais fabric pattern
     - Woven basket
     - Smooth pottery surface
     - Rough tree bark
     - Shiny metal object
     - Soft fabric folds

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Texture Practice Grid:
   - A worksheet with a 4x4 grid
   - Each square labeled with a different texture (e.g., "smooth", "rough", "bumpy", "silky")
   - Students practice drawing each texture in the corresponding square

2. Still Life Composition Planner:
   - A worksheet with a large empty rectangle for sketching
   - Prompts around the edges:
     - "What will be your focal point?"
     - "How will you create depth?"
     - "Where will your light source come from?"
     - "What textures will you include?"

3. Texture Scavenger Hunt Checklist:
   - A list of textures to find and sketch:
     - Something smooth
     - Something rough
     - A patterned surface
     - A shiny object
     - A soft material
     - A hard surface

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Books:
   - "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" by Betty Edwards
   - "The Natural Way to Draw" by Kimon Nicolaides

2. Online Tutorials:
   - Proko's YouTube channel for figure drawing and texture tutorials
   - Ctrl+Paint website for digital art techniques that can be applied to traditional media

3. Local Art Resources:
   - Visit the Timor-Leste National Museum for examples of traditional textures and patterns
   - Explore local markets to observe and sketch various textures in crafts and produce

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with depicting complex textures
   - Tip: Break down textures into simple patterns and shapes. Encourage students to focus on overall impression rather than every detail.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in arranging an interesting still life composition
   - Tip: Provide a variety of objects with different shapes, sizes, and textures. Demonstrate how to create depth by overlapping objects and varying their placement.

3. Challenge: Students rushing through texture exercises without careful observation
   - Tip: Incorporate timed drawing exercises to encourage focus. Start with longer observation periods and gradually reduce time as skills improve.

4. Challenge: Frustration with achieving realistic shading and form
   - Tip: Emphasize the importance of light source direction. Use simple objects like spheres to practice basic shading before moving to complex still lifes.

5. Challenge: Limited access to diverse drawing materials
   - Tip: Encourage experimentation with locally available materials (e.g., charcoal from cooking fires, natural pigments). Demonstrate how to achieve various effects with limited supplies.

6. Challenge: Students comparing their work unfavorably to others
   - Tip: Regularly discuss the value of individual artistic expression. Showcase diverse styles of still life drawings from various artists and cultures.
