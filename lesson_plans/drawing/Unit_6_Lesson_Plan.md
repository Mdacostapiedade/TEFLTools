Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 6: Figure Drawing Basics, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Figure Drawing Basics

## 1. Resources Needed
- Sketchbooks or drawing paper
- Pencils (various hardnesses)
- Erasers
- Large sheets of paper for demonstrations
- Printed references of human proportions
- Optional: Charcoal sticks

## 2. Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand and apply basic human proportions in their drawings
- Create quick gesture drawings to capture the essence of a pose
- Sketch simplified human figures with improved accuracy
- Begin to draw basic facial features and expressions

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Blind contour drawing: Students pair up and take turns drawing their partner's face without looking at their paper. This exercise helps loosen up the hand and encourages observation skills.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (10 minutes)
Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Proportion
- Gesture drawing
- Contour
- Portrait
- Expression

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Human Proportions:
   - Demonstrate the basic 8-head proportion system
   - Show how to use simple shapes to construct a figure
   - Explain variations in proportions for different ages and body types

2. Gesture Drawing:
   - Explain the purpose and technique of gesture drawing
   - Demonstrate quick 30-second and 1-minute gesture drawings

3. Facial Features and Expressions:
   - Show basic placement of facial features
   - Demonstrate how slight changes can create different expressions

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)
1. Proportion Practice:
   - Students draw stick figures using the 8-head proportion system
   - Practice drawing figures in different poses using simple shapes

2. Gesture Drawing:
   - Quick gesture drawing session with students taking turns posing
   - 30-second poses, progressing to 1-minute poses

3. Facial Features:
   - Students practice drawing individual facial features
   - Combine features to create simple face studies

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)
1. Full Figure Sketch:
   - Students create a more detailed figure drawing, applying proportions and techniques learned
   - Encourage adding simple clothing or accessories relevant to Timorese culture

2. Expression Studies:
   - Students draw a series of quick facial expressions (happy, sad, surprised, etc.)

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
- Class discussion on challenges faced and techniques found most helpful
- Quick review of key proportions and gesture drawing tips
- Preview of next lesson's focus (e.g., more detailed figure drawing)

## 9. Homework Assignment
- Practice gesture drawings of family members or people in the community (at least 10 quick sketches)
- Create two detailed portraits: one of a family member and one self-portrait
- Optional: Sketch people engaged in traditional Timorese activities or wearing traditional dress

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Proportion: The relationship of sizes between different parts of the body
- Gesture drawing: Quick, loose sketches that capture the essential movement and energy of a figure
