# Learning Unit 6: Figure Drawing Basics - Detailed Resources

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Human Proportions

#### The 8-Head Proportion System
- The average adult human figure is approximately 8 "heads" tall
- Head 1: Top of head to bottom of chin
- Heads 2-3: Chin to nipple line
- Head 4: Nipple line to navel
- Head 5: Navel to crotch
- Heads 6-7: Crotch to knee
- Head 8: Knee to bottom of feet

#### Constructing a Figure with Simple Shapes
- Use ovals for the head, ribcage, and pelvis
- Use cylinders for the neck, arms, and legs
- Use triangles for the shoulders

#### Variations in Proportions
- Children: Larger heads in proportion to body (5-6 heads tall)
- Elderly: Slightly shorter, with more pronounced curvature of the spine
- Athletic builds: Wider shoulders, narrower waist
- Different body types: Consider variations in limb length, torso width, etc.

### Gesture Drawing

#### Purpose of Gesture Drawing
- Capture the essence and energy of a pose quickly
- Focus on overall movement and flow rather than details
- Improve observation skills and hand-eye coordination

#### Technique
- Use loose, fluid lines
- Focus on the line of action (main curve of the body)
- Capture the tilt of the shoulders and hips
- Suggest major muscle groups with simple shapes

### Facial Features and Expressions

#### Placement of Facial Features
- Eyes: Approximately halfway down the head
- Nose: Halfway between eyes and chin
- Mouth: One-third of the way between nose and chin
- Ears: Between eyes and nose

#### Creating Expressions
- Happy: Upturned mouth, slightly squinted eyes
- Sad: Downturned mouth, drooping eyelids
- Surprised: Raised eyebrows, wide eyes, open mouth
- Angry: Furrowed brow, narrowed eyes, tight mouth

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How does understanding human proportions improve your figure drawing?
2. What are the benefits of gesture drawing, and how can it help improve your overall drawing skills?
3. How do cultural differences affect the way we perceive and draw human figures?
4. In what ways can you incorporate traditional Timorese clothing or accessories into your figure drawings?
5. How do facial expressions differ across cultures? Are there any specific expressions that are particularly important in Timorese culture?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

### Reflection on Cultural Representation in Figure Drawing

Write a short essay (250-300 words) reflecting on the following questions:

1. How can figure drawing be used to represent and celebrate Timorese culture?
2. What challenges might you face when drawing people from your own community, and how can you overcome them?
3. How can learning to draw human figures help you tell stories about life in Timor-Leste?

## 4. Assignment Details

### Assignment 1: Gesture Drawing Practice

- Create a series of 20 gesture drawings
- Use classmates, family members, or people in your community as subjects
- Vary the poses and include standing, sitting, and action poses
- Time each drawing: 10 at 30 seconds each, 10 at 1 minute each

### Assignment 2: Proportional Figure Study

- Draw a full-body figure using the 8-head proportion system
- Include simple shapes to construct the body
- Add basic clothing or accessories typical of Timorese culture
- Include a background sketch suggesting a local setting

### Assignment 3: Expression Studies

- Create a series of 6 facial expression studies
- Include: happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, and one expression of your choice
- Use yourself as a model (with a mirror) or draw from family members
- Write a short description of each expression and when it might be seen in daily Timorese life

## 5. Additional Materials and Examples

### Visual Aids

- Printable proportion guides showing the 8-head system
- Examples of gesture drawings at various time intervals (15 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute)
- Facial feature placement guide
- Expression reference sheet showing basic muscle movements for different emotions

### Cultural Integration Examples

- Photos of Timorese people in traditional dress for reference
- Images of people engaged in traditional Timorese activities (e.g., tais weaving, fishing, farming)
- Examples of figure drawings incorporating Timorese cultural elements

### Artist Spotlight

Brief biography and sample works of a Timorese artist known for figurative work, if available. This can serve as inspiration and show students how figure drawing can be applied to represent their own culture and experiences.

## 6. Additional Resources

- Link to online tutorials on figure drawing basics (if internet access is available)
- Suggestions for locally available books or magazines with good figure references
- Information on any local life drawing sessions or groups that students might be able to join for extra practice

This comprehensive set of resources provides a strong foundation for teaching figure drawing basics while incorporating elements of Timorese culture and encouraging students to reflect on cultural representation in their art.
