## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students feeling intimidated by drawing the human figure
   - **Solution**: Start with simple stick figures and gradually add complexity. Emphasize that everyone improves with practice.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty with proportions
   - **Solution**: Use the "measuring with a pencil" technique. Demonstrate how to use a pencil to compare sizes of body parts.

3. **Challenge**: Stiff or lifeless gesture drawings
   - **Solution**: Encourage students to focus on the overall movement and energy rather than details. Practice with very short time limits (10-15 seconds) to prevent overthinking.

4. **Challenge**: Struggling with facial features
   - **Solution**: Break down each feature into simple shapes. Practice drawing eyes, noses, and mouths separately before combining them.

5. **Challenge**: Cultural sensitivity when drawing figures
   - **Solution**: Discuss appropriate clothing and poses with students. Use references that reflect local culture and dress.

6. **Challenge**: Limited access to live models
   - **Solution**: Encourage students to practice with classmates, family members, or use online resources for timed figure drawing sessions.

7. **Challenge**: Difficulty capturing expressions
   - **Solution**: Have students practice exaggerating expressions in a mirror, then draw what they see. Use photographs of people with clear emotions as reference.
