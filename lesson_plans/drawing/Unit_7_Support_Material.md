Here's the support material for the lesson on Animals and Motion, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material: Animals and Motion

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Anatomy**: The study of the structure of the body and its parts
- **Gesture**: A quick sketch that captures the essence of a pose or movement
- **Motion lines**: Lines used in drawing to indicate the path of movement
- **Action pose**: A pose that depicts a subject in the midst of an action or movement
- **Contour**: The outline or shape of a figure or object
- **Proportion**: The relative size and scale of different parts of a subject
- **Foreshortening**: The technique of depicting an object or figure as shorter than it actually is to create the illusion of perspective
- **Negative space**: The space around and between the subject(s) of an image

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Basic Animal Anatomy Diagram:
   - Text description: A simple line drawing of a water buffalo and a rooster, with key body parts labeled (e.g., head, neck, body, legs, tail)

2. Motion Lines Illustration:
   - Text description: A series of sketches showing a rooster in different stages of crowing, with motion lines indicating the movement of the head and wings

3. Action Poses Chart:
   - Text description: A grid of simple sketches showing various animals (water buffalo, rooster, dog, cat) in different action poses (running, jumping, flying, etc.)

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Animal Proportion Guide:
   - Content: Simplified diagrams of water buffalo and rooster proportions, with guidelines for measuring and sketching basic shapes

2. Motion Study Worksheet:
   - Content: A series of blank boxes where students can sketch the same animal in different stages of movement, with space for adding motion lines

3. Animal Observation Checklist:
   - Content: A list of key features to observe and sketch for different animals (e.g., body shape, leg position, head angle, tail movement)

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Animal Anatomy for Artists" by Eliot Goldfinger
2. "The Artist's Guide to Animal Anatomy" by Bammes Gottfried
3. Online tutorial: "How to Draw Animals in Motion" on ArtTutor.com
4. YouTube channel: "Aaron Blaise" for animal drawing tutorials
5. Local wildlife guide or book featuring Timorese animals for reference

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with animal proportions
   - Tip: Encourage use of basic shapes (circles, ovals, triangles) to block out the animal's form before adding details

2. Challenge: Difficulty conveying movement in drawings
   - Tip: Practice exaggerating poses and using motion lines; analyze video clips of animals in slow motion

3. Challenge: Limited access to live animal subjects
   - Tip: Use a combination of reference images, video clips, and peer modeling (students acting out animal movements)

4. Challenge: Students focusing too much on details too early
   - Tip: Start with timed gesture drawings to capture the essence of movement before refining details

5. Challenge: Varying skill levels in the class
   - Tip: Provide additional support for struggling students while offering more complex challenges for advanced students (e.g., combining multiple animals in a scene)

6. Challenge: Cultural sensitivity regarding certain animals
   - Tip: Research and be aware of any cultural taboos or significance of specific animals in Timorese culture; focus on animals that are commonly seen and culturally neutral
