# Support Material for "Bringing It All Together"

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Composition**: The arrangement of visual elements in a work of art
- **Focal point**: The center of interest or activity in a work of art
- **Visual narrative**: A story told primarily through visual means
- **Artistic style**: The distinctive manner of expression in which an artist creates their work
- **Thumbnail sketch**: A small, quick drawing used to plan out a larger work
- **Complex scene**: A drawing that includes multiple elements and details
- **Perspective**: The technique of representing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional surface
- **Texture**: The visual and tactile quality of a surface in a drawing

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Composition Diagram:
   - A series of simple sketches showing different compositions (e.g., rule of thirds, golden ratio, symmetrical, asymmetrical)
   - Arrows and labels pointing out focal points in each composition

2. Visual Narrative Storyboard:
   - A 4-panel storyboard showing a simple visual narrative of a typical day in Timor-Leste
   - Each panel labeled with key storytelling elements (setting, character, action, conclusion)

3. Artistic Style Examples:
   - Side-by-side comparisons of the same subject (e.g., a traditional Timorese house) drawn in different artistic styles (realistic, cartoon, abstract, impressionistic)

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Composition Planning Worksheet:
   - Grid for creating 4 thumbnail sketches
   - Checklist for each sketch: focal point, balance, use of space
   - Space for notes on strengths and weaknesses of each composition

2. Visual Storytelling Prompt Sheet:
   - List of 10 aspects of life in Timor-Leste (e.g., coffee harvesting, traditional dance, market day)
   - Space to brainstorm 3-5 key scenes for each aspect
   - Guidelines for creating a visual narrative (beginning, middle, end)

3. Technique Integration Checklist:
   - List of techniques learned throughout the course (e.g., shading, perspective, texture)
   - Space to note how each technique will be used in the final complex scene

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Books:
   - "Framed Ink: Drawing and Composition for Visual Storytellers" by Marcos Mateu-Mestre
   - "The Art of Composition: A Simple Application of Dynamic Symmetry" by Michel Jacobs

2. Online Resources:
   - Skillshare course: "Storytelling Through Art: Create a Narrative Drawing"
   - YouTube channel: "Proko" for advanced drawing techniques

3. Local Resources:
   - Visit to the Timor-Leste National Museum to study traditional art compositions
   - Collaboration with local storytellers to learn about narrative structures in Timorese culture

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with complex compositions
   - Tip: Encourage breaking down the scene into simpler shapes and forms. Practice with layered tracing paper to build up complexity gradually.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in creating a focal point in busy scenes
   - Tip: Demonstrate techniques like using contrast, detail, or positioning to draw attention to the focal point. Have students experiment with different focal points in the same scene.

3. Challenge: Integrating multiple techniques cohesively
   - Tip: Create a class "technique bank" where students can refer to examples of each technique. Encourage peer teaching of techniques students feel confident in.

4. Challenge: Students feeling overwhelmed by the final project
   - Tip: Break the project into smaller, manageable tasks. Set mini-deadlines for each stage (composition, basic shapes, details, etc.).

5. Challenge: Maintaining cultural sensitivity in storytelling
   - Tip: Invite local community members or cultural experts to speak about appropriate representation of Timorese life and traditions. Encourage students to research and discuss the cultural significance of elements in their drawings.
