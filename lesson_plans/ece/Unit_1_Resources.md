## Case Study: Rural Child Care Center

Maria runs a small home-based child care center in the rural village of Aileu. She cares for 8 children aged 1-4 in her home. Maria has no formal training but has raised five children of her own. She charges families a small fee or accepts produce as payment. The children spend their day playing in Maria's yard, helping with simple chores, and learning traditional songs and stories. Maria struggles to afford educational materials and faces challenges when children become ill due to the lack of nearby medical facilities.

## Excerpt from Government Report on Child Care

"The provision of quality child care remains a significant challenge in Timor-Leste, particularly in rural areas. While urban centers have seen growth in formal child care options, rural communities continue to rely heavily on informal arrangements. This disparity raises concerns about equal access to early education opportunities and women's workforce participation. The government is committed to expanding access to quality care through initiatives such as mobile preschools and caregiver training programs."
