## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language barriers:
   - Prepare key terms in both English and Tetum
   - Use visual aids to support understanding
   - Encourage peer translation and explanation

2. Limited prior knowledge:
   - Begin with a thorough introduction to basic child care concepts
   - Use relatable examples from Timorese culture
   - Provide additional reading materials for students to review before class

3. Cultural sensitivity:
   - Acknowledge and respect traditional child-rearing practices
   - Facilitate open discussions about changing attitudes towards child care
   - Invite guest speakers from local communities to share perspectives

4. Lack of personal experience with formal child care:
   - Use role-playing activities to help students understand different perspectives
   - Organize field trips to local child care centers when possible
   - Share case studies and real-life examples from Timorese contexts

5. Difficulty accessing up-to-date statistics:
   - Collaborate with local NGOs or government agencies to obtain recent data
   - Teach students how to critically evaluate and use available data, even if not current
   - Encourage students to conduct small-scale surveys in their communities
