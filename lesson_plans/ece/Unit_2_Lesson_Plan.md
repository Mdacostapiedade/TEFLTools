# Lesson Plan: Measuring Child Care Quality in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Video clips of Timorese child care settings
- Quality rating scales (e.g. ECERS-R, CLASS) adapted for Timor-Leste context
- Handouts with key quality indicators
- Whiteboard and markers
- Laptop and projector

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify key structural and process quality indicators in child care settings
- Use a quality rating scale to assess a Timorese child care environment
- Compare and contrast different approaches to measuring child care quality

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

In pairs, students discuss:
- What does "quality" mean in child care?
- How would you know if a child care center was high-quality?

Share responses with the whole class and create a list on the whiteboard.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Structural quality
- Process quality
- Child-to-adult ratio
- Group size
- Teacher qualifications
- Teacher-child interactions

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Define and give examples of structural quality indicators:
  - Child-to-adult ratios
  - Group sizes
  - Teacher qualifications
  - Physical environment

- Explain process quality indicators:
  - Teacher-child interactions
  - Emotional support
  - Instructional support
  - Classroom organization

- Discuss quality measurement tools used in Timor-Leste:
  - Adapted versions of international scales
  - Locally developed measures

- Present challenges in measuring quality in Timorese context:
  - Cultural appropriateness
  - Resource limitations
  - Training requirements

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. In small groups, students review a handout with descriptions of different child care settings. They identify and categorize the structural and process quality indicators present.

2. Watch a short video clip of a Timorese child care setting. Using a simplified quality rating scale, students practice scoring the environment on key indicators.

3. Groups compare their ratings and discuss any differences in their assessments.

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

Debate activity: Divide the class into two teams. One team argues for using internationally standardized quality measures in Timor-Leste, while the other team advocates for developing entirely local measures. Each team prepares their arguments and presents them to the class.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the key structural and process quality indicators
- Discuss the importance of reliable quality measurement for improving child care
- Address any remaining questions from students

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students write a 1-2 page reflection on the following questions:
1. What are the most important quality indicators for child care in Timor-Leste? Why?
2. What challenges might arise in implementing quality measurement in rural areas of Timor-Leste?
3. How could quality measurement tools be adapted to be more culturally appropriate for Timor-Leste?

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Structural quality: Aspects of child care that can be regulated, such as ratios, group size, and teacher qualifications

- Child-to-adult ratio: The number of children per adult caregiver in a child care setting
- Group size: The total number of children in a classroom or care group
- Teacher qualifications: The education, training, and experience of child care providers
