Here are the support materials for the lesson on Measuring Child Care Quality in Timor-Leste:

# 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Structural quality**: Aspects of child care that can be regulated, such as ratios, group size, and teacher qualifications
- **Process quality**: The nature of interactions and experiences children have in the child care setting
- **Child-to-adult ratio**: The number of children per adult caregiver in a child care setting
- **Group size**: The total number of children in a classroom or care group
- **Teacher qualifications**: The education, training, and experience of child care providers
- **Teacher-child interactions**: The verbal and non-verbal exchanges between caregivers and children in the child care setting
- **ECERS-R**: Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised, a tool for measuring child care quality
- **CLASS**: Classroom Assessment Scoring System, another tool for measuring quality, focusing on teacher-child interactions

# 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Quality Indicators Pyramid**
   Description: A pyramid diagram with three levels:
   - Base: Structural Quality (ratios, group size, qualifications, physical environment)
   - Middle: Process Quality (interactions, emotional support, instructional support)
   - Top: Child Outcomes (learning, development, well-being)

2. **Rural vs. Urban Child Care Comparison**
   Description: A side-by-side comparison chart showing typical characteristics of rural and urban child care centers in Timor-Leste, including:
   - Average group size
   - Child-to-adult ratios
   - Teacher qualifications
   - Available resources
   - Physical environment

3. **Quality Measurement Tools Spectrum**
   Description: A horizontal spectrum showing different approaches to measuring quality:
   - Left: Internationally standardized measures (e.g., ECERS-R, CLASS)
   - Middle: Adapted international measures
   - Right: Locally developed Timorese measures

# 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Quality Indicators Checklist**
   Content: A list of key structural and process quality indicators with space for students to check off and provide examples from observed child care settings.

2. **Simplified Quality Rating Scale**
   Content: A one-page rating scale adapted for the Timorese context, covering key areas such as:
   - Safety and health practices
   - Learning environment
   - Teacher-child interactions
   - Daily routines and activities

3. **Case Study Scenarios**
   Content: Short descriptions of different Timorese child care settings, including details about ratios, group sizes, teacher qualifications, and typical daily activities. Students use these to practice identifying quality indicators.

# 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. UNICEF Timor-Leste Early Childhood Development Reports
2. World Bank studies on child care quality in developing countries
3. Online training modules on using the ECERS-R and CLASS tools
4. Academic articles on cultural adaptations of quality measurement tools
5. Videos of high-quality teacher-child interactions in various cultural contexts

# 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited exposure to formal child care settings.
   **Tip**: Provide plenty of visual examples through videos and photos. Consider arranging a field trip to a local child care center.

2. **Challenge**: Cultural differences in child-rearing practices may conflict with some international quality standards.
   **Tip**: Encourage open discussion about these differences and how quality measures might be adapted to respect local culture while promoting child development.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with the subjectivity of some quality measures.
   **Tip**: Provide clear rubrics and examples. Practice rating together as a class before individual assessments.

4. **Challenge**: Limited resources in Timorese child care settings may make some quality indicators seem unattainable.
   **Tip**: Discuss creative, low-cost solutions and emphasize the importance of quality interactions even in resource-poor environments.

5. **Challenge**: Students may have varying levels of English proficiency.
   **Tip**: Provide key terms in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and hands-on activities to support understanding.
