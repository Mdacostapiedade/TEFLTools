- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts with case study families and income data
- Calculators
- Flip chart paper and markers for group work
- Government reports on child care costs and subsidy programs in Timor-Leste

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Compare average child care costs in rural and urban areas of Timor-Leste
- Explain current government subsidy programs for child care
- Calculate child care costs as a percentage of family income

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Think-Pair-Share: Students reflect on the following questions individually, then discuss with a partner, and finally share with the class:
- How much do you think child care costs per month in Timor-Leste?
- How do you think costs might differ between rural and urban areas?
- What percentage of a family's income do you think goes towards child care?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Subsidy
- Affordability
- Income threshold

- Discuss factors influencing child care costs (e.g., staff qualifications, facility costs, regulations)
- Explore how costs impact family decision-making around child care and employment

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Small group activity: Provide case studies of different Timorese families with varying incomes and child care needs. Groups calculate child care costs as a percentage of family income and discuss the implications.

2. Whole class discussion: Compare results from different case studies and discuss how affordability varies based on family circumstances and location.

## 7. Production Task (40 minutes)

In small groups, students design an improved child care subsidy program for Timor-Leste. They should consider:

- Preview the next lesson on challenges for vulnerable populations

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students write a 1-2 page reflection paper on how child care costs and subsidies impact family decision-making in Timor-Leste. They should include at least one recommendation for improving affordability based on the lesson content.
