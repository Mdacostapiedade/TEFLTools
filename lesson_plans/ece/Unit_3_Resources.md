## Average Child Care Costs in Rural vs Urban Areas

- Urban areas:
  - Center-based care: $150-200 per month
  - Home-based care: $100-150 per month
- Rural areas:
  - Center-based care: $80-120 per month
  - Home-based care: $50-80 per month
- Factors influencing cost differences:
  - Higher operating costs in urban areas (rent, utilities)
  - Higher staff salaries in urban centers
  - Greater competition and demand in urban areas
  - Limited availability of formal care options in rural areas

## Government Subsidy Programs for Child Care in Timor-Leste

- Current programs:
  1. Income-based subsidy:
     - Eligibility: Families earning less than $300/month
     - Benefit: Up to 50% of child care costs covered
     - Application process through local government offices
  2. Rural child care center grants:
     - Provides funding to establish new centers in underserved rural areas
     - Covers up to 75% of startup costs
     - Requires commitment to serve low-income families
- Challenges with current programs:
  - Limited funding and reach
  - Complex application processes
  - Lack of awareness among eligible families

## Impact of Costs on Family Decision-Making Around Child Care

- Common family strategies:
  - Relying on extended family for care
  - Reducing work hours or leaving workforce
  - Choosing lower-quality, more affordable care options
- Long-term consequences:
  - Reduced family income and economic stability
  - Decreased women's workforce participation
  - Potential negative impacts on child development
- Factors influencing decisions:
  - Availability of extended family support
  - Cultural attitudes towards maternal employment
  - Quality and accessibility of available care options

# Discussion Questions

1. How might the cost differences between rural and urban child care impact family migration patterns in Timor-Leste?

2. What are the potential long-term economic impacts of high child care costs on Timorese families and the broader economy?

3. How could the government improve awareness and uptake of existing subsidy programs?

4. What cultural factors in Timor-Leste might influence families' willingness to use formal child care versus family-based care?

5. How might improving child care affordability impact women's workforce participation in Timor-Leste?

6. What are the potential unintended consequences of expanding child care subsidies, and how could these be mitigated?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay analyzing the impact of child care costs on a specific demographic group in Timor-Leste (e.g., single mothers, rural farmers, urban professionals). Consider the following points:

- Typical income levels and child care needs for this group
- Available child care options and their costs
- How child care expenses impact family budgets and decision-making
- Eligibility for and effectiveness of current subsidy programs
- Recommendations for policy changes to better support this group

Use specific data and examples from the lecture notes and additional research to support your analysis.

# Assignment Details

## Child Care Subsidy Program Proposal

In groups of 3-4, develop a comprehensive proposal for an improved child care subsidy program in Timor-Leste. Your proposal should include:

1. Executive Summary (200 words)
2. Background on current child care affordability challenges (300 words)
3. Proposed program structure:
   - Eligibility criteria
   - Benefit levels and structure
   - Application and disbursement process
4. Budget and funding sources (include cost estimates)
5. Implementation plan and timeline
6. Anticipated challenges and mitigation strategies
7. Monitoring and evaluation plan

The final proposal should be 2000-2500 words, professionally formatted with appropriate headings and citations. Prepare a 10-minute presentation to deliver to the class, explaining key aspects of your proposal.

## Case Study: The Silva Family

Maria and João Silva live in a rural village outside Dili with their two children, ages 2 and 4. João works as a farmer, earning about $200 per month, while Maria has been staying home to care for the children. They are considering options for Maria to return to work as a teacher, which would increase their household income to $450 per month. However, they are concerned about child care costs and quality.

The nearest child care center charges $100 per month per child, which would consume a significant portion of their potential increased income. Family members can provide some care, but not full-time. The Silvas have heard about government subsidies but are unsure if they qualify or how to apply.

Use this case study to calculate potential scenarios for the Silva family and discuss how child care costs and subsidies might impact their decision-making.

## Comparative Data: Child Care Costs as Percentage of Family Income

| Country       | Average % of Income Spent on Child Care |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Timor-Leste   | 25-30%                                 |
| Indonesia     | 20-25%                                 |
| Philippines   | 15-20%                                 |
| Australia     | 10-15%                                 |
| OECD Average  | 12%                                    |

Discuss how Timor-Leste compares to neighboring countries and developed nations in terms of child care affordability. What factors might contribute to these differences?
