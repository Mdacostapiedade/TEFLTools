# 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Bar graph comparing average monthly child care costs in rural vs. urban areas of Timor-Leste
2. Pie chart showing the breakdown of a typical family's monthly expenses, highlighting the proportion spent on child care
3. Flowchart illustrating the process of applying for and receiving child care subsidies in Timor-Leste
4. Infographic displaying key statistics on child care affordability and subsidy usage in the country

# 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Case Study Worksheet:
   - Provide 3-4 fictional Timorese family profiles with varying incomes, locations, and child care needs
   - Include a table for students to calculate child care costs as a percentage of family income
   - Add reflection questions on the impact of costs on family decision-making

2. Subsidy Program Design Template:
   - Outline key components students should consider when designing an improved subsidy program
   - Include sections for eligibility criteria, benefit levels, funding sources, and implementation challenges
   - Provide space for students to sketch out their program design and explain their rationale

# 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice
