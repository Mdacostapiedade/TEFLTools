# Discussion Questions

1. How do geographic barriers in rural Timor-Leste differ from those in urban areas? What unique solutions might be effective in addressing rural child care access?

2. In what ways might financial challenges impact a family's decision-making process when it comes to child care? Consider both short-term and long-term consequences.

3. How can child care providers balance the need for quality standards with cultural sensitivity? Discuss potential conflicts and strategies for resolution.

4. What role should the government play in addressing child care access for vulnerable populations? Consider both financial support and policy interventions.

5. How might improving child care access for vulnerable populations contribute to broader economic and social development in Timor-Leste?

6. Discuss the potential long-term impacts of linguistic barriers in early childhood care on a child's development and future educational outcomes.

7. How can community-based solutions be leveraged to address child care challenges for vulnerable populations? Provide specific examples that might work in the Timorese context.

8. What are some potential unintended consequences of interventions aimed at improving child care access for vulnerable populations? How might these be mitigated?

   - Center-based care options
   - Home-based care providers
   - Informal care networks

3. Information on financial assistance programs:
   - Government subsidies
   - NGO support programs

7. Contact information for relevant government offices, NGOs, and community organizations.

8. A FAQ section addressing common concerns and questions from vulnerable families.

Format your guide in a clear, easy-to-read layout. Use simple language and consider including visual aids where appropriate. The guide should be approximately 5-7 pages long.

# Assignment Details

## Parent Interview Assignment

Conduct an interview with a parent or guardian about their experiences with accessing child care in Timor-Leste. Follow these steps:

1. Identify a parent or guardian willing to be interviewed. They should be from one of the vulnerable populations discussed in class (e.g., low-income, single parent, rural resident, linguistic minority).

2. Develop 5-7 interview questions focusing on:
   - Challenges faced in accessing quality child care
   - Strategies used to overcome these challenges
   - Impact of child care access on family life and employment
   - Experiences with cultural or linguistic barriers in child care settings
   - Suggestions for improving child care access for vulnerable populations

3. Conduct the interview, taking detailed notes or recording with permission.

4. Write a 1-page summary of your findings, including:
   - Brief background on the interviewee (maintaining anonymity)
   - Key challenges identified
   - Strategies or resources used by the family
   - Insights gained from the interview
   - Your reflections on how the interview connects to course concepts

5. Prepare a short (3-5 minute) presentation to share your key findings with the class.

Submit your written summary and be prepared to present in the next class session.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Rural Single Mother

Maria is a single mother living in a remote village in Timor-Leste. She has two children, ages 2 and 4, and works as a subsistence farmer. The nearest child care center is 15 kilometers away, and there is no public transportation available. Maria cannot afford a motorbike, and the road to the center is often impassable during the rainy season.

### Case Study 2: Urban Low-Income Family

The Santos family lives in a densely populated neighborhood of Dili. Both parents work long hours in the informal economy to make ends meet. They have three children under the age of 5. While there are several child care centers nearby, the cost of enrolling all three children would consume nearly 70% of their monthly income.

### Case Study 3: Linguistic Minority Family

The Soares family belongs to the Fataluku-speaking minority in Timor-Leste. They recently moved to a Tetum-speaking area for work opportunities. Their 3-year-old daughter needs child care, but the local centers operate primarily in Tetum and Portuguese. The parents are concerned about their daughter's language development and cultural identity.

## Relevant Statistics

- Percentage of population living below the poverty line in Timor-Leste: 41.8% (2014 data)
- Rural population of Timor-Leste: 69.4% (2020 data)
- Number of official languages in Timor-Leste: 2 (Tetum and Portuguese)
- Number of indigenous languages spoken: 32
- Percentage of children under 5 attending early childhood education programs: 17% (2016 data)
