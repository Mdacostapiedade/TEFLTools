## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barriers**: 
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of English proficiency.
   - Solution: Provide key terms in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids to support understanding.

2. **Limited Personal Experience**: 
   - Challenge: Some students may have limited exposure to formal child care systems.
   - Solution: Begin with a discussion of traditional child-rearing practices to build a bridge to formal child care concepts.

3. **Sensitivity to Economic Disparities**: 
   - Challenge: Discussions about financial constraints may be sensitive for some students.
   - Solution: Use hypothetical scenarios and emphasize systemic issues rather than individual circumstances.

4. **Rural-Urban Divide**: 
   - Challenge: Students from urban areas may lack understanding of rural challenges.
   - Solution: If possible, organize a field trip to a rural area or invite guest speakers from rural communities.

5. **Cultural Competence**: 
   - Challenge: Ensuring respectful discussion of diverse cultural practices.
   - Solution: Establish ground rules for respectful dialogue and model cultural sensitivity in your language and examples.
