   - Offer support and guidance during the activity

4. Lack of familiarity with policy-making processes:
   - Provide a brief overview of how policies are developed in Timor-Leste
   - Share examples of successful advocacy campaigns in similar contexts
   - Break down the policy recommendation task into smaller, manageable steps

5. Limited access to technology for research:
   - Prepare printed resources for students to use during class
   - Organize small group research sessions using shared computers
   - Encourage students to use smartphones for research if available

6. Varying levels of experience with child care:
