# 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited data on child care in Timor-Leste
   - Solution: Encourage students to conduct small-scale surveys or interviews to gather primary data. Use comparative data from similar countries when Timor-Leste specific data is unavailable.

2. Challenge: Students may lack experience with policy analysis
   - Solution: Provide step-by-step guidance and examples of policy analysis. Use scaffolding techniques to build skills gradually.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in understanding the complexities of rural-urban differences
   - Solution: Organize field trips to both rural and urban child care centers if possible. Use case studies and guest speakers to bring real-world context.

4. Challenge: Students may feel overwhelmed by the scope of child care issues
   - Solution: Break down topics into manageable parts. Encourage students to focus on specific aspects of child care for their projects.

5. Challenge: Language barriers in accessing international resources
   - Solution: Provide translated summaries of key international documents. Pair students with stronger English skills with those who need support.

6. Challenge: Lack of familiarity with advocacy techniques
   - Solution: Use role-playing exercises to practice advocacy skills. Invite local advocates as guest speakers to share real-world experiences.
