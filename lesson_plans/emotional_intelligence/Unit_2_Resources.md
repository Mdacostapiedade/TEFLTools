## Case Study: The Impact of the 1999 Referendum

Maria, now 35, was a teenager living in Dili during the 1999 independence referendum. Her family's home was burned down by militia groups, and they were forced to flee to the mountains. For weeks, they lived in fear, with little food or water. After returning to Dili, Maria struggled with nightmares and found it difficult to trust others. She often felt jumpy and on edge, especially around loud noises.

Years later, Maria noticed that she had trouble forming close relationships and would sometimes lash out in anger at her children. She began to recognize similar behaviors in her parents and other community members. Through counseling and community support groups, Maria started to understand how her past experiences were affecting her present life and relationships.

Questions for analysis:
1. What symptoms of trauma can you identify in Maria's story?
2. How might Maria's experiences have affected her parenting and family dynamics?
3. What aspects of intergenerational trauma are evident in this case?
4. What cultural factors might influence Maria's healing process?
5. How could trauma-informed care principles be applied to support Maria and her community?
