# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Implementing Trauma-Informed Care in a Timorese Health Clinic

Background:
A small health clinic in rural Timor-Leste is seeking to implement trauma-informed care principles. The clinic serves a population that has experienced significant trauma during the Indonesian occupation and subsequent conflicts. Many patients are hesitant to seek mental health support due to stigma and traditional beliefs about healing.

Challenges:
- Limited resources and staff training
- Language barriers (multiple local dialects)
- Integration of traditional healing practices
- Addressing intergenerational trauma

Task:
In small groups, discuss how you would approach implementing trauma-informed care in this clinic. Consider the following questions:

1. How would you create a physically and emotionally safe environment for patients?
2. What steps would you take to build trust with the local community?
3. How can patient choice be incorporated into treatment options?
4. What collaborative approaches could be used with traditional healers?
5. How might you empower patients and the community in the healing process?

Prepare a brief presentation of your ideas to share with the class.

## Role-Play Scenario Cards

1. A young woman comes to the clinic experiencing nightmares and flashbacks related to witnessing violence during the 1999 referendum. She is hesitant to speak about her experiences.

2. An elder in the community is resistant to the idea of trauma-informed care, believing it conflicts with traditional healing practices.

3. A group of children who have lost parents to conflict-related violence are struggling in school. The teacher seeks advice on creating a trauma-informed classroom.

4. A former resistance fighter experiences anger outbursts and has difficulty maintaining employment. His family is concerned but unsure how to help.

5. A community leader wants to incorporate trauma-informed principles into local dispute resolution practices but is unsure how to begin.

Instructions: In pairs, act out a conversation between a care provider and the individual(s) described in the scenario. Demonstrate the application of trauma-informed care principles while respecting Timorese cultural norms.
