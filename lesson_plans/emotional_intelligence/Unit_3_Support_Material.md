## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barriers**
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of proficiency in the language of instruction.
   - Solution: Provide key terms in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and demonstrations to support verbal explanations.

2. **Cultural Sensitivity**
   - Challenge: Some trauma-informed practices may conflict with traditional Timorese beliefs or customs.
   - Solution: Encourage open discussion about cultural differences. Emphasize adapting principles to fit local contexts rather than replacing traditional practices.

3. **Personal Trauma Triggers**
   - Challenge: Discussing trauma may trigger emotional responses in students with personal trauma histories.
   - Solution: Establish clear ground rules for discussions. Provide options for students to step out if needed. Have resources available for additional support.

4. **Limited Resources in Local Context**
   - Challenge: Students may struggle to envision implementing trauma-informed care with limited resources.
   - Solution: Focus on low-cost, high-impact strategies. Encourage creative problem-solving and community-based solutions.

5. **Resistance to Change**
   - Challenge: Students may encounter resistance when trying to implement new practices in their workplaces or communities.
   - Solution: Role-play scenarios addressing resistance. Discuss strategies for gradual implementation and building buy-in from stakeholders.

6. **Balancing Theory and Practice**
   - Challenge: Ensuring students can apply theoretical concepts in real-world Timorese contexts.
   - Solution: Use plenty of local case studies and examples. Incorporate hands-on activities and community engagement opportunities.
