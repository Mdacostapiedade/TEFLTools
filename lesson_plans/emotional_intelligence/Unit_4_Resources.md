### Guided Meditation Script: Timorese Mountain Serenity

Close your eyes and take a deep breath. Imagine yourself at the base of Mount Ramelau, Timor-Leste's highest peak. Feel the cool mountain air on your skin. With each breath, picture yourself climbing higher up the mountain.

As you ascend, notice the lush vegetation around you. The scent of wild flowers fills the air. Listen to the distant sound of birds singing their morning songs. With each step, feel your connection to the land growing stronger.

You reach a clearing and pause to look out over the landscape. The sun is rising, casting a golden light across the valleys below. In the distance, you can see the glittering sea that surrounds our island nation.

Take a moment to reflect on the strength of these mountains. They have stood for millennia, weathering storms and changes. Like these mountains, you too have an inner strength and resilience.

As you continue your journey to the summit, feel the support of the earth beneath your feet. Just as the mountain is supported by its strong foundation, remember that you are supported by your community, your culture, and your ancestors.

Reaching the peak, you feel a sense of accomplishment and peace. The cool breeze carries away any worries or stress. Breathe in the clean mountain air, filling your lungs and your spirit with renewed energy.

As you prepare to descend, carry with you the strength and serenity of Mount Ramelau. Know that you can return to this place of calm whenever you need to, simply by closing your eyes and taking a deep breath.

Slowly open your eyes, bringing your awareness back to the present moment, feeling refreshed and resilient.

### Example: Social Support Mapping Activity

Create a visual representation of your social support network using the following steps:

1. Draw a circle in the center of a piece of paper and write your name in it.

2. Around this circle, draw other circles representing different categories of support:
   - Family
   - Friends
   - Community members
   - Colleagues or classmates
   - Spiritual or religious connections
   - Professional support (e.g., teachers, mentors, counselors)

3. Within each category, write the names of specific individuals or groups that provide support.

4. Use different colors or line styles to indicate the strength or type of support (e.g., emotional, practical, informational).

5. Add arrows to show the direction of support (one-way or reciprocal).

6. Identify any gaps or areas where you'd like to strengthen your support network.

7. Reflect on how you can nurture and expand your social connections to enhance your resilience.
