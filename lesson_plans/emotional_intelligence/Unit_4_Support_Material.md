2. **Challenge**: Some participants may have experienced severe trauma.
   **Solution**: Be prepared with resources for professional support. Emphasize that participation in sharing activities is voluntary.

   **Solution**: Encourage open discussion about potential conflicts and focus on finding complementary aspects. Emphasize the value of both approaches.

4. **Challenge**: Language barriers in understanding complex emotional concepts.
   **Solution**: Use visual aids, role-playing, and concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts. Provide materials in both Tetum and English if possible.

5. **Challenge**: Resistance to mindfulness practices due to cultural or religious beliefs.
