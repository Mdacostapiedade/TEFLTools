# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Maria's Journey to Healing

Maria, a 35-year-old Timorese woman, has been experiencing persistent sadness, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping since her father's death six months ago. Her family is concerned because she has stopped participating in community events and rarely leaves her home. They have tried traditional remedies, including herbal teas and prayers at the uma lulik, but Maria's condition hasn't improved.

Maria's brother suggests she see a psychologist at the local health clinic, but her mother insists that a matan-dook should be consulted first to ensure there are no spiritual issues causing Maria's distress.

Use this case study for group discussions and role-playing exercises to practice culturally competent approaches to emotional support.
