## Community Needs Assessment for Emotional Support

### What is a Community Needs Assessment?
- A systematic process to identify and address needs or "gaps" between current conditions and desired conditions in a community
- Focuses on the strengths and resources of the community to meet the identified needs

### Steps in Conducting a Community Needs Assessment
1. Define and describe the community
2. Gather existing data
3. Decide on additional data needed and collection methods
4. Collect new data
5. Analyze and interpret the data
6. Set priorities and develop an action plan

### Methods for Data Collection
- Surveys
- Interviews
- Focus groups
- Community forums
- Observation
- Review of existing records and reports

### Considerations for Timor-Leste Context
- Language barriers: Prepare materials in Tetum and local languages
- Literacy levels: Use visual aids and oral communication methods
- Cultural sensitivity: Respect local customs and hierarchies
- Trust-building: Work with local leaders and community gatekeepers

## Designing and Implementing Emotional Intelligence Workshops

### Key Components of an Effective Workshop
1. Clear objectives
2. Interactive activities
3. Culturally relevant content
4. Opportunities for practice and reflection
5. Follow-up support

### Workshop Design Process
1. Assess participant needs and background
2. Set specific, measurable objectives
3. Develop content and activities
4. Create materials and handouts
5. Plan for evaluation and feedback

### Implementing Workshops in Timor-Leste
- Use local facilitators or co-facilitate with local partners
- Incorporate traditional stories, proverbs, and cultural references
- Address potential barriers to participation (e.g., childcare, transportation)
- Consider gender dynamics and ensure equal participation opportunities

### Evaluation and Continuous Improvement
- Gather participant feedback
- Measure changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors
- Adapt content and delivery based on evaluation results
