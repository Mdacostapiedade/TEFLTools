# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "Women Who Run With the Wolves" (translated into Tetum)

> "A saudável mulher selvagem é muitas coisas e estas residem nela. Ela é criativa, ela é intuitiva, ela tem um senso de lealdade, ela é inventiva. Ela adapta-se bem, ela é apaixonada e compassiva. Ela é protetora de si mesma, de suas crias, de suas ideias, de suas criações."

> "The healthy Wild Woman is many things, and these reside within her. She is creative, she is intuitive, she has a sense of loyalty, she is inventive. She adapts well, she is passionate and compassionate. She is a protector of herself, her offspring, her ideas, her creations."

## Timorese Folktale: "The Brave Daughter of Ramelau"

Long ago, in the shadow of Mount Ramelau, there lived a young woman named Bui. She was known for her strength and her ability to communicate with the spirits of the mountain. One day, a great drought struck the land, and the crops began to wither. The village elders decided to send their strongest warrior to the peak of Ramelau to ask the mountain spirits for rain.

Bui, knowing she was the one who could best speak to the spirits, volunteered. The elders refused, saying it was not a woman's place. But Bui, listening to her inner voice, set out in secret during the night.

The journey was treacherous, with steep cliffs and dangerous beasts, but Bui's instincts guided her safely. At the summit, she called to the spirits, dancing and singing with wild abandon. The spirits, moved by her passion and courage, sent rain clouds rolling down the mountainside.

When Bui returned to the village, the elders saw her wisdom and strength. From that day forward, they sought her counsel in all important matters, and the story of the brave daughter of Ramelau was told for generations.
