## Timorese Creation Myth: The Birth of the Island

Long ago, when the world was young, there was only the vast ocean and the sky above. In the depths of the sea lived a giant crocodile, ancient and wise. One day, the crocodile grew tired of swimming endlessly in the dark waters and longed to rest.

As he swam towards the surface, his great body began to transform. His scales became rough and jagged, his tail stretched and widened. When he finally breached the surface, he had become the island of Timor.

The crocodile's body formed the mountains and valleys, his scales became the lush forests, and his tears of joy at finally resting became the rivers and streams. From his last breath, the first Timorese people were born, strong and resilient like the crocodile himself.

To this day, the people of Timor-Leste honor the crocodile as their ancestor and protector, recognizing the deep connection between their land, their people, and the natural world.

## Excerpt from "Women Who Run With the Wolves" by Clarissa Pinkola Est√©s

"To be strong does not mean to sprout muscles and flex. It means meeting one's own numinosity without fleeing, actively living with the wild nature in one's own way. It means to be able to learn, to be able to stand what we know. It means to stand and live."

## Guided Meditation Script: Connecting with Your Inner Wild Woman

Find a comfortable seated position and close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths, allowing your body to relax and your mind to quiet.

Imagine yourself walking along a forest path. The air is warm and fragrant with the scent of earth and flowers. As you walk, you feel the ground beneath your feet, solid and supportive.

You come to a clearing where a ancient tree stands. Its trunk is wide and gnarled, its branches reaching up to the sky. You feel drawn to this tree, sensing its deep wisdom.

As you approach, you notice a hollow in the trunk. Peering inside, you see a soft glow. Trusting your instincts, you step into the hollow.

Inside, you find yourself in a sacred cave. The walls shimmer with crystals, and a small stream trickles through the center. Sitting by the stream is a figure - your Inner Wild Woman.

She may appear as an old crone, a fierce warrior, or a nurturing mother. However she appears, you know she embodies your deepest wisdom and power.

Approach her and sit nearby. What does she want to tell you? What wisdom does she have to share? Listen with your heart and your intuition.

When you're ready, thank your Wild Woman and make your way back through the tree hollow to the forest clearing.

Take a few deep breaths, wiggle your fingers and toes, and slowly open your eyes.

## Intuition Development Exercise: The Wisdom of Objects

Materials needed: A collection of small objects (natural items, trinkets, etc.), one per participant

1. Arrange participants in a circle, each with their eyes closed.

2. Place a small object in each person's hands.

3. Instruct participants to explore the object with their hands, without looking at it. As they do so, ask them to pay attention to any thoughts, feelings, or images that arise.

4. After a few minutes, have participants share what they sensed about the object and its "story" or significance.

5. Finally, allow participants to open their eyes and look at their objects.

6. Discuss as a group:
   - How close were your intuitive impressions to the actual object?
   - What surprised you about this exercise?
   - How might you apply this kind of intuitive sensing in daily life?
