## Timorese Folktale: The Weaver and the Rainbow

Long ago, in the mountains of Timor-Leste, there lived a young woman named Bui. She was known throughout her village for her skill in weaving tais, the traditional cloth of her people. Bui's tais were not only beautiful but were said to hold magic within their threads.

One day, as Bui sat at her loom, she noticed the colors around her seemed dull and lifeless. She longed to weave a tais that would bring vibrant color back to the world. As she worked, she began to sing, pouring her heart into her voice and her weaving.

As Bui sang and wove, the sky darkened and rain began to fall. But Bui didn't stop. She wove faster and sang louder, her voice rising above the storm. Suddenly, a brilliant rainbow appeared, arching across the sky.

Inspired, Bui quickly gathered threads that matched the rainbow's colors. She wove day and night, capturing the rainbow's beauty in her tais. When she finished, the cloth shimmered with all the colors of the rainbow.

From that day forward, Bui's rainbow tais brought color and joy to all who saw it. The people said that Bui had woven the spirit of the rainbow itself into her cloth, reminding them that even after the darkest storms, beauty and color would always return to the world.
