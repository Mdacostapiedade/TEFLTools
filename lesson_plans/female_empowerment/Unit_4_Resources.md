# Excerpts and Short Stories

## "The Skeleton Woman" from "Women Who Run With the Wolves" by Clarissa Pinkola Est√©s

Once there was a woman who died and was buried in the sea. A fisherman, unaware of her presence, caught her bones in his net. Terrified by the sight of the skeleton, he tried to flee, but the skeleton woman was tangled in his line and followed him. In his panic, he ran home, dragging her behind him.

When he finally stopped and looked at her, he saw not a fearsome creature, but a woman in need. He untangled her and, with great care, put her bones back together. As he slept, she drank the tear that had fallen from his eye, which gave her flesh and life once more. They embraced, and in that moment, both were transformed by the power of love and the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

## Timorese Folktale: "The Origin of the Crocodile"

Long ago, there was an old woman who lived alone by the river. One day, she found a small, strange creature near her home. Taking pity on it, she decided to care for it. As time passed, the creature grew larger and larger, eventually becoming a crocodile.

The old woman continued to care for the crocodile, even as it outgrew her home. One day, the crocodile spoke to her, saying, "Mother, you have cared for me all this time, but now I must return to the sea. In gratitude, I promise that your descendants will always be safe in the water, and I will help them cross rivers and seas."

The old woman bid farewell to the crocodile, and it swam away. From that day forward, the Timorese people have regarded crocodiles as sacred creatures, embodying the spirit of their ancestors and the cycle of life and death.
