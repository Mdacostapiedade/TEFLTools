## Timorese Folktale: The Weaver and the Mountain Spirit

Long ago in the mountains of Timor-Leste, there lived a young woman named Lita who was renowned for her skill in weaving tais, the traditional cloth of her people. Lita's tais were so beautiful that people said they must be woven with magic.

One day, as Lita was collecting dyes from plants on the mountainside, she encountered a spirit of the mountain. The spirit was impressed by Lita's respect for nature and her artistic talent.

"Lita," said the spirit, "I will grant you a wish. What do you desire?"

Lita thought carefully. She knew that many would ask for wealth or power, but she had a different dream. "Spirit of the mountain," she said, "I wish for the wisdom to weave stories of our people that will never be forgotten."

The spirit smiled and granted her wish. From that day forward, Lita's tais became even more extraordinary. Each one told a story of Timorese culture, history, and dreams for the future. People came from far and wide to see and learn from her work.

As Lita grew older, she taught other young women her art, passing on not just the techniques of weaving, but the importance of preserving and sharing their cultural stories. Through her courage to ask for wisdom rather than material gain, Lita became a respected elder, known as the Keeper of Stories.

To this day, the intricate patterns of Timorese tais continue to tell the tales of their people, a living legacy of Lita's wish and the mountain spirit's gift.
