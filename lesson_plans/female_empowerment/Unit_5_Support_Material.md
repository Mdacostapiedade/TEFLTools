## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may be hesitant to share personal experiences.
   **Solution**: Create a safe, non-judgmental environment. Start with less personal examples and gradually move to more personal ones. Allow students to share anonymously if needed.

2. **Challenge**: Cultural sensitivity when discussing traditional expectations.
   **Solution**: Emphasize respect for culture while encouraging critical thinking. Use local examples and invite guest speakers from the community to provide balanced perspectives.

3. **Challenge**: Resistance to change or new ideas.
   **Solution**: Present change as a gradual process. Highlight examples of successful Timorese women who have balanced tradition and personal growth.

4. **Challenge**: Varying levels of assertiveness among students.
   **Solution**: Use pair and small group activities to allow less assertive students to practice in a more comfortable setting. Provide extra support and encouragement to these students.

5. **Challenge**: Difficulty in applying concepts to real-life situations.
   **Solution**: Use plenty of relevant, local examples. Encourage students to start with small, achievable goals. Follow up in subsequent lessons to discuss progress and challenges.

6. **Challenge**: Language barriers in understanding complex concepts.
   **Solution**: Use simple language and plenty of visual aids. Encourage peer explanation and translation. Provide handouts with key terms and concepts in both English and Tetum.
