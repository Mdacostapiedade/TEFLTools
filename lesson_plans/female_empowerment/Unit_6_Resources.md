# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Timorese Folktale: "The Crocodile and the Girl"

Once, there was a young girl who lived by the sea. One day, she found a small crocodile stranded on the beach. Taking pity on it, she carried it back to the water. The crocodile, grateful for her kindness, offered to take her on a journey across the sea. As they traveled, the crocodile grew larger, eventually becoming the island of Timor. The girl became the ancestor of the Timorese people, her compassion and bravery shaping the land and its inhabitants.
