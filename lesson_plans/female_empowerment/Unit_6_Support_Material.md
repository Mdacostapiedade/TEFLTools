## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Participants may be hesitant to share personal experiences.
   **Solution**: Start with low-stakes sharing activities and gradually build trust within the group. Emphasize confidentiality and respect for all experiences shared.

2. **Challenge**: Some participants may dominate discussions.
   **Solution**: Use structured turn-taking techniques, such as talking sticks or timed sharing, to ensure equal participation.

3. **Challenge**: Conflict between traditional values and empowerment concepts.
   **Solution**: Acknowledge the importance of cultural heritage while encouraging critical thinking. Frame empowerment as a way to honor and strengthen cultural values.

4. **Challenge**: Varying literacy levels among participants.
   **Solution**: Use a mix of verbal, visual, and kinesthetic learning activities. Encourage peer support and offer one-on-one assistance when needed.

5. **Challenge**: Limited access to technology for follow-up or networking.
   **Solution**: Focus on in-person networking strategies and provide printed resources. Explore low-tech solutions for staying connected, such as regular meet-ups or a community bulletin board.

6. **Challenge**: Resistance from family or community members.
   **Solution**: Invite supportive family and community members to an open session to learn about the program. Emphasize how women's empowerment benefits the entire community.
