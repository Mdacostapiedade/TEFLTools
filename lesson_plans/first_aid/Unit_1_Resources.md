## Principles of First Aid

### Definition and Importance
- First aid is the immediate care given to a person who has been injured or suddenly taken ill, before professional medical help arrives.
- In Timor-Leste, first aid is crucial due to:
  - Limited access to healthcare facilities in rural areas
  - High rates of road accidents and natural disasters
  - Prevalence of tropical diseases and environmental hazards

### The "Three P's" of First Aid
1. Preserve life
   - Ensure scene safety
   - Check for responsiveness and breathing
   - Call for help
   - Perform CPR if necessary
2. Prevent further injury
   - Immobilize fractures
   - Control bleeding
   - Prevent shock
3. Promote recovery
   - Provide comfort and reassurance
   - Monitor vital signs
   - Protect from elements

### Adapting First Aid Principles to Timor-Leste's Context
- Use locally available materials for improvised first aid supplies
- Consider cultural sensitivities when providing care
- Integrate traditional healing practices when appropriate and safe
- Address language barriers in emergency communication

## Timor-Leste's Healthcare System

### Healthcare Structure
1. National level
   - Ministry of Health
   - National hospitals in Dili
2. District level

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Good Samaritan Laws
- Timor-Leste's legal framework for protecting first aiders
- Duty to assist within one's capabilities
- Protection from liability when acting in good faith

### Consent and Confidentiality
- Obtaining consent before providing care

## Case Study: First Aid in a Remote Village

Maria, a trained first aider, is visiting her family in a remote village in Timor-Leste when a young boy falls from a tree and breaks his arm. The nearest hospital is several hours away, and there is no ambulance service available. Maria must use her first aid skills and locally available resources to stabilize the boy's injury and arrange for transportation to the hospital.

Discuss:
1. What immediate first aid should Maria provide?
2. How can she improvise a splint using local materials?
3. What cultural considerations should she be aware of when providing care?
4. How can she effectively communicate with the boy's family and arrange transportation?
5. What follow-up care instructions should she provide?
