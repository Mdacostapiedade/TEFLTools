# Lesson Plan: Assessing Emergency Situations

## Resources Needed
- First aid manual (in Tetum and English)
- Basic first aid kit
- Projector and screen
- Whiteboard and markers
- Printed handouts of emergency scenarios
- Mock emergency scene props (e.g., fake blood, bandages)
- Transportation for field trip

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Conduct a thorough scene safety assessment
2. Perform primary and secondary surveys on a patient
3. Understand and apply the "Three P's" of first aid in the Timorese context
4. Demonstrate basic triage skills in a simulated mass casualty incident

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Quick-fire question round: Instructor calls out various emergency scenarios, students respond with the first safety consideration that comes to mind.

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)
- Introduce and explain key terms:
  * Scene safety
  * Primary survey
  * Secondary survey
  * Triage
  * The "Three P's": Preserve life, Prevent further injury, Promote recovery
- Have students repeat terms in Tetum and English

## Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Scene Safety Assessment (15 minutes)
- Explain the importance of scene safety
- Discuss potential hazards in Timorese contexts (e.g., unstable structures, wildlife)
- Demonstrate a scene safety assessment

### Primary and Secondary Surveys (20 minutes)
- Explain the difference between primary and secondary surveys
- Demonstrate a primary survey (ABCDE: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure)
- Demonstrate a secondary survey (head-to-toe examination)

### Triage in Mass Casualty Incidents (10 minutes)
- Explain the concept of triage
- Discuss the START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) method
- Relate triage to potential mass casualty scenarios in Timor-Leste

## Practice Activities (60 minutes)

### Activity 1: Scene Safety Role-play (20 minutes)
- In pairs, students take turns assessing mock emergency scenes
- Scenarios include common Timorese settings (e.g., rural village, urban market)

### Activity 2: Primary and Secondary Survey Practice (20 minutes)
- In groups of three, students practice primary and secondary surveys
- One student acts as patient, one as first aider, one as observer

### Activity 3: Triage Simulation (20 minutes)
- Set up a simulated mass casualty incident
- Students practice rapid triage decisions using the START method

## Production Task (30 minutes)
- In small groups, students create and present a safety briefing for a community event in Timor-Leste
- Briefing should include scene safety considerations and basic emergency response procedures

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Quick quiz on key concepts covered
- Address any questions or concerns from students
- Recap the importance of thorough assessment in emergency situations

## Homework Assignment
1. Read the chapter on emergency assessment in the first aid manual
2. Write a one-page reflection on potential safety hazards in their local community
3. Prepare questions for the upcoming field trip to a local health clinic or hospital emergency department

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Scene safety: The process of identifying and mitigating potential hazards at an emergency site
- Primary survey: A quick assessment of a patient's vital functions (ABCDE)
- Secondary survey: A more detailed head-to-toe examination of a patient
- Triage: The process of sorting patients based on the urgency of their need for care
- START method: Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment, a system for quickly assessing patients in mass casualty incidents
- The "Three P's": Preserve life, Prevent further injury, Promote recovery - the core principles of first aid
