## Scene Safety Assessment

### Introduction
- Definition: Scene safety assessment is the process of identifying and mitigating potential hazards at an emergency site before providing care.
- Importance: Ensures the safety of the first responder, the patient, and bystanders.

### Key Steps in Scene Safety Assessment
1. Approach with caution
2. Look for immediate dangers
3. Assess for additional hazards
4. Determine the number of patients
5. Consider the need for additional resources
6. Identify the mechanism of injury or nature of illness

### Common Hazards in Timor-Leste
- Unstable structures (especially in rural areas)
- Wildlife (snakes, insects)
- Environmental hazards (flooding, landslides)
- Traffic (in urban areas)
- Potential violence or civil unrest

### Conducting a Scene Safety Assessment
1. Stop at a safe distance and observe the scene
2. Look for signs of danger (fire, electrical hazards, unstable structures)
3. Listen for unusual sounds (hissing gas, creaking buildings)
4. Smell for unusual odors (gas, chemicals)
5. Assess the stability of the ground and surrounding structures
6. Identify potential escape routes
7. Determine if personal protective equipment is needed

## Primary and Secondary Surveys

### Primary Survey (ABCDE)
- Purpose: Quickly assess and address life-threatening conditions
- Steps:
  1. Airway: Check if the airway is open and clear
  2. Breathing: Look, listen, and feel for breathing
  3. Circulation: Check pulse and look for severe bleeding
  4. Disability: Assess level of consciousness (AVPU scale)
  5. Exposure: Expose and examine for other injuries

### Secondary Survey
- Purpose: Conduct a more thorough head-to-toe examination
- Steps:
  1. Obtain consent (if patient is conscious)
  2. Gather patient history (SAMPLE: Signs/Symptoms, Allergies, Medications, Past medical history, Last meal, Events leading to injury/illness)
  3. Perform head-to-toe examination
  4. Check vital signs (pulse, respiration, blood pressure if equipment available)
  5. Continually reassess ABCDE

### The "Three P's" of First Aid in Timorese Context
1. Preserve life: Focus on immediate life-saving interventions
2. Prevent further injury: Stabilize the patient and prevent complications
3. Promote recovery: Provide comfort and support, arrange for further care

## Triage in Mass Casualty Incidents

### Introduction to Triage
- Definition: The process of sorting patients based on the urgency of their need for care
- Purpose: Maximize the number of survivors in a mass casualty incident

### START Method (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment)
- Used for rapid assessment in mass casualty incidents
- Categories:
  1. Red (Immediate): Life-threatening injuries requiring immediate care
  2. Yellow (Delayed): Serious injuries, but not immediately life-threatening
  3. Green (Minor): Walking wounded, can wait for care
  4. Black (Deceased): No signs of life

### Triage Process
1. Direct walking wounded to a designated area (Green)
2. Assess remaining patients:
   - Check breathing: If not breathing after opening airway, classify as Black
   - Check respiration rate: >30/min classify as Red
   - Check perfusion: No radial pulse or capillary refill >2 seconds, classify as Red
   - Check mental status: Unable to follow simple commands, classify as Red
3. Reassess and adjust classifications as needed

### Triage Considerations in Timor-Leste
- Limited medical resources may affect triage decisions
- Cultural sensitivities around handling the deceased
- Potential language barriers in diverse communities

# Discussion Questions

1. How might scene safety assessments differ between urban and rural areas of Timor-Leste?
2. What cultural considerations should be taken into account when performing primary and secondary surveys on patients in Timor-Leste?
3. How can the "Three P's" of first aid be adapted to better suit the Timorese context?
4. In a mass casualty incident in Timor-Leste, what challenges might you face when implementing the START triage method?
5. How can traditional Timorese healing practices be integrated into the emergency assessment process?
6. What are some potential barriers to effective communication during emergency assessments in Timor-Leste, and how can these be overcome?
7. How might limited resources in Timor-Leste affect decision-making during triage situations?
8. What role can community leaders play in supporting emergency assessments and triage in rural Timorese villages?
9. How can first responders in Timor-Leste improvise tools or equipment for conducting primary and secondary surveys?
10. What additional considerations should be taken into account when assessing scene safety during natural disasters common in Timor-Leste (e.g., floods, landslides)?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Scenario Analysis and Response Plan

1. Read the following scenario:
   "You are the first responder to arrive at a small village in rural Timor-Leste after a severe landslide. The village consists of about 20 traditional homes, and you can see that at least half of them have been damaged or destroyed. You hear calls for help coming from various locations, and you notice that the ground is still unstable in some areas."

2. Write a detailed response plan addressing the following points:
   a. Describe your initial scene safety assessment.
   b. Outline your approach to triage in this situation.
   c. Explain how you would conduct primary surveys given the limited resources available.
   d. Discuss any cultural or traditional considerations you would need to keep in mind.
   e. Describe how you would communicate and coordinate with villagers and any arriving help.

3. Your response should be approximately 500-750 words.

4. Use the concepts and techniques learned in class, adapting them to the specific context of rural Timor-Leste.

5. Consider the "Three P's" of first aid and how they apply to this scenario.

6. Include any improvisations or adaptations you would make given the limited resources likely available in this setting.

# Assignment Details

## Field Trip Report and Reflection

1. Participate in the field trip to a local health clinic or hospital emergency department.

2. During the visit, take detailed notes on:
   - The layout and organization of the emergency department
   - Equipment and resources available
   - Triage procedures observed
   - Any unique adaptations or techniques used in the Timorese context

3. After the field trip, write a report and reflection (1000-1200 words) addressing the following:
   a. Describe the emergency department's setup and resources.
   b. Compare and contrast the assessment and triage procedures observed with those learned in class.
   c. Identify any challenges or limitations faced by the emergency department.
   d. Discuss how traditional and modern medicine are integrated (if observed).
   e. Reflect on how the visit has informed your understanding of emergency response in Timor-Leste.

4. Include a brief interview summary with at least one staff member (nurse, doctor, or administrator) about their experiences with emergency assessment and triage.

5. Conclude with a personal reflection on how this experience will influence your approach to emergency assessment as a first responder in Timor-Leste.
