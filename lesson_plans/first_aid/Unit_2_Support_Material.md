Here's the support material for the lesson on Assessing Emergency Situations, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material: Assessing Emergency Situations

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Scene safety**: The process of identifying and mitigating potential hazards at an emergency site
- **Primary survey**: A quick assessment of a patient's vital functions (ABCDE)
- **Secondary survey**: A more detailed head-to-toe examination of a patient
- **Triage**: The process of sorting patients based on the urgency of their need for care
- **START method**: Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment, a system for quickly assessing patients in mass casualty incidents
- **The "Three P's"**: Preserve life, Prevent further injury, Promote recovery - the core principles of first aid
- **ABCDE**: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure - the components of a primary survey
- **Mass casualty incident**: An event that overwhelms the local healthcare system with a large number of patients

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Scene Safety Assessment Flowchart:
   - Step 1: Observe the scene from a distance
   - Step 2: Identify potential hazards (e.g., fire, unstable structures, aggressive individuals)
   - Step 3: Assess risk to self and others
   - Step 4: Determine if it's safe to approach
   - Step 5: If safe, proceed; if unsafe, call for appropriate assistance

2. Primary Survey (ABCDE) Diagram:
   - A circular diagram with "ABCDE" at the center
   - Surrounding the center: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure
   - Brief descriptions of each component around the outer edge

3. START Triage Method Visual:
   - A decision tree showing the triage process:
     * Can the person walk? → Minor (Green)
     * Is the person breathing? → No → Position airway → Still not breathing → Deceased (Black)
     * Is the person breathing? → Yes → Respiratory rate > 30? → Immediate (Red)
     * Respiratory rate < 30 → Capillary refill > 2 seconds or no radial pulse → Immediate (Red)
     * Capillary refill < 2 seconds and radial pulse present → Follows commands? → Yes → Delayed (Yellow), No → Immediate (Red)

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Emergency Scenario Assessment Worksheet:
   - Scenario description (e.g., car accident, natural disaster)
   - Questions to answer:
     * What potential hazards do you see?
     * Is it safe to approach? Why or why not?
     * What resources would you need to manage this scene?
     * Describe your initial actions upon arriving at this scene.

2. Primary and Secondary Survey Checklist:
   - Primary Survey:
     * [ ] Airway
     * [ ] Breathing
     * [ ] Circulation
     * [ ] Disability
     * [ ] Exposure
   - Secondary Survey:
     * [ ] Head
     * [ ] Neck
     * [ ] Chest
     * [ ] Abdomen
     * [ ] Pelvis
     * [ ] Extremities
     * [ ] Posterior

3. Triage Practice Scenarios:
   - Multiple brief patient descriptions
   - Students must categorize each patient using the START method
   - Space for students to justify their triage decisions

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. World Health Organization's "Basic Emergency Care" course materials
2. Red Cross First Aid/CPR/AED Participant's Manual
3. "Where There Is No Doctor" by David Werner (available in multiple languages)
4. Online triage simulation games or apps
5. Local emergency services protocols and guidelines for Timor-Leste

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language barriers:
   - Use visual aids extensively
   - Provide key terms in both Tetum and English
   - Encourage peer translation and explanation

2. Limited resources:
   - Focus on improvisation with locally available materials
   - Emphasize principles over specific equipment
   - Collaborate with local health facilities for practical demonstrations

3. Cultural sensitivities:
   - Discuss and respect local customs regarding physical contact and gender roles
   - Incorporate traditional healing concepts where appropriate
   - Invite local community leaders or traditional healers to contribute to the lesson

4. Varying literacy levels:
   - Use hands-on activities and role-play to reinforce concepts
   - Provide oral explanations alongside written materials
   - Encourage group work to support less confident students

5. Dealing with emotional responses:
   - Be prepared for students who may become overwhelmed by emergency scenarios
   - Have a plan for providing emotional support or referrals if needed
   - Emphasize the importance of self-care for first responders

6. Maintaining engagement:
   - Use a variety of teaching methods (lecture, discussion, hands-on practice)
   - Relate concepts to local experiences and scenarios
   - Encourage students to share their own experiences with emergencies

7. Assessing understanding:
   - Use frequent check-ins and informal assessments throughout the lesson
   - Provide opportunities for students to demonstrate skills practically
   - Encourage peer teaching to reinforce learning
