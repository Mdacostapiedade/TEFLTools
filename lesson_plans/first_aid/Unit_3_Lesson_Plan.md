# Lesson Plan: Basic Life Support and CPR

## Resources Needed
- CPR mannequins (adult, child, and infant)
- AED trainer
- First aid kits
- Disposable face shields or pocket masks
- Cleaning supplies for mannequins
- Projector and screen
- Handouts on CPR steps and AED use
- Timer or stopwatch
- Certificates of completion (optional)

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Demonstrate correct CPR techniques for adults, children, and infants
2. Explain and perform rescue breathing
3. Identify and respond to choking emergencies
4. Demonstrate proper use of an AED
5. Understand the importance of CPR and AED in the chain of survival

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Show a short video clip of a cardiac arrest scenario
- Facilitate a brief discussion on what students would do in that situation
- Introduce the concept of the "chain of survival" and how CPR fits into it

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)
Introduce and explain key terms:
- Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)
- Automated External Defibrillator (AED)
- Chest compressions
- Rescue breathing
- Cardiac arrest
- Heimlich maneuver

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Overview of CPR
   - When to perform CPR
   - The CAB approach (Compressions, Airway, Breathing)

2. Adult CPR technique
   - Proper hand placement
   - Compression depth and rate
   - Full chest recoil

3. Child and infant CPR differences
   - Hand placement adjustments
   - Compression depth modifications

4. Rescue breathing technique
   - Head-tilt chin-lift method
   - Mouth-to-mouth and mouth-to-nose methods
   - Use of barrier devices

5. Choking management
   - Recognition of choking
   - Abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver)
   - Back blows and chest thrusts for infants

6. AED use
   - When to use an AED
   - Step-by-step AED application
   - Safety considerations

## Practice Activities (60 minutes)
1. CPR practice stations
   - Divide class into small groups
   - Rotate through stations for adult, child, and infant CPR
   - Instructor provides feedback on technique

2. Rescue breathing practice
   - Pair students to practice on mannequins
   - Focus on proper seal and visible chest rise

3. Choking response role-play
   - Students practice recognizing and responding to choking scenarios

4. AED simulation
   - Walk through AED use on a mannequin
   - Practice pad placement and following AED prompts

## Production Tasks (30 minutes)
1. Full CPR and AED scenario
   - Students perform a complete CPR and AED sequence
   - Peers and instructor evaluate performance

2. Choking management demonstration
   - Students demonstrate proper technique for conscious and unconscious choking victims

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Recap key points of CPR, rescue breathing, choking management, and AED use
- Address any remaining questions or concerns
- Emphasize the importance of regular practice and refresher training

## Homework Assignment
1. Research and write a one-page summary on the current CPR guidelines in Timor-Leste
2. Create a simple infographic or poster on the steps of CPR to share with family members
3. Practice CPR hand placement and compression rhythm at home (without mannequin)

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR): An emergency procedure combining chest compressions and rescue breathing to maintain circulation and oxygenation during cardiac arrest.
- Automated External Defibrillator (AED): A portable device that checks heart rhythm and can send an electric shock to the heart to try to restore a normal rhythm.
- Chest compressions: Forceful pressing on the chest to pump blood through the body during CPR.
- Rescue breathing: The act of breathing air into a person's lungs to provide oxygen during CPR.
- Cardiac arrest: A sudden stop in effective blood circulation due to the failure of the heart to contract effectively.
- Heimlich maneuver: An emergency technique used to treat upper airway obstructions (or choking) by foreign objects.
