## Overview of CPR

### When to Perform CPR
- Perform CPR when a person is unresponsive and not breathing normally
- Check for responsiveness by tapping shoulders and shouting "Are you okay?"
- Look for chest rise and fall, listen for breath sounds, and feel for air from the nose or mouth
- If no signs of life, begin CPR immediately

### The CAB Approach
1. Compressions: Start chest compressions immediately
2. Airway: Open the airway using head-tilt chin-lift method
3. Breathing: Provide rescue breaths after 30 compressions

## Adult CPR Technique

### Proper Hand Placement
- Place the heel of one hand on the center of the chest
- Place the other hand on top and interlace fingers
- Keep arms straight and shoulders directly over hands

### Compression Depth and Rate
- Compress the chest at least 2 inches (5 cm) deep
- Perform compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute
- Use a steady rhythm, counting "1 and 2 and 3 and..."

### Full Chest Recoil
- Allow the chest to fully return to its normal position after each compression
- Avoid leaning on the chest between compressions

## Child and Infant CPR Differences

### Hand Placement Adjustments
- For children: Use one or two hands, depending on child's size
- For infants: Use two fingers on the center of the chest, just below the nipple line

### Compression Depth Modifications
- For children: Compress at least one-third the depth of the chest (about 2 inches)
- For infants: Compress at least one-third the depth of the chest (about 1.5 inches)

## Rescue Breathing Technique

### Head-tilt Chin-lift Method
1. Place one hand on the forehead and tilt the head back slightly
2. Use two fingers of the other hand to lift the chin
3. Maintain this position to keep the airway open

### Mouth-to-Mouth and Mouth-to-Nose Methods
- For mouth-to-mouth: Pinch the nose closed, create a seal over the mouth
- For mouth-to-nose: Close the mouth, create a seal over the nose
- Give two rescue breaths, each lasting about 1 second

### Use of Barrier Devices
- Use a face shield or pocket mask when available
- Ensure proper placement to create a tight seal
- Practice using barrier devices during training

## Choking Management

### Recognition of Choking
- Look for universal choking sign (hands clutching throat)
- Listen for inability to speak, cough, or breathe
- Observe for panic or distress

### Abdominal Thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver)
1. Stand behind the person and wrap your arms around their waist
2. Make a fist with one hand and place it above the navel
3. Grasp the fist with your other hand and give quick, upward thrusts
4. Repeat until the object is expelled or the person becomes unconscious

### Back Blows and Chest Thrusts for Infants
1. Support the infant face down on your forearm
2. Give five back blows between the shoulder blades
3. Turn the infant face up and give five chest thrusts
4. Repeat until the object is expelled or the infant becomes unconscious

## AED Use

### When to Use an AED
- Use an AED as soon as it's available for any unresponsive person not breathing normally
- Can be used on adults, children, and infants

### Step-by-Step AED Application
1. Turn on the AED and follow voice/visual prompts
2. Expose the person's chest and wipe it dry if necessary
3. Attach the AED pads to the bare chest as shown in the diagram
4. Ensure no one is touching the person while the AED analyzes the heart rhythm
5. If a shock is advised, ensure everyone is clear and press the shock button
6. Resume CPR immediately after the shock or if no shock is advised

### Safety Considerations
- Do not use an AED in water or if the person is lying on a metal surface
- Remove any medication patches or jewelry from the chest area
- For children under 8 or less than 55 pounds, use pediatric pads if available

# Discussion Questions

1. Why is immediate action crucial in a cardiac arrest situation?
2. How does the "chain of survival" concept apply to emergency response in Timor-Leste?
3. What cultural considerations might affect how CPR is performed or received in Timorese communities?
4. How can we address potential hesitations or fears about performing CPR in our local context?
5. What are some challenges in maintaining CPR skills, and how can we overcome them?
6. How might limited access to AEDs in Timor-Leste impact our approach to cardiac emergency response?
7. What role can community education play in improving cardiac arrest outcomes in Timor-Leste?
8. How can we integrate traditional Timorese healing practices with modern CPR techniques?
9. What are some potential improvised alternatives to standard CPR equipment in resource-limited settings?
10. How can we effectively teach CPR techniques to individuals with varying levels of literacy or formal education?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## CPR Scenario Analysis

1. Read the following scenario:
   "You are walking in a rural village in Timor-Leste when you see a middle-aged man suddenly collapse. There are several bystanders, but no one is taking action. You approach and find the man unresponsive and not breathing normally."

2. Write a detailed step-by-step response to this scenario, including:
   - Initial actions and assessment
   - CPR technique you would use
   - How you would involve bystanders
   - Considerations for the rural setting
   - Any cultural sensitivities you would be aware of

3. Your response should be 500-750 words and demonstrate your understanding of CPR techniques, emergency response, and the Timorese context.

4. After writing your response, reflect on any challenges or uncertainties you encountered while planning your actions. What additional information or skills would have been helpful?

# Assignment Details

## Community CPR Awareness Campaign

### Objective
Design a community CPR awareness campaign tailored for a specific district in Timor-Leste.

### Requirements
1. Choose a district in Timor-Leste and research its demographic and health characteristics.
2. Develop a campaign strategy that includes:
   - Key messages about CPR and its importance
   - Target audience(s)
   - Communication channels (e.g., radio, community meetings, posters)
   - Culturally appropriate presentation of information
   - Hands-on demonstration component
3. Create at least two campaign materials (e.g., poster, radio script, brochure)
4. Write a 2-page implementation plan outlining how you would execute the campaign
5. Include a brief section on how you would measure the campaign's effectiveness

### Submission
- Submit a campaign portfolio including all materials and the implementation plan
- Be prepared to present your campaign to the class in a 10-minute presentation

### Evaluation Criteria
- Relevance to the chosen district's context
- Clarity and effectiveness of key messages
- Creativity and cultural appropriateness of campaign materials
- Feasibility of implementation plan
- Consideration of potential challenges and solutions

## CPR Fact Sheet for Timor-Leste

### Key Statistics
- Cardiovascular diseases account for X% of deaths in Timor-Leste (insert current statistic)
- Only Y% of the population is trained in CPR (insert current statistic if available)
- Access to emergency medical services varies widely between urban and rural areas

### CPR Basics in Tetum
- Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation = Reanimação Cardiopulmonar
- Chest Compressions = Kompresaun Peitu
- Rescue Breathing = Fó Iis
- Automated External Defibrillator = Desfibrilador Automátiku Externu

### Local Emergency Numbers
- National Emergency Number: 112
- Ambulance Service: 110
- Fire Department: 115
- Police: 112

### Cultural Considerations
- Respect for elders may affect willingness to perform CPR on older individuals
- Gender considerations may impact who can perform CPR on whom
- Traditional healing practices may be preferred in some communities

## AED Locations in Dili (Example)
- Hospital Nacional Guido Valadares

Note: Verify and update this list with current information

## Improvised CPR Tools
- Folded cloth or small bag can replace barrier device for rescue breathing
- Hard, flat surface (e.g., wooden board) can be used under patient on soft ground
- Mobile phone timer can help maintain proper compression rate
