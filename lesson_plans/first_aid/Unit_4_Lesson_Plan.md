# Lesson Plan: Wound Care and Bleeding Control

## Resources Needed
- First aid manual
- Basic first aid kit
- Bandages, gauze, and other wound dressing materials
- Fake blood and makeup for simulating wounds
- Tourniquets or materials to improvise tourniquets
- Antiseptic solutions
- Gloves
- Flipchart or whiteboard
- Markers

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify different types of wounds common in Timor-Leste
2. Demonstrate proper wound cleaning and dressing techniques
3. Apply pressure to control bleeding using appropriate pressure points
4. Correctly use a tourniquet in severe bleeding situations
5. Explain infection prevention measures in wound care

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Show images of different types of wounds and ask students to identify them
- Discuss any personal experiences with treating wounds or controlling bleeding

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)
Introduce and explain key terms:
- Abrasion
- Laceration
- Puncture wound
- Avulsion
- Hemorrhage
- Tourniquet
- Pressure point
- Antiseptic

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Types of wounds common in Timor-Leste
   - Discuss characteristics and causes of each wound type
2. Wound cleaning and dressing
   - Demonstrate proper cleaning techniques
   - Show various dressing methods for different wound types
3. Bleeding control techniques
   - Explain and demonstrate direct pressure
   - Identify major pressure points and their use
   - Discuss tourniquet use and precautions
4. Infection prevention in wound care
   - Explain importance of clean technique
   - Discuss signs of infection and when to seek medical help

## Practice Activities (40 minutes)
1. Wound identification exercise
   - Students work in pairs to identify wound types from a set of images
2. Wound cleaning and dressing practice
   - Students practice cleaning and dressing simulated wounds on each other
3. Pressure point location
   - Students locate and practice applying pressure to major pressure points

## Production Tasks (30 minutes)
1. Bleeding control scenario
   - In small groups, students respond to a simulated severe bleeding emergency
   - Groups demonstrate proper use of direct pressure, pressure points, and tourniquets
2. Wound care decision-making
   - Present case studies of various wound scenarios
   - Students discuss and decide on appropriate treatment plans

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Conduct a quick quiz on key points covered in the lesson
- Address any remaining questions or concerns
- Summarize main takeaways from the lesson

## Homework Assignment
1. Research traditional Timorese methods for wound care and bleeding control
2. Create an infographic on wound care and infection prevention for community education
3. Practice bandaging techniques on family members and document with photos
