## Types of Wounds Common in Timor-Leste

### Abrasions
- Definition: Superficial wounds caused by scraping or rubbing of the skin
- Common causes in Timor-Leste:
  * Motorcycle accidents on unpaved roads
  * Falls while hiking or working in agricultural areas
  * Injuries from manual labor

### Lacerations
- Definition: Deep cuts or tears in the skin
- Common causes in Timor-Leste:
  * Accidents with machetes or other farming tools
  * Injuries from broken glass or metal in urban areas
  * Animal-related injuries (e.g., from livestock)

### Puncture Wounds
- Definition: Small holes caused by sharp, pointed objects
- Common causes in Timor-Leste:
  * Stepping on nails or other debris in construction areas
  * Injuries from fish hooks or spines while fishing
  * Bites from dogs or other animals

### Avulsions
- Definition: Wounds where skin or tissue is partially or completely torn away
- Common causes in Timor-Leste:
  * Severe road accidents
  * Industrial accidents in developing urban areas
  * Animal attacks (e.g., from feral dogs)

## Wound Cleaning and Dressing

### Cleaning Techniques
1. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water
2. Put on clean gloves
3. Irrigate the wound with clean water or saline solution
4. Clean around the wound with antiseptic solution, moving from the center outward
5. Remove any visible debris with sterile tweezers
6. Pat the wound dry with sterile gauze

### Dressing Methods
- For abrasions:
  * Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment
  * Cover with a non-stick gauze pad
  * Secure with medical tape or a bandage

- For lacerations:
  * Close small cuts with butterfly bandages or steri-strips
  * For larger cuts, seek medical attention for possible suturing
  * Cover with a sterile gauze pad and secure with a bandage

- For puncture wounds:
  * Do not attempt to remove deeply embedded objects
  * Clean the area around the puncture site
  * Apply an antibiotic ointment and cover with a sterile dressing

- For avulsions:
  * Gently clean the wound and surrounding area
  * If possible, carefully replace the avulsed tissue
  * Cover with a moist, sterile dressing
  * Seek immediate medical attention

## Bleeding Control Techniques

### Direct Pressure
- Apply firm, steady pressure directly to the wound using a clean cloth or sterile gauze
- Maintain pressure for at least 15 minutes without lifting the dressing
- If blood soaks through, add more layers without removing the original dressing

### Pressure Points
- Brachial artery (for arm bleeding): Inner part of the upper arm
- Femoral artery (for leg bleeding): Groin area where the leg meets the body
- Temporal artery (for scalp bleeding): Temple, in front of the ear

### Tourniquet Use
- Only for life-threatening limb hemorrhages when other methods fail
- Apply 2-3 inches above the wound, not on a joint
- Use a wide, flat material (e.g., a belt or torn cloth)
- Tighten until bleeding stops
- Note the time of application
- Do not remove once applied; wait for medical professionals

## Infection Prevention in Wound Care

### Clean Technique
- Wash hands before and after wound care
- Use sterile or clean supplies
- Clean from the center of the wound outward
- Avoid touching the wound directly

### Signs of Infection
- Increased pain, redness, or swelling
- Warmth around the wound
- Pus or foul-smelling discharge
- Fever
- Red streaks extending from the wound

### When to Seek Medical Help
- Deep or gaping wounds
- Wounds that won't stop bleeding
- Signs of infection
- Animal or human bites
- Wounds contaminated with dirt or debris
- Puncture wounds, especially on the foot

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Wound Care Case Study Analysis

1. Read the following case study:

   Maria, a 45-year-old farmer in a remote village of Timor-Leste, accidentally cuts her leg with a machete while working in her field. The cut is deep and bleeding heavily. The nearest health clinic is a 3-hour walk away, and there is no transportation available. You are the only trained first aider in the village.

2. Write a detailed response (500-750 words) addressing the following points:
   - Describe the immediate steps you would take to assess and treat Maria's wound.
   - Explain how you would control the bleeding using available resources.
   - Discuss potential challenges you might face in this situation and how you would overcome them.
   - Outline a plan for ongoing care and monitoring of the wound, considering the limited access to medical facilities.
   - Reflect on how this situation highlights the importance of first aid training in remote communities.

3. Include specific references to the wound care and bleeding control techniques discussed in class.

4. Consider cultural and environmental factors that might influence your approach to treatment and patient care.

5. Conclude with recommendations for improving emergency response capabilities in remote areas of Timor-Leste.
