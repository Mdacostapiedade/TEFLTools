# Lesson Plan: Environmental Emergencies and Illnesses in Timor-Leste

## Resources Needed

- First aid manual (in Tetum and English)
- Basic first aid kit
- Snake bite simulation kit
- Heat exhaustion/stroke simulation materials
- Posters or handouts on malaria and dengue fever symptoms
- Local plant guide for traditional remedies
- Projector and computer for presentations (if available)

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke
2. Demonstrate proper first aid for drowning victims
3. Perform correct first aid procedures for snake and insect bites
4. Recognize symptoms of common tropical diseases like malaria and dengue fever
5. Apply basic treatment techniques for environmental emergencies using both modern and traditional methods

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Show images of various environmental emergencies and have students identify them
- Brief discussion on personal experiences with environmental hazards in Timor-Leste

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Heat exhaustion
- Heat stroke
- Hyperthermia
- Hypothermia
- Envenomation
- Vector-borne diseases

## Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### 1. Heat-related Illnesses (15 minutes)
- Explain differences between heat exhaustion and heat stroke
- Discuss risk factors in Timor-Leste's climate
- Demonstrate first aid techniques for each condition

### 2. Drowning and Water Safety (10 minutes)
- Discuss water-related risks in Timor-Leste
- Explain the drowning process and rescue priorities
- Demonstrate rescue breathing and CPR for drowning victims

### 3. Snake and Insect Bites (15 minutes)
- Identify common venomous snakes and insects in Timor-Leste
- Explain first aid procedures for bites and stings
- Discuss traditional remedies and their efficacy

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Heat illness simulation: Students practice assessing and treating a simulated heat stroke victim
2. Snake bite scenario: Students demonstrate proper first aid for a simulated snake bite
3. Group discussion: Identify local water hazards and develop safety strategies

## Production Tasks (20 minutes)

1. Create a public awareness poster on preventing heat-related illnesses
2. Develop a simple mnemonic device in Tetum for remembering snake bite first aid steps

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick recap of key points for each topic covered
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions or concerns

## Homework Assignment

1. Research one traditional Timorese remedy for treating insect bites or heat-related illnesses
2. Create a simple first aid guide for a common environmental emergency, using both text and illustrations

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Heat exhaustion: A condition resulting from excessive heat exposure, characterized by heavy sweating, rapid pulse, and fatigue
- Heat stroke: A severe and potentially life-threatening condition caused by overheating, marked by high body temperature, altered mental state, and often a lack of sweating
- Hyperthermia: Abnormally high body temperature
- Hypothermia: Abnormally low body temperature
- Envenomation: The process by which venom is injected into a person or animal by bite or sting
- Vector-borne diseases: Illnesses caused by parasites, viruses, or bacteria that are transmitted by vectors, such as mosquitoes or ticks
