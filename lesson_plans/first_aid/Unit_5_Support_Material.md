## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Heat exhaustion: A condition resulting from excessive heat exposure, characterized by heavy sweating, rapid pulse, and fatigue
- Heat stroke: A severe and potentially life-threatening condition caused by overheating, marked by high body temperature, altered mental state, and often a lack of sweating
- Hyperthermia: Abnormally high body temperature
- Hypothermia: Abnormally low body temperature
- Envenomation: The process by which venom is injected into a person or animal by bite or sting
- Vector-borne diseases: Illnesses caused by parasites, viruses, or bacteria that are transmitted by vectors, such as mosquitoes or ticks
- Malaria: A mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite, characterized by fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms
- Dengue fever: A mosquito-borne viral infection causing severe flu-like symptoms and sometimes life-threatening complications
- CPR: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, an emergency procedure combining chest compressions and artificial ventilation
- Dehydration: A condition where the body loses more fluids than it takes in, leading to an insufficient amount of water and other fluids to carry out normal functions

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barriers:
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of proficiency in Tetum and English.
   - Solution: Use visual aids extensively and encourage peer translation. Provide key terms in both languages.

2. Limited Resources:
   - Challenge: Lack of modern first aid equipment for demonstrations.
   - Solution: Focus on improvisation techniques using locally available materials. Emphasize the importance of resourcefulness in emergency situations.

3. Cultural Sensitivity:
   - Challenge: Balancing traditional beliefs with modern medical practices.
   - Solution: Acknowledge the value of traditional methods while explaining the scientific basis for modern techniques. Encourage open discussion about integrating both approaches.

4. Practical Experience:
   - Challenge: Providing realistic emergency scenarios for practice.
   - Solution: Use role-playing extensively. Collaborate with local health clinics or emergency services for field trips or guest speakers.

5. Misconceptions about First Aid:
   - Challenge: Addressing common myths or incorrect practices.
   - Solution: Begin each topic by asking students about their current knowledge or practices. Gently correct misconceptions with evidence-based information.

6. Engagement with Serious Topics:
   - Challenge: Maintaining student interest in potentially distressing subject matter.
   - Solution: Use interactive activities, group discussions, and real-life case studies to keep the content relatable and engaging.

7. Varying Literacy Levels:
   - Challenge: Accommodating students with different reading abilities.
   - Solution: Provide information in multiple formats (verbal, visual, hands-on). Use simple language and encourage peer support.
