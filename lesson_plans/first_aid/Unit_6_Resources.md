# Lecture Notes

## Common Disasters in Timor-Leste

### Floods
- Most frequent natural disaster in Timor-Leste
- Often caused by heavy rainfall during monsoon season (November to April)
- Exacerbated by deforestation and poor drainage infrastructure
- Major flood events: 2021 Easter floods, 2020 Dili floods

### Landslides
- Second most common disaster after floods
- Triggered by heavy rainfall and unstable soil conditions
- Often occur in conjunction with floods
- Particularly dangerous in mountainous regions and areas with steep slopes

### Earthquakes
- Timor-Leste located in seismically active region
- Risk of tsunamis due to offshore fault lines
- Notable event: 2019 magnitude 6.3 earthquake off the coast of Timor-Leste

### Droughts
- Periodic occurrence, especially during El Ni√±o years
- Impacts agriculture and food security
- Can lead to water scarcity and health issues

### Climate Change Impact
- Increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events
- Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities
- Changes in rainfall patterns affecting agriculture and water resources

## Community Evacuation Procedures

### Elements of an Effective Evacuation Plan
1. Clear chain of command and decision-making process
2. Multiple evacuation routes identified and marked
3. Designated safe assembly points
4. Special provisions for vulnerable populations (elderly, disabled, children)
5. Transportation arrangements for those without personal vehicles
6. Emergency supply stockpiles at key locations

### Identifying Safe Routes and Assembly Points
- Conduct community mapping exercises
- Consider elevation, distance from hazard zones, and accessibility
- Ensure routes can accommodate expected population flow
- Assembly points should be large, open areas away from potential hazards

### Communication Strategies During Evacuations
- Establish multi-channel alert system (sirens, radio, SMS, social media)
- Use clear, simple language in local dialects
- Designate community leaders as information points
- Implement buddy system to ensure no one is left behind

## Basic Search and Rescue Techniques

### Safety Considerations for Rescuers
- Personal protective equipment (PPE) usage
- Risk assessment before entering hazardous areas
- Working in teams of at least two
- Regular check-ins with command center

### Simple Search Patterns
1. Grid search: Systematic coverage of an area in parallel lines
2. Spiral search: Start from center and move outward in a spiral pattern
3. Line search: Team members form a line and move forward together

### Victim Extraction Techniques
- Single-person carries: Fireman's carry, pack-strap carry
- Two-person carries: Chair carry, fore-and-aft carry
- Improvised stretchers using local materials
- Basic rope rescue techniques for steep terrain

## Psychological First Aid

### Principles of Psychological First Aid
1. Promote safety
2. Promote calm
3. Promote connectedness
4. Promote self-efficacy
5. Promote hope

### Identifying Signs of Trauma and Stress
- Physical symptoms: Fatigue, headaches, changes in appetite
- Emotional symptoms: Anxiety, depression, anger, mood swings
- Cognitive symptoms: Confusion, difficulty concentrating, memory problems
- Behavioral symptoms: Withdrawal, aggression, substance abuse

### Techniques for Providing Emotional Support
- Active listening without judgment
- Validating feelings and experiences
- Helping to identify and prioritize immediate needs
- Providing accurate information and dispelling rumors
- Connecting individuals with support networks and resources

# Discussion Questions

1. How has climate change affected disaster risks in Timor-Leste, and what can communities do to adapt?
2. What are the unique challenges of implementing evacuation plans in rural vs. urban areas of Timor-Leste?
3. How can traditional knowledge and practices be integrated into modern disaster preparedness strategies?
4. What role do community leaders and traditional healers play in providing psychological first aid after a disaster?
5. How can Timor-Leste improve its early warning systems for different types of disasters?
6. What are the ethical considerations in triage and resource allocation during a large-scale disaster response?
7. How can disaster preparedness education be effectively incorporated into school curricula in Timor-Leste?
8. What are the potential long-term psychological impacts of recurring disasters on communities, and how can these be mitigated?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

3. Include the following elements:
   - Geographic and environmental factors that contribute to risk
   - Socio-economic factors that affect vulnerability
   - Existing infrastructure and its capacity to withstand disasters
   - Current level of community preparedness and awareness
4. Conclude with three specific recommendations to reduce the community's vulnerability.
