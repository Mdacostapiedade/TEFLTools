# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "The Living History of Timor-Leste" by Geoffrey C. Gunn

"The island of Timor has been inhabited for at least 40,000 years, with early settlers bringing with them agricultural practices that would shape the island's food culture for millennia. The Austronesian expansion, beginning around 2000 BCE, introduced new crops and farming techniques, including wet rice cultivation.

Portuguese colonization, starting in the 16th century, brought significant changes to Timorese foodways. The introduction of maize, cassava, and sweet potatoes from the Americas diversified the local diet and agricultural practices. These crops, particularly maize, became staples in many parts of Timor-Leste.

The Indonesian occupation (1975-1999) further altered the food landscape. Policies promoting rice cultivation and the resettlement of populations disrupted traditional farming systems and food distribution networks. The conflict also led to widespread food insecurity and malnutrition.

In the post-independence era, Timor-Leste has been working to rebuild its food systems, balancing traditional practices with modern agricultural techniques. The country faces ongoing challenges in achieving food security and preserving its rich culinary heritage."

# Lecture Notes

## Historical Overview of Timor-Leste

1. Geography:
   - Located in Southeast Asia, north of Australia
   - Eastern half of Timor island, plus Oecusse enclave in West Timor
   - Mountainous terrain with tropical climate

   - Austronesian expansion (c. 2000 BCE) brought new agricultural practices
   - Traditional kingdoms and tribal structures

3. Colonial period:
   - Portuguese arrival in 16th century
   - Dutch competition in West Timor
   - Portuguese control solidified in 19th century

4. 20th century:
   - Japanese occupation during World War II

   - Importance of certain foods (e.g., buffalo meat) in ceremonies

## Influence of Colonialism and Conflict on Food Systems

1. Portuguese influences:
   - Introduction of New World crops (maize, cassava, sweet potatoes)
   - Coffee cultivation as cash crop
   - Integration of some Portuguese dishes (e.g., caldo)

2. Indonesian occupation impacts:
   - Disruption of traditional farming systems
   - Forced relocation of populations
   - Introduction of new foods (e.g., instant noodles, tempeh)
   - Rice cultivation promotion

3. Conflict-related food issues:
   - Destruction of agricultural infrastructure
   - Food used as a weapon (forced starvation)
   - Disruption of trade and market systems

4. Post-independence challenges:
   - Rebuilding agricultural systems
   - Balancing traditional and modern practices
   - Addressing malnutrition and food insecurity

# Discussion Questions

1. How has Timor-Leste's geography influenced its food culture and agricultural practices?
2. In what ways did Portuguese colonization alter Timorese foodways? Were these changes primarily positive or negative?
3. How did the Indonesian occupation impact food security and traditional farming practices in Timor-Leste?
4. What role does wild food foraging play in Timorese food culture, and how has this practice been affected by historical events?
5. How do you think Timor-Leste can balance preserving traditional food culture with addressing modern nutritional needs?
6. What similarities and differences do you see between Timorese food history and the food history of your own culture or region?
7. How might climate change affect Timor-Leste's food systems in the future, given its geographical location and agricultural practices?
