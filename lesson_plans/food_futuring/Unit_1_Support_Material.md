## 5. Tips for Teachers

1. **Language Barrier**: Some students may struggle with Tetum or Portuguese terms. Provide a glossary of key terms with phonetic pronunciations.

2. **Limited Prior Knowledge**: Many students may be unfamiliar with Timor-Leste. Start with basic geography and historical context before diving into food systems.

3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: When discussing the impacts of colonialism and conflict, be mindful of potential emotional responses from students with personal connections to similar histories.

4. **Lack of Firsthand Experience**: If possible, invite guest speakers from Timor-Leste or incorporate virtual tours to provide more immersive learning experiences.

5. **Connecting to Personal Experiences**: Encourage students to draw parallels between Timorese food culture and their own to increase engagement and understanding.

6. **Hands-on Learning**: If possible, incorporate tastings of Timorese ingredients or dishes to enhance sensory learning and engagement.

7. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: Highlight connections between food systems and other disciplines like economics, environmental science, and political science to broaden student perspectives.
