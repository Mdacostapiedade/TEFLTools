# Lesson Plan: Food Security and Nutrition Challenges in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts with food security statistics for Timor-Leste
- Flip charts and markers for group work
- Case study materials on a Timorese community facing food insecurity
- Guest speaker (local nutritionist or public health expert)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define food security and its key components
- Analyze current food security indicators in Timor-Leste
- Identify major nutrition challenges facing Timorese communities
- Explain factors contributing to food insecurity in Timor-Leste
- Apply knowledge to a real-world case study of food insecurity

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Students reflect on their own experiences with food insecurity or nutritional challenges, then share with a partner, and finally with the class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms: food security, malnutrition, stunting, wasting, micronutrient deficiency, food sovereignty
- Students create a vocabulary map linking these terms

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

- Lecture on food security indicators in Timor-Leste, covering:
  * Current statistics on malnutrition and food insecurity
  * Comparison with regional and global averages
  * Trends over the past decade
- Discussion of major nutrition challenges:
  * Stunting and wasting in children
  * Micronutrient deficiencies (e.g., iron, vitamin A)
  * Double burden of malnutrition (undernutrition and obesity)
- Factors contributing to food insecurity:
  * Environmental challenges (climate change, soil degradation)
  * Economic factors (poverty, limited market access)
  * Social and cultural factors (gender inequality, food taboos)
  * Political factors (post-conflict recovery, policy implementation)

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Small group analysis of food security data:
  * Groups are given different datasets on food security indicators
  * They must interpret the data and present findings to the class

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

- Case study analysis:
  * Students are divided into groups and given a case study of a Timorese community facing food insecurity
  * They must identify key issues, analyze contributing factors, and propose potential solutions
  * Groups present their findings to the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion on key takeaways from the lesson
- Quick quiz on main concepts covered

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students write a 2-page reflection paper on the most pressing food security challenge in Timor-Leste and propose an innovative solution

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Food security: When all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.
- Malnutrition: Poor nutrition caused by insufficient, excessive, or imbalanced intake of nutrients.
- Stunting: Impaired growth and development in children due to poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation.
- Wasting: Low weight for height, generally the result of acute significant food shortage and/or disease.
- Micronutrient deficiency: Lack of essential vitamins and minerals required in small amounts by the body for proper growth and development.
- Food sovereignty: The right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems.
