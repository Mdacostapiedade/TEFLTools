## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited prior knowledge of Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Provide a brief country overview at the beginning of the lesson and incorporate geographical and historical context throughout.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in relating to food insecurity issues if students haven't experienced them.
   **Solution**: Use the warm-up activity to build empathy and encourage students to think about food access in their own communities.

3. **Challenge**: Interpreting complex food security data.
   **Solution**: Provide clear guidelines for data interpretation and consider pairing stronger students with those who may need more support during group work.

4. **Challenge**: Maintaining engagement during the lecture portion.
   **Solution**: Incorporate interactive elements such as quick polls or brief discussions to break up the lecture and keep students engaged.

5. **Challenge**: Time management, especially during group activities.
   **Solution**: Set clear time limits for each part of group activities and use a visible timer. Have additional questions or tasks prepared for groups that finish early.

6. **Challenge**: Ensuring respectful discussion of sensitive topics related to poverty and malnutrition.
   **Solution**: Establish ground rules for respectful dialogue at the beginning of the lesson and model sensitive language when discussing these issues.
