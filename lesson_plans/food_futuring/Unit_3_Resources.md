1. Community leaders gather at a sacred site, often near a forest or water source.
2. A traditional elder recites prayers and invokes ancestral spirits.
3. A sacrificial animal (often a pig or chicken) is offered.
4. Leaders declare certain areas off-limits for harvesting or hunting for a specified period.
5. Symbolic items representing the protected resources are tied to a ceremonial pole.
6. Community members share a meal, often including the sacrificial animal and locally grown foods.
7. The ceremony concludes with traditional music and dance.

This practice helps maintain biodiversity, allows resources to regenerate, and reinforces community bonds through shared responsibility and celebration.
