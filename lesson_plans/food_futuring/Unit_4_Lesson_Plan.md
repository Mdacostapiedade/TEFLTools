# Lesson Plan: Sustainable Agriculture and Food Production in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on sustainable farming techniques
- Materials for farm model creation (cardboard, markers, craft supplies)
- Guest speaker (local farmer or agricultural expert)
- Transportation for field visit

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify traditional and modern farming techniques used in Timor-Leste
- Analyze challenges facing Timorese farmers
- Evaluate sustainable agriculture initiatives and their impact
- Design a sustainable farming plan for a Timorese community

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Students reflect on what they know about farming in Timor-Leste, share with a partner, then discuss as a class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  * Slash-and-burn agriculture
  * Crop rotation
  * Agroforestry
  * Permaculture
  * Soil erosion
  * Water management

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

- Lecture and discussion on:
  * Traditional farming methods in Timor-Leste
  * Modern agricultural practices introduced post-independence
  * Challenges facing Timorese farmers (climate change, soil degradation, water scarcity)
  * Overview of sustainable agriculture initiatives in Timor-Leste

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Small group activity: Analyze case studies of different farms in Timor-Leste, identifying challenges and potential sustainable solutions.

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Field visit to a local farm or agricultural project
  * Students observe and document farming practices
  * Q&A session with farmers or project leaders

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (20 minutes)

- Class discussion on observations from the field visit
- Quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Design a sustainable farming plan for a hypothetical Timorese community, considering local climate, resources, and cultural factors. Include a visual representation (map or model) and a written explanation of proposed techniques.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Slash-and-burn agriculture: A farming method where vegetation is cut down and burned to clear land for cultivation.
- Crop rotation: The practice of growing different types of crops in the same area across seasons to improve soil health and reduce pests.
- Agroforestry: A land use management system where trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland.
- Permaculture: A system of agricultural and social design principles centered on simulating or directly utilizing patterns and features observed in natural ecosystems.
- Soil erosion: The wearing away of topsoil by natural forces like water or wind, often accelerated by human activities.
- Water management: The control and movement of water resources to minimize damage to life and property and to maximize efficient use.
