## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barrier**: 
   - Challenge: Some students may struggle with technical terms in English.
   - Solution: Provide a glossary with translations in Tetum or Portuguese. Use visual aids to reinforce concepts.

2. **Limited Prior Knowledge**: 
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of familiarity with agricultural concepts.
   - Solution: Begin with a baseline assessment and adjust content accordingly. Use the warm-up activity to gauge understanding.

3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: 
   - Challenge: Some traditional practices may conflict with sustainable methods.
   - Solution: Approach the topic with respect, emphasizing the integration of traditional knowledge with new techniques.

4. **Limited Resources for Field Trips**: 
   - Challenge: Organizing visits to farms may be logistically difficult.
   - Solution: Consider virtual farm tours or inviting local farmers to the classroom as guest speakers.

5. **Engaging Students with Diverse Interests**: 
   - Challenge: Not all students may be interested in agriculture.
   - Solution: Highlight connections between agriculture and other fields like economics, environmental science, and cultural studies.

6. **Practical Application Limitations**: 
   - Challenge: Students may not have opportunities to apply learned techniques.
   - Solution: Incorporate hands-on activities like creating small container gardens or participating in community gardening projects.
