# Lesson Plan: Participatory Research Methods in Food Systems

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts on participatory research techniques
- Flip charts and colored markers for group work
- Sample community interview questions
- Ethical guidelines for community-based research

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define participatory research and its key principles
- Identify and describe at least three participatory rural appraisal techniques
- Understand ethical considerations in community-based research
- Conduct a basic community interview using appropriate techniques
- Design a simple participatory research project on a local food issue

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Students reflect on a time they were asked for their opinion or input on an issue that affected them. How did it make them feel? What was the outcome?
- Class discussion on the importance of community involvement in research and decision-making

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Participatory research
- Community-based research
- Participatory rural appraisal (PRA)
- Stakeholder
- Empowerment
- Triangulation

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Introduction to participatory research principles
- Overview of participatory rural appraisal techniques:
  * Transect walks
  * Seasonal calendars
  * Venn diagrams
  * Problem trees
  * Focus group discussions
- Ethical considerations in community-based research:
  * Informed consent
  * Confidentiality
  * Cultural sensitivity
  * Power dynamics
- Data collection and analysis in participatory research

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Small group activity: Each group is assigned a PRA technique to research further and present to the class (15 minutes preparation, 15 minutes presentations)
2. Pair work: Students practice conducting community interviews using provided sample questions (10 minutes)

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

Role-play exercise:
- Divide class into "researchers" and "community members"
- Researchers conduct mock interviews and PRA activities with community members
- Switch roles and repeat
- Debrief as a class, discussing challenges and insights

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Class discussion: How can participatory research methods be applied to food system issues in Timor-Leste?

## 9. Homework Assignment

Design a participatory research project proposal on a local food issue in Timor-Leste. The proposal should include:
- Research question
- Justification for using participatory methods
- Description of at least two PRA techniques to be used
- Ethical considerations
- Plan for data analysis and community feedback

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Participatory research: A collaborative approach to research that involves community members as active participants in the research process
- Community-based research: Research conducted in partnership with community members to address issues of concern to the community
- Participatory rural appraisal (PRA): A set of techniques for gathering and analyzing information with the active involvement of community members
- Stakeholder: An individual or group with an interest in or affected by a particular issue or project
