## Introduction to Participatory Research Principles

- Participatory research is a collaborative approach that involves community members as active participants in the research process
- Key principles:
  * Research is conducted with and by local people, not on them
  * Local knowledge is valued and incorporated
  * The process is empowering and capacity-building
  * Research aims to lead to action and positive change
- Benefits:
  * More relevant and accurate data
  * Increased community ownership and buy-in
  * Enhanced capacity for problem-solving
  * Potential for sustainable change

## Participatory Rural Appraisal Techniques

### Transect Walks
- Systematic walk through an area with local guides to observe and discuss various aspects of the environment and community life
- Used to gather spatial information on resources, land use, and community perceptions

### Seasonal Calendars
- Visual tool to explore seasonal variations in activities, resources, and challenges
- Helps understand cyclical patterns in food production, labor, health issues, etc.

### Venn Diagrams
- Used to visualize relationships between different groups or institutions in a community
- Helps understand power dynamics and decision-making processes

### Problem Trees
- Visual representation of a problem, its causes, and effects
- Useful for analyzing complex issues and identifying potential intervention points

### Focus Group Discussions
- Facilitated discussions with small groups of community members
- Allows for in-depth exploration of specific topics and gathering of diverse perspectives

## Ethical Considerations in Community-Based Research

- Informed consent: Ensuring participants understand the research purpose and their rights
- Confidentiality: Protecting participants' privacy and personal information
- Cultural sensitivity: Respecting local customs, beliefs, and practices
- Power dynamics: Being aware of and mitigating power imbalances between researchers and participants
- Reciprocity: Ensuring research benefits the community and sharing results

## Data Collection and Analysis in Participatory Research

- Mixed methods approach: Combining qualitative and quantitative data
- Participatory data analysis: Involving community members in interpreting findings
- Triangulation: Using multiple sources and methods to verify information
- Iterative process: Continuously refining research questions and methods based on community feedback
- Importance of reflexivity: Researchers critically examining their own biases and assumptions

# Discussion Questions

1. How might participatory research methods be particularly useful in understanding food systems in Timor-Leste?
2. What challenges might researchers face when implementing participatory methods in Timorese communities? How could these challenges be addressed?
3. How can we ensure that participatory research truly empowers communities rather than simply extracting information?
4. In what ways might traditional Timorese decision-making processes inform or conflict with participatory research approaches?
5. How can participatory research methods be used to bridge traditional knowledge and scientific approaches in addressing food system challenges?
6. What ethical considerations are particularly important when conducting food-related research in Timor-Leste?
7. How might participatory research methods need to be adapted for different contexts within Timor-Leste (e.g., urban vs. rural areas)?
8. In what ways could participatory research contribute to sustainable development goals related to food security in Timor-Leste?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Journal Entry

Write a 500-word reflective journal entry on the potential impact of participatory research methods on food system development in Timor-Leste. Consider the following questions:

1. How might participatory methods change the way food system challenges are understood and addressed?
2. What potential benefits and drawbacks do you see in using these methods in Timorese communities?
3. How do participatory approaches align with or challenge your previous understanding of research and development work?
4. Reflect on how you might apply participatory methods in your future work or studies related to food systems.

# Additional Materials

## Sample Community Interview Questions

1. Can you tell me about the main foods that are important in your community?
2. How has food production or availability changed in recent years?
3. What are the biggest challenges your community faces in terms of food?
4. Who makes decisions about food production and distribution in your community?
5. Are there any traditional food practices that are being lost? Why?
6. What would you like to see change about the food system in your community?
7. How do you think climate change is affecting food production here?
8. What role do women play in food production and preparation in your community?
9. Are there any local innovations or success stories related to food that you can share?
10. How do you think young people view traditional foods compared to older generations?

## Ethical Guidelines for Community-Based Research in Timor-Leste
