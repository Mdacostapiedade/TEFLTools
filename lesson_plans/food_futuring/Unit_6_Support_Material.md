# Support Material for Participatory Research Methods in Food Systems

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Participatory research**: A collaborative approach to research that involves community members as active participants in the research process.
- **Community-based research**: Research conducted in partnership with community members to address issues of concern to the community.
- **Participatory rural appraisal (PRA)**: A set of techniques for gathering and analyzing information with the active involvement of community members.
- **Stakeholder**: An individual or group with an interest in or affected by a particular issue or project.
- **Empowerment**: The process of increasing the capacity of individuals or groups to make choices and transform those choices into desired actions and outcomes.
- **Triangulation**: The use of multiple methods or data sources to develop a comprehensive understanding of phenomena.
- **Transect walk**: A systematic walk through a community to observe, discuss, and record the various features, resources, and conditions.
- **Seasonal calendar**: A visual tool used to explore seasonal variations in activities, resources, and challenges within a community.
- **Venn diagram**: A visual representation of relationships between different groups or institutions in a community.
- **Problem tree**: A visual tool that helps identify the causes and effects of a central problem.
- **Focus group discussion**: A qualitative research method involving a guided discussion with a small group of participants.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Participatory Research Cycle Diagram**
   Description: A circular diagram showing the stages of participatory research:

   - Venn Diagram (overlapping circles)
   - Problem Tree (tree with roots labeled "causes" and branches labeled "effects")
   - Focus Group (group of people in discussion)

3. **Ethical Considerations Checklist**
   Description: A visual checklist of ethical considerations in community-based research:
   - [ ] Informed Consent
   - [ ] Confidentiality

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to understand the difference between traditional and participatory research methods.
   **Tip**: Use a comparison chart to clearly illustrate the differences in approach, roles, and outcomes between traditional and participatory research.

2. **Challenge**: Some students might dominate group discussions or activities.
   **Tip**: Implement structured turn-taking in discussions and assign specific roles in group activities to ensure equal participation.

3. **Challenge**: Students may find it difficult to imagine applying PRA techniques in real-world situations.
   **Tip**: Provide concrete examples of PRA techniques applied in Timor-Leste or similar contexts. Consider inviting a guest speaker with field experience to share their insights.

4. **Challenge**: Role-playing exercises may feel awkward or unnatural for some students.
   **Tip**: Start with a simple warm-up exercise to help students get comfortable with role-playing. Provide clear guidelines and scenarios to structure the activity.

5. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with the ethical complexities of community-based research.
   **Tip**: Use case studies to illustrate ethical dilemmas and guide students through a decision-making process. Encourage open discussion about potential ethical issues.

6. **Challenge**: Designing a participatory research project may be overwhelming for students new to the concept.
   **Tip**: Break down the project design process into smaller steps. Provide examples of successful projects and offer one-on-one guidance during the planning stage.
