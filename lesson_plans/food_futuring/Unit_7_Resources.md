## Current Food Policy Landscape in Timor-Leste

### Historical Context
- Independence in 2002 led to need for new national policies
- Initial focus on emergency food aid and rebuilding infrastructure
- Gradual shift towards long-term food security and nutrition strategies

### Key Policy Documents
1. National Food and Nutrition Security Policy (2017)
   - Aims to ensure food and nutrition security for all Timorese
   - Focuses on increasing agricultural productivity and improving nutrition
2. Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030
   - Includes goals for agriculture, rural development, and poverty reduction
3. National Nutrition Strategy 2014-2019
   - Targets reduction of malnutrition, especially in children under 5

### Current Challenges
- Limited implementation capacity
- Coordination issues between different government agencies
- Balancing traditional practices with modern agricultural techniques
- Climate change impacts on agriculture and food security

## Role of Different Stakeholders in Food Governance

### Government Agencies
1. Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries
   - Responsible for agricultural policy and development
   - Manages extension services and research programs
2. Ministry of Health
   - Oversees nutrition policies and programs
   - Conducts health and nutrition surveys
3. Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Environment
   - Regulates food safety and quality standards
   - Promotes agribusiness development

### NGOs and International Organizations

- Farmers' associations contribute to policy discussions
- Women's groups advocate for gender-sensitive food policies

## Community Participation in Food Policy-Making

### Mechanisms for Participation
