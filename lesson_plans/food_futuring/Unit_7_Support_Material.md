## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barrier:
   - Challenge: Some students may struggle with English terminology.
   - Solution: Provide a glossary of terms in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids to explain complex concepts.

2. Limited Prior Knowledge:
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of familiarity with food policy concepts.
   - Solution: Start with a brief overview of basic concepts. Use the warm-up activity to assess and address knowledge gaps.

3. Engaging with Policy Documents:
   - Challenge: Students might find policy documents dry or difficult to understand.
   - Solution: Use interactive activities like the jigsaw reading to break down complex documents. Relate policies to real-life scenarios students can connect with.

4. Balancing Local and Global Perspectives:
   - Challenge: Ensuring students understand both Timor-Leste specific issues and broader global food policy concepts.
   - Solution: Use comparative examples from other countries, but always bring the discussion back to the Timorese context.

5. Encouraging Critical Thinking:
   - Challenge: Moving beyond rote learning to analytical thinking about policy issues.
   - Solution: Use debate activities and case studies to encourage students to consider multiple perspectives and propose solutions.

6. Time Management:
   - Challenge: Covering all aspects of the lesson plan within the allocated time.
   - Solution: Prioritize key activities and be prepared to adjust the plan. Consider extending some activities into homework if necessary.

7. Technology Access:
   - Challenge: Uneven access to laptops or internet for research activities.
   - Solution: Prepare printed materials as backup. Consider pairing students or using a rotation system for computer access.
