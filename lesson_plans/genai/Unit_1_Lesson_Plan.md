Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 1: Foundations of Machine Learning and AI, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Foundations of Machine Learning and AI

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer with internet access
- Handouts with key vocabulary and concepts
- Jupyter Notebooks installed on students' laptops
- Access to a simple dataset for linear regression (e.g., height vs. weight)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define machine learning and its basic principles
- Distinguish between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
- Identify key components of a machine learning system (data, features, labels, models)
- Apply a simple linear regression model to real-world data

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to brainstorm in pairs: "What tasks do you think computers can learn to do?"
- Have pairs share their ideas with the class and create a mind map on the whiteboard

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Machine Learning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Training Data
- Features
- Labels
- Model

Provide handouts with definitions for students to reference throughout the lesson.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### Introduction to AI and Machine Learning
- Define AI and its relationship to machine learning
- Explain the basic principle of machine learning: learning from data

### Types of Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning: learning from labeled data
- Unsupervised Learning: finding patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement Learning: learning through interaction with an environment

### Basic Concepts
- Training Data: the information used to teach the model
- Features: the input variables used to make predictions
- Labels: the output or target variable in supervised learning
- Models: the mathematical representations learned from data

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Activity 1: Identifying Machine Learning Types
- Provide students with a list of scenarios and have them identify which type of machine learning would be most appropriate (supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement)

### Activity 2: Feature Identification
- Present a problem (e.g., predicting house prices) and have students brainstorm potential features that could be used in a machine learning model

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

### Task 1: Group Discussion on AI Applications in Timor-Leste
- Divide the class into small groups
- Each group discusses and lists potential AI applications relevant to Timor-Leste's development
- Groups present their ideas to the class

### Task 2: Hands-on Linear Regression Exercise
- Guide students through a simple linear regression exercise using Jupyter Notebooks
- Use a dataset relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., agricultural yield vs. rainfall)
- Demonstrate how to train the model and make predictions

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Address any questions or misconceptions
- Preview the next lesson on deep learning and neural networks

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a short report (500 words) on a potential AI application for a specific sector in Timor-Leste (e.g., healthcare, education, agriculture)
- Complete the linear regression exercise with a different dataset provided

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Machine Learning: A subset of AI that focuses on creating systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data
- Artificial Intelligence: The simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn like humans
- Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data
- Unsupervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the model finds patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement Learning: A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment
- Training Data: The dataset used to teach a machine learning model
- Features: The input variables or attributes used by a model to make predictions
- Labels: The output or target variable that the model is trying to predict in supervised learning
- Model: A mathematical representation of a real-world process, learned from data
