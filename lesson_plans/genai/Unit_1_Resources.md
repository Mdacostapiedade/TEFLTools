## 1. Lecture Notes

### Introduction to AI and Machine Learning

#### What is Artificial Intelligence?
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science dedicated to creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
- These tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.
- AI systems can learn from experience, adjust to new inputs, and perform human-like tasks.

#### What is Machine Learning?
- Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.
- Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML allows systems to learn patterns from data.
- The core idea: Let machines learn from data, rather than being explicitly programmed.

#### The Relationship between AI and ML
- ML is a key approach to achieving AI.
- While AI is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider "smart," ML is a specific way of achieving AI.
- Not all AI involves machine learning, but machine learning is currently the most promising path to developing advanced AI systems.

### Types of Machine Learning

#### Supervised Learning
- Definition: Learning from labeled data to predict outcomes for unforeseen data.
- The algorithm learns from a training dataset that includes both the input data and the correct output labels.
- Goal: Learn a function that maps inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs.
- Examples: 
  * Classification (e.g., spam detection in emails)
  * Regression (e.g., predicting house prices)

#### Unsupervised Learning
- Definition: Finding patterns or structures in unlabeled data.
- The algorithm learns from a dataset without labeled outputs.
- Goal: Discover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data.
- Examples:
  * Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation)
  * Dimensionality reduction (e.g., feature extraction)

#### Reinforcement Learning
- Definition: Learning through interaction with an environment.
- The algorithm (agent) learns by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties as it performs actions in an environment.
- Goal: Learn a strategy to maximize cumulative reward.
- Examples:
  * Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo)
  * Robotics (e.g., learning to walk)

### Basic Concepts in Machine Learning

#### Training Data
- Definition: The dataset used to teach a machine learning model.
- Consists of many examples that the model can learn from.
- In supervised learning, includes both input features and output labels.
- Quality and quantity of training data significantly impact model performance.

#### Features
- Definition: The individual measurable properties or characteristics of the phenomena being observed.
- Input variables used by the model to make predictions.
- Feature selection and engineering are crucial steps in building effective ML models.
- Examples: In a house price prediction model, features might include square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

#### Labels
- Definition: The output or target variable that the model is trying to predict in supervised learning.
- What we're trying to forecast or classify.
- Examples: In spam detection, labels would be "spam" or "not spam"; in house price prediction, the label would be the price.

#### Models
- Definition: The mathematical representation learned from data.
- Captures patterns in the training data to make predictions on new, unseen data.
- Different types of models are suited for different types of problems (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks).
