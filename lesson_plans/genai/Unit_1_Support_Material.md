Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Foundations of Machine Learning and AI, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material: Foundations of Machine Learning and AI

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Machine Learning**: A subset of AI that focuses on creating systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data
- **Artificial Intelligence**: The simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn like humans
- **Supervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the model finds patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment
- **Training Data**: The dataset used to teach a machine learning model
- **Features**: The input variables or attributes used by a model to make predictions
- **Labels**: The output or target variable that the model is trying to predict in supervised learning
- **Model**: A mathematical representation of a real-world process, learned from data

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Machine Learning Types Diagram**:
   A flowchart showing the three main types of machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement) with brief descriptions and example applications for each.

2. **AI and Machine Learning Venn Diagram**:
   A Venn diagram illustrating the relationship between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, with examples in each category.

3. **Linear Regression Visual**:
   A scatter plot showing data points and a best-fit line, illustrating the concept of linear regression.

4. **Feature and Label Illustration**:
   A table or image showing example features and labels for a house price prediction problem (e.g., features: square footage, number of bedrooms; label: price).

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Machine Learning Type Identification Worksheet**:
   A list of 10 scenarios where students must identify the most appropriate type of machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement).

2. **Feature Brainstorming Worksheet**:
   A template for students to brainstorm and list potential features for different machine learning problems relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., crop yield prediction, tourism demand forecasting).

3. **AI Application in Timor-Leste Idea Sheet**:
   A structured worksheet for groups to document their ideas for AI applications in Timor-Leste, including problem statement, proposed solution, and potential impact.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners" by Oliver Theobald
2. Coursera course: "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng
3. Kaggle's "Intro to Machine Learning" tutorial
4. Google's Machine Learning Crash Course
5. "AI for Everyone" course on Coursera by Andrew Ng
6. TensorFlow Playground for visualizing neural networks

## 5. Tips for Teachers

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with the mathematical concepts behind machine learning.
   **Solution**: Focus on intuitive explanations and real-world examples. Use visual aids and interactive demonstrations to illustrate concepts.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to computing resources for hands-on exercises.
   **Solution**: Use cloud-based platforms like Google Colab or Kaggle Notebooks for exercises. Prepare offline alternatives or group activities if internet access is unreliable.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty relating AI concepts to the Timorese context.
   **Solution**: Consistently use local examples and encourage students to brainstorm applications relevant to their communities. Invite local professionals or government officials to share insights.

4. **Challenge**: Varying levels of prior knowledge among students.
   **Solution**: Provide additional resources for both beginners and more advanced students. Consider implementing a peer mentoring system within the class.

5. **Challenge**: Overcoming language barriers, especially with technical terms.
   **Solution**: Create a bilingual glossary of key terms (English and Tetum). Use visual aids and demonstrations to supplement verbal explanations.
