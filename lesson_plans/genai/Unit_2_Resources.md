# Resources for Learning Unit 2: Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Introduction to Neural Networks

#### Basic Structure
- Neural networks are inspired by the human brain
- Composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers
- Typical structure: input layer, hidden layer(s), output layer
- Each connection has a weight that determines its importance

#### Information Flow
- Input data enters through the input layer
- Data is processed through hidden layers
- Each neuron applies an activation function to its inputs
- Output is produced at the output layer

#### Training Process
- Neural networks learn by adjusting weights
- Uses backpropagation algorithm to minimize error
- Gradient descent optimizes the network's performance

### Deep Learning Architectures

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Specialized for processing grid-like data (e.g., images)
- Use convolutional layers to detect features
- Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions
- Fully connected layers for final classification

#### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Designed for sequential data (e.g., time series, text)
- Contains loops to allow information persistence
- Variants like LSTM and GRU address long-term dependencies

#### Transformers
- Attention-based architecture
- Excels at processing sequential data
- Forms the basis for many modern language models

### The Role of GPUs in Deep Learning

#### Why GPUs are Important
- Deep learning requires massive parallel computations
- GPUs are designed for parallel processing
- Can significantly speed up training and inference

#### How GPUs Accelerate Deep Learning
- Matrix operations are efficiently performed on GPUs
- Allows for processing of larger datasets and models
- Enables real-time applications of deep learning
