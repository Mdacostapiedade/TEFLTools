# Support Material: Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Neural network**: A computing system inspired by biological neural networks, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information.
- **Deep learning**: A subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers between the input and output layers.
- **Layer**: A group of neurons in a neural network that process a certain aspect of the input data.
- **Neuron (artificial)**: A computational unit in a neural network that receives input, applies an activation function, and produces output.
- **Activation function**: A mathematical function that determines the output of a neural network node.
- **Backpropagation**: An algorithm used to calculate gradients in neural networks, which is essential for training the network.
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: A specialized processor designed to accelerate graphics rendering, which is also highly effective for parallel processing in deep learning.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A type of deep learning model particularly effective for image processing tasks.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: A type of neural network designed to work with sequential data, such as time series or natural language.
