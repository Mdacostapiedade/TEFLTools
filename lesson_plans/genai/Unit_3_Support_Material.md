Here's the support material for the lesson on Natural Language Processing and Word Embeddings, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material: Natural Language Processing and Word Embeddings

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A field of AI focused on the interaction between computers and human language
- **Tokenization**: The process of breaking down text into individual words or subwords
- **Part-of-speech tagging**: Assigning grammatical categories (e.g., noun, verb) to words in a text
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., person names, locations) in text
- **Word embedding**: A learned representation for text where words with similar meanings have similar representations
- **Vector space**: A mathematical space where word embeddings are represented as vectors
- **Semantic similarity**: The degree of relatedness between words or phrases based on their meaning
- **Corpus**: A large collection of texts used for linguistic analysis and model training
- **Lemmatization**: The process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form
- **Sentiment analysis**: The process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **NLP Pipeline Diagram**: A flowchart showing the typical steps in an NLP pipeline, including:
   - Text input
   - Tokenization
   - Part-of-speech tagging
   - Named Entity Recognition
   - Sentiment Analysis
   - Output/Results

2. **Word Embedding Visualization**: A 2D or 3D plot showing word vectors in space, with similar words clustered together. Include examples like:
   - "king", "queen", "man", "woman" to show gender relationships
   - "Dili", "Timor-Leste", "Jakarta", "Indonesia" to show country-capital relationships

3. **Word2Vec Skip-gram Model**: A simplified diagram showing:
   - Input word
   - Hidden layer
   - Output context words

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **NLP Tasks Matching Exercise**: A worksheet where students match NLP tasks with their descriptions and examples.

2. **Word Analogy Practice**: A handout with word analogy problems to solve using word embeddings, e.g., "man is to woman as king is to ____".

3. **NLP Applications Brainstorming Sheet**: A structured worksheet for students to brainstorm potential NLP applications in Timor-Leste, considering different sectors like education, healthcare, and government.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Speech and Language Processing" by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin (Chapter on Word Vectors)
2. Stanford University's CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning course materials
3. TensorFlow tutorials on word embeddings: https://www.tensorflow.org/text/guide/word_embeddings
4. "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space" by Mikolov et al. (original Word2Vec paper)
5. GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation project page: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with the mathematical concepts behind word embeddings.
   **Solution**: Use more visual representations and analogies. Compare word embeddings to placing words on a map, where similar words are closer together.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in relating NLP concepts to Tetum or Portuguese languages.
   **Solution**: Prepare examples specific to these languages beforehand. If possible, find or create small word embedding models for Tetum or Portuguese to demonstrate.

3. **Challenge**: Limited computational resources for running word embedding models.
   **Solution**: Use pre-computed embeddings or online tools that don't require local computation. Alternatively, use smaller, simplified models for demonstration purposes.

4. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by the technical aspects of NLP.
   **Solution**: Start with more intuitive, high-level explanations before diving into technical details. Use real-world applications and examples to maintain engagement.

5. **Challenge**: Varying levels of programming experience among students.
   **Solution**: Provide code templates and step-by-step guides for hands-on exercises. Consider pairing students with different skill levels for peer learning.
