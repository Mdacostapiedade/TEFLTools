Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 4: Introduction to Large Language Models, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Large Language Models

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with internet access for each student or pair of students
- Projector and screen for presentations
- Access to GPT-3 or a similar LLM playground
- Handouts with key vocabulary and concepts
- Whiteboard and markers

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the evolution of language models
- Describe the basic architecture of transformer models
- Understand the capabilities and limitations of GPT models
- Interact with a large language model using prompts
- Identify potential applications of LLMs in Timorese education and government

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to brainstorm in pairs: "What tasks do you think a computer can perform with language?"
- Have pairs share their ideas with the class and create a list on the whiteboard

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Language model
- Transformer
- Attention mechanism
- Self-attention
- Encoder-decoder architecture
- Fine-tuning
- Few-shot learning

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### 5.1 Evolution of Language Models
- Brief history of language models (n-grams, neural networks)
- Limitations of previous models

### 5.2 Transformer Architecture
- Introduction to the transformer model
- Key components: self-attention, multi-head attention, feed-forward networks
- Advantages over previous architectures

### 5.3 GPT Models and Their Capabilities
- Overview of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models
- Capabilities: text generation, summarization, translation, question-answering
- Limitations and challenges

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### 6.1 Transformer Architecture Visualization
- Students work in small groups to create a visual representation of the transformer architecture using provided materials (paper, markers, sticky notes)
- Groups present their visualizations to the class

### 6.2 GPT Model Exploration
- Guided exploration of GPT-3 or similar LLM playground
- Students experiment with different prompts and observe the model's outputs

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

### 7.1 Hands-on Session with LLM
- Students work individually or in pairs to complete a series of tasks using the LLM playground:
  1. Generate a short story set in Timor-Leste
  2. Summarize a given text about Timorese history
  3. Translate a paragraph from Tetum to English or Portuguese
  4. Answer questions about Timorese culture and traditions

### 7.2 Group Discussion on LLM Applications
- Divide the class into small groups
- Each group brainstorms potential uses of LLMs in Timorese education and government
- Groups present their ideas to the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Address any questions or misconceptions
- Highlight key takeaways about LLMs and their potential impact on Timor-Leste

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 500-word essay on one potential application of LLMs in either Timorese education or government
- Prepare three thoughtful questions about LLMs and their implications for Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Language model: A statistical model that predicts the probability of a sequence of words
- Transformer: A neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data
- Attention mechanism: A technique that allows a model to focus on different parts of the input when producing output
- Self-attention: A type of attention where the model attends to different parts of its own input
- Encoder-decoder architecture: A model structure with separate components for processing input and generating output
- Fine-tuning: The process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task or domain
- Few-shot learning: The ability of a model to learn from a small number of examples
