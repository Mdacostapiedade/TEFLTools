# Support Material for Introduction to Large Language Models

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Language model**: A statistical model that predicts the probability of a sequence of words
- **Transformer**: A neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data
- **Attention mechanism**: A technique that allows a model to focus on different parts of the input when producing output
- **Self-attention**: A type of attention where the model attends to different parts of its own input
- **Encoder-decoder architecture**: A model structure with separate components for processing input and generating output
- **Fine-tuning**: The process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task or domain
- **Few-shot learning**: The ability of a model to learn from a small number of examples
- **Prompt**: A text input given to a language model to generate a response or perform a task
- **Token**: A unit of text (e.g., word, subword, or character) processed by the language model
- **Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)**: A type of large language model that uses the transformer architecture and is trained on vast amounts of text data

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with technical concepts
   - **Tip**: Use analogies and real-world examples to explain complex ideas. For instance, compare self-attention to students focusing on different parts of a textbook while studying.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to LLM playgrounds or APIs
   - **Tip**: Prepare screenshots or videos demonstrating LLM interactions. Consider using free alternatives like GPT-2 output generators if API access is unavailable.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty in relating LLMs to the Timorese context
   - **Tip**: Provide specific examples of how LLMs could be used in Timor-Leste, such as generating educational content in Tetum or assisting with government document translation.

4. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by the rapid progress in AI
   - **Tip**: Emphasize that understanding the fundamental concepts is more important than knowing every detail. Encourage students to focus on the potential applications and implications rather than the technical intricacies.

5. **Challenge**: Varying levels of English proficiency among students
   - **Tip**: Provide key terms and definitions in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and demonstrations to support explanations.

6. **Challenge**: Limited background in machine learning or computer science
   - **Tip**: Start with basic concepts and build up gradually. Use interactive demonstrations and hands-on activities to make abstract concepts more concrete.
