Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 5: Generative AI Applications and Use Cases, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Generative AI Applications and Use Cases

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with internet access for each student or group
- Projector for demonstrations
- Access to various generative AI tools (e.g., GPT-3, DALL-E, Midjourney, GitHub Copilot)
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with key vocabulary and concepts

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify and describe various applications of generative AI
- Explain the potential impact of generative AI on different sectors in Timor-Leste
- Demonstrate basic usage of generative AI tools
- Develop a proposal for a generative AI application addressing a local challenge

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Brainstorming session: Students share their ideas on what generative AI could potentially create or assist with in various fields (e.g., art, writing, programming, music)
- Instructor writes ideas on the whiteboard, grouping them by category

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  - Text generation
  - Text summarization
  - Image generation
  - Audio generation
  - Code generation
  - Prompt engineering
- Provide examples for each term and discuss their potential applications

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of generative AI applications:
  - Text generation and summarization (e.g., GPT-3, T5)
  - Image generation (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
  - Audio generation (e.g., Jukebox, WaveNet)
  - Code generation and assistance (e.g., GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex)
- Discuss potential impacts on different sectors in Timor-Leste:
  - Education
  - Agriculture
  - Tourism
  - Healthcare
  - Government services

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Rotate through stations demonstrating various generative AI tools:
  1. Text generation using GPT-3
  2. Image creation with DALL-E or Midjourney
  3. Code assistance with GitHub Copilot
  4. Audio generation (if available) or additional text summarization task
- At each station, students experiment with the tools and discuss potential applications for Timor-Leste

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

- Group project: Develop a proposal for a generative AI application addressing a local challenge in Timor-Leste
- Students work in groups to:
  1. Identify a specific challenge in Timor-Leste
  2. Propose a generative AI solution
  3. Outline the potential benefits and implementation challenges
  4. Prepare a brief presentation

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (20 minutes)

- Each group presents their proposal (2-3 minutes per group)
- Class discussion on the most promising ideas and potential challenges
- Recap of key concepts and applications covered in the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Individual research task: Students choose one generative AI application and research its current state, limitations, and potential future developments
- Write a 500-word report on their findings, including potential implications for Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Text generation: The process of creating human-like text using AI models
- Text summarization: Automatically condensing longer texts into shorter, coherent summaries
- Image generation: Creating new images from textual descriptions or other inputs using AI
- Audio generation: Producing artificial speech or music using AI models
- Code generation: Automatically creating or suggesting programming code based on natural language inputs or existing codebases
- Prompt engineering: The practice of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to guide AI models in producing desired outputs
