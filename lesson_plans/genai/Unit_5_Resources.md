# Resources for Learning Unit 5: Generative AI Applications and Use Cases

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Text Generation and Summarization

#### Introduction
- Text generation is the process of creating human-like text using AI models
- Text summarization involves automatically condensing longer texts into shorter, coherent summaries
- Both rely on large language models trained on vast amounts of text data

#### Key Technologies
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models: GPT-3, GPT-4
- T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for summarization

#### Applications
- Content creation: articles, stories, marketing copy
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Automated report generation
- Language translation
- Text summarization for research and news

#### Potential Impact on Timor-Leste
- Education: Generating learning materials in Tetum and Portuguese
- Government: Summarizing policy documents and reports
- Media: Assisting in news article creation and translation

### Image and Audio Generation

#### Introduction
- Image generation creates new images from textual descriptions or other inputs
- Audio generation produces artificial speech or music

#### Key Technologies
- Image Generation: DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion
- Audio Generation: Jukebox, WaveNet, Tacotron

#### Applications
- Art and design: Creating unique visuals for various purposes
- Marketing: Generating product images and advertisements
- Entertainment: Producing concept art, music, and sound effects
- Education: Creating visual aids and illustrations

#### Potential Impact on Timor-Leste
- Tourism: Generating promotional images and virtual tours
- Cultural preservation: Recreating historical scenes or traditional art
- Education: Creating visual learning materials

### Code Generation and Assistance

#### Introduction
- Code generation automatically creates or suggests programming code based on natural language inputs or existing codebases

#### Key Technologies
- GitHub Copilot
- OpenAI Codex
- TabNine

#### Applications
- Software development: Accelerating coding processes
- Education: Assisting in teaching programming
- Prototyping: Quickly generating code for proof-of-concept projects

#### Potential Impact on Timor-Leste
- Education: Enhancing computer science education
- Economic development: Supporting local tech startups and innovation
- Government: Improving efficiency in software development for public services

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How might text generation and summarization technologies be used to preserve and promote Timorese languages and culture?
2. What are the potential benefits and risks of using AI-generated images for tourism promotion in Timor-Leste?
3. How could code generation tools impact the development of a local tech industry in Timor-Leste?
4. What ethical considerations should be taken into account when implementing generative AI technologies in Timor-Leste's public sector?
5. How might generative AI applications help address challenges in Timor-Leste's education system?
6. What role could generative AI play in supporting Timor-Leste's agricultural sector?
7. How can Timor-Leste ensure that the benefits of generative AI are distributed equitably across its population?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

### Exercise: Crafting Effective Prompts for Generative AI

1. Choose one of the following generative AI applications:
   - Text generation (e.g., GPT-3)
   - Image generation (e.g., DALL-E)
   - Code generation (e.g., GitHub Copilot)

2. Identify a specific task relevant to Timor-Leste's development (e.g., generating a tourism brochure, creating an educational illustration, or coding a simple web application for government services).

3. Write three different prompts for your chosen AI tool to accomplish the task. Each prompt should be progressively more detailed and specific.

4. Test your prompts (if possible) or predict the expected outcomes based on your understanding of the AI tool.

5. Reflect on the effectiveness of each prompt, considering factors such as clarity, specificity, and relevance to the Timorese context.

6. Write a short paragraph (150-200 words) explaining which prompt you think would be most effective and why.

## 4. Assignment Details

### Group Project: Generative AI Application Proposal for Timor-Leste

#### Objective
Develop a proposal for a generative AI application that addresses a specific local challenge in Timor-Leste.

#### Instructions
1. Form groups of 3-4 students.
2. Identify a specific challenge in Timor-Leste that could potentially be addressed using generative AI.
3. Research existing generative AI technologies that could be applied to this challenge.
4. Develop a proposal that includes:
   - A clear description of the challenge
   - The proposed generative AI solution
   - Potential benefits of the solution
   - Implementation challenges and how they might be addressed
   - Ethical considerations
   - A basic implementation plan

#### Deliverables
1. A written proposal (1000-1500 words)
2. A 5-minute presentation to the class
3. A visual aid (e.g., poster, infographic, or slides) to support the presentation

#### Evaluation Criteria
- Relevance and potential impact of the proposed solution
- Understanding and appropriate application of generative AI concepts
- Consideration of implementation challenges and ethical issues
- Clarity and persuasiveness of the written proposal and presentation
- Creativity and innovation in addressing the chosen challenge

## 5. Additional Materials and Examples

### Case Study: GPT-3 for Language Preservation

The University of Cambridge has been exploring the use of GPT-3 to help preserve endangered languages. They've been working on generating text in Barngarla, an Aboriginal language from South Australia with no fluent speakers left.

Key points:
- GPT-3 was fine-tuned on limited available Barngarla texts
- The model can generate new sentences and even short stories in Barngarla
- This approach could potentially be applied to Timorese languages with limited speakers

Discussion: How might a similar approach be used to preserve and revitalize lesser-spoken languages in Timor-Leste?

### Example: AI-Generated Art for Cultural Promotion

Show examples of AI-generated artwork inspired by Timorese cultural elements, created using tools like DALL-E or Midjourney. Discuss how these could be used in tourism promotion or cultural education.

Prompt example: "Create a digital painting in the style of Timorese tais fabric, featuring symbols of Timor-Leste's landscape and culture."

### Demonstration: Code Generation for Local App Development

Provide a live demonstration or video of using GitHub Copilot to assist in coding a simple mobile app that could be useful in Timor-Leste, such as a crop price checker for farmers or a basic language learning tool.

### Resource List: Generative AI Tools and Platforms

Compile a list of accessible generative AI tools and platforms that students can experiment with, including:
- OpenAI's GPT-3 Playground
- Hugging Face's model playground
- DALL-E or Midjourney (for image generation)
- GitHub Copilot (for code generation)
- Google's Bard or Anthropic's Claude (as alternatives to GPT)

Include brief descriptions and links to tutorials or documentation for each tool.
