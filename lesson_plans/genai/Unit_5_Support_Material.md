Here's the support material for the lesson on Generative AI Applications and Use Cases, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material: Generative AI Applications and Use Cases

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Generative AI**: AI systems that can create new content, such as text, images, audio, or code.
- **Text generation**: The process of creating human-like text using AI models.
- **Text summarization**: Automatically condensing longer texts into shorter, coherent summaries.
- **Image generation**: Creating new images from textual descriptions or other inputs using AI.
- **Audio generation**: Producing artificial speech or music using AI models.
- **Code generation**: Automatically creating or suggesting programming code based on natural language inputs or existing codebases.
- **Prompt engineering**: The practice of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to guide AI models in producing desired outputs.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A branch of AI focused on the interaction between computers and human language.
- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: Advanced AI models trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Generative AI Applications Flowchart**
   Description: A flowchart showing the various types of generative AI applications (text, image, audio, code) and their potential outputs. Arrows connect each application type to example outputs (e.g., text generation â†’ articles, stories, summaries).

2. **Prompt Engineering Process Diagram**
   Description: A circular diagram illustrating the iterative process of prompt engineering: 1) Craft prompt, 2) Generate output, 3) Evaluate results, 4) Refine prompt. Arrows connect each step in a clockwise direction.

3. **Generative AI Impact on Timor-Leste Sectors**
   Description: A mind map with "Generative AI" at the center, branching out to different sectors (Education, Agriculture, Tourism, Healthcare, Government). Each sector branch further splits into potential applications or benefits.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Generative AI Tool Exploration Worksheet**
   Content: A table with columns for Tool Name, Type of Generation, Sample Prompt Used, Output Generated, and Potential Applications in Timor-Leste. Students fill this out as they rotate through the practice activity stations.

2. **Generative AI Application Proposal Template**
   Content: A structured template for the group project, including sections for:
   - Problem Statement
   - Proposed Generative AI Solution
   - Potential Benefits
   - Implementation Challenges
   - Resources Needed

3. **Ethical Considerations Checklist**
   Content: A list of ethical considerations to keep in mind when developing generative AI applications, such as data privacy, bias, environmental impact, and potential job displacement. Students use this checklist when developing their proposals.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Limited internet connectivity**
   - Prepare offline demonstrations or screenshots of generative AI tools
   - Use locally installed, lighter versions of AI models when possible

2. **Varying levels of technical background**
   - Pair students with different skill levels for group activities
   - Provide additional resources for students who need more background information

3. **Language barriers**
   - Use simple, clear language in explanations
   - Provide visual aids and demonstrations to support verbal explanations
   - Encourage peer translation and explanation

4. **Ethical concerns**
   - Address ethical considerations throughout the lesson, not just at the end
   - Encourage open discussion and critical thinking about potential negative impacts

5. **Lack of local examples**
   - Research and prepare relevant examples from Timor-Leste or similar developing countries
   - Invite local guest speakers from tech companies or government IT departments

6. **Overwhelm from rapid technological advancements**
   - Focus on foundational concepts that apply across different tools and models
   - Emphasize the importance of adaptability and continuous learning in the field of AI

7. **Difficulty in accessing cutting-edge AI tools**
   - Utilize free or educational versions of AI tools when available
   - Demonstrate tools via screen sharing if individual access is not possible
   - Encourage students to explore open-source alternatives
