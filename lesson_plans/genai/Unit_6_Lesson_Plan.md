Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 6: Prompt Engineering and Effective Use of LLMs, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Prompt Engineering and Effective Use of LLMs

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with internet access for each student or pair of students
- Access to an LLM interface (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3 playground or similar)
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with prompt engineering guidelines and examples
- Projector for demonstrations

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand the principles of effective prompt engineering
- Apply various prompt engineering techniques to improve LLM outputs
- Recognize the importance of in-context learning and few-shot learning
- Create and refine prompts for specific tasks relevant to Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into pairs
- Each pair receives a poorly written prompt and must improve it in 5 minutes
- Pairs share their improved prompts with the class, discussing their changes

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Prompt engineering
- In-context learning
- Few-shot learning
- Zero-shot learning
- Prompt components (instruction, context, input, output format)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### 5.1 Principles of Prompt Engineering
- Clarity and specificity
- Providing context and examples
- Structuring prompts effectively

### 5.2 In-context Learning and Few-shot Learning
- Explanation and examples of each technique
- When and how to use them effectively

### 5.3 Best Practices for Interacting with LLMs
- Iterative refinement of prompts
- Handling biases and limitations
- Ensuring output quality and relevance

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### 6.1 Guided Practice (20 minutes)
- Demonstrate prompt engineering techniques using the projector
- Students follow along on their computers, experimenting with variations

### 6.2 Independent Practice (20 minutes)
- Students work individually to create prompts for given scenarios
- Scenarios should be relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., tourism promotion, agricultural advice)

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

### 7.1 Prompt Engineering Workshop (30 minutes)
- Students work in small groups to create a series of prompts for a specific task
- Tasks could include: generating educational content in Tetum, creating a tourism chatbot, or drafting policy recommendations

### 7.2 Prompt Competition (15 minutes)
- Groups exchange their best prompts
- Each group tests and evaluates the prompts they received
- Class votes on the most effective prompt for each task

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key principles of prompt engineering
- Discuss challenges encountered and strategies for overcoming them
- Highlight successful prompts from the competition and analyze why they worked well

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Create a set of 5 prompts for a specific application relevant to Timor-Leste's development
- Write a short reflection (300-500 words) on the potential impact of effective prompt engineering in the chosen application area

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- **Prompt Engineering**: The practice of designing and refining input prompts to effectively communicate with and elicit desired outputs from large language models.
- **In-context Learning**: The ability of an LLM to adapt its behavior based on examples or instructions provided within the prompt itself.
- **Few-shot Learning**: A technique where the model is given a few examples of the desired task within the prompt to guide its performance.
- **Zero-shot Learning**: The model's ability to perform a task without any specific examples, relying solely on its pre-trained knowledge.
- **Prompt Components**: The various elements that make up an effective prompt, including instructions, context, input data, and desired output format.
