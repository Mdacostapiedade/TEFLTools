Here's the support material for the lesson on Prompt Engineering and Effective Use of LLMs, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Prompt Engineering and Effective Use of LLMs

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Prompt Engineering**: The practice of designing and refining input prompts to effectively communicate with and elicit desired outputs from large language models.
- **In-context Learning**: The ability of an LLM to adapt its behavior based on examples or instructions provided within the prompt itself.
- **Few-shot Learning**: A technique where the model is given a few examples of the desired task within the prompt to guide its performance.
- **Zero-shot Learning**: The model's ability to perform a task without any specific examples, relying solely on its pre-trained knowledge.
- **Prompt Components**: The various elements that make up an effective prompt, including instructions, context, input data, and desired output format.
- **Iterative Refinement**: The process of gradually improving a prompt through multiple revisions based on the model's outputs.
- **Output Format**: The specified structure or style in which the LLM should present its response.
- **Task-specific Prompting**: Tailoring prompts to suit particular types of tasks or desired outcomes.
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: A technique that encourages the model to show its reasoning process step-by-step.
- **Prompt Templating**: Creating reusable prompt structures that can be filled with different content for similar tasks.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Prompt Components Diagram**
   Description: A flowchart-style diagram showing the four main components of an effective prompt:
   - Instruction (at the top)
   - Context (on the left)
   - Input (on the right)
   - Output Format (at the bottom)
   Arrows connect these components to a central "Prompt" box.

2. **Prompt Engineering Process Cycle**
   Description: A circular diagram illustrating the iterative nature of prompt engineering:
   - Draft Initial Prompt
   - Test with LLM
   - Analyze Output
   - Identify Improvements
   - Refine Prompt
   Arrows connect these steps in a clockwise direction, with "Refine Prompt" leading back to "Test with LLM".

3. **Few-shot vs. Zero-shot Learning Comparison**
   Description: A side-by-side comparison showing:
   - Few-shot: Prompt with examples, followed by new input and output
   - Zero-shot: Prompt with only instructions, followed by input and output

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to understand the concept of prompt engineering.
   **Tip**: Use analogies comparing prompt engineering to giving clear instructions to a very intelligent but literal-minded person. Provide plenty of examples and encourage hands-on experimentation.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in accessing or using LLM interfaces.
   **Tip**: Prepare alternative options such as simplified web-based interfaces or API wrappers. Have a backup plan with pre-generated outputs if internet access is unreliable.

3. **Challenge**: Students becoming frustrated with inconsistent LLM outputs.
   **Tip**: Emphasize the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the importance of iterative refinement. Encourage students to view unexpected outputs as learning opportunities.

4. **Challenge**: Ensuring prompts are culturally relevant to Timor-Leste.
   **Tip**: Collaborate with local experts or community members to develop a bank of Timor-Leste-specific scenarios and examples. Encourage students to draw from their own experiences and knowledge.

5. **Challenge**: Addressing ethical concerns about AI and LLMs.
   **Tip**: Integrate discussions about ethics throughout the lesson. Encourage critical thinking about the implications of using AI in various contexts, especially in Timor-Leste's development.

6. **Challenge**: Varying levels of English proficiency among students.
   **Tip**: Provide key terms and instructions in both English and Tetum. Consider pairing students with different language strengths for peer support.

7. **Challenge**: Limited prior exposure to AI concepts.
   **Tip**: Start with very basic examples and gradually increase complexity. Use visual aids and hands-on activities to reinforce abstract concepts.
