# Resources for Learning Unit 7: Ethical Considerations and Societal Impact

## 1. Lecture Notes

### AI Bias and Fairness

#### Introduction to AI Bias
- Definition: AI bias refers to systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create unfair outcomes.
- Sources of bias:
  1. Training data bias
  2. Algorithm bias
  3. Interaction bias
- Examples of AI bias:
  1. Facial recognition systems performing poorly on darker skin tones
  2. Resume screening algorithms favoring male candidates
  3. Predictive policing systems disproportionately targeting minority neighborhoods

#### Importance of Fairness in AI
- Fairness ensures equal treatment and opportunities for all individuals
- Prevents perpetuation and amplification of existing societal biases
- Builds trust in AI systems and promotes wider adoption

#### Strategies for Mitigating AI Bias
1. Diverse and representative training data
2. Regular audits of AI systems for bias
3. Inclusive development teams
4. Transparency in AI decision-making processes
5. Implementing fairness constraints in algorithms

### Privacy and Data Protection

#### AI and Data Privacy Challenges
- Large-scale data collection and analysis
- Potential for re-identification of anonymized data
- Lack of transparency in data usage and sharing
- Cross-border data flows and jurisdictional issues

#### Key Privacy Concepts
1. Informed consent
2. Data minimization
3. Purpose limitation
4. Data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure)
5. Privacy by design and default

#### Differential Privacy
- Definition: A system for publicly sharing information about a dataset by describing patterns of groups within the dataset while withholding information about individuals.
- Benefits:
  1. Protects individual privacy
  2. Allows for useful data analysis
  3. Resistant to linkage attacks
- Challenges:
  1. Complexity in implementation
  2. Trade-off between privacy and utility

#### Data Protection in Timor-Leste
- Current state of data protection legislation
- Comparison with international standards (e.g., GDPR)
- Recommendations for strengthening data protection in the context of AI adoption

### Economic and Social Implications for Timor-Leste

#### Potential Job Displacement
- Sectors at risk of automation in Timor-Leste
- Timeframe for potential job losses
- Strategies for workforce transition and reskilling

#### Job Creation and Economic Growth
- New job categories emerging from AI adoption
- Potential for increased productivity and economic output
- Opportunities for Timorese entrepreneurs in the AI sector

#### Impact on Traditional Industries
- Agriculture: Precision farming, crop prediction, pest control
- Fisheries: Sustainable fishing practices, stock management
- Tourism: Personalized recommendations, language translation services

#### AI for Social Good in Timor-Leste
- Healthcare: Improved diagnostics, telemedicine for rural areas
- Education: Personalized learning, language preservation
- Environmental protection: Climate change mitigation, biodiversity monitoring

#### Digital Divide Considerations
- Current state of digital infrastructure in Timor-Leste
- Strategies for ensuring equitable access to AI technologies
- Importance of digital literacy programs

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How might AI bias manifest in Timor-Leste's context, and what steps can be taken to mitigate it?

3. How can Timor-Leste balance the need for data-driven development with protecting citizens' privacy rights?
4. What policies should Timor-Leste consider implementing to ensure ethical AI development and deployment?
5. How might AI impact traditional cultural practices in Timor-Leste, and how can these be preserved?
6. What role should international organizations play in supporting ethical AI adoption in Timor-Leste?
7. How can Timor-Leste prepare its workforce for the potential disruptions caused by AI?
8. What are the ethical considerations of using AI for natural resource management in Timor-Leste?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. The most critical ethical consideration for AI adoption in Timor-Leste
   - Identify and explain the ethical issue
   - Discuss its potential impact on Timorese society
   - Propose strategies for addressing this ethical challenge

2. A proposal for ensuring fair and ethical AI implementation in a specific sector (e.g., agriculture, healthcare, education)
   - Choose a sector relevant to Timor-Leste
   - Outline the potential benefits and risks of AI adoption in this sector
   - Propose guidelines or policies to ensure ethical implementation

3. Comparative analysis of AI ethics policies in Timor-Leste and a neighboring country
   - Research and summarize the current AI ethics policies (if any) in Timor-Leste and a chosen neighboring country
   - Compare and contrast the approaches of both countries
   - Suggest best practices that Timor-Leste could adopt or adapt

## 4. Case Study for Group Analysis

### AI Implementation in Rwanda: The Use of Drones for Healthcare Delivery

Background:
In 2016, Rwanda partnered with Zipline, a California-based robotics company, to launch a drone delivery program for blood and medical supplies to remote health facilities.

Key Points:
- Drones can deliver blood and medical supplies to remote areas within 30 minutes
- The program has significantly reduced waste of blood products and improved emergency response times
- Privacy concerns have been raised about the collection of aerial imagery data
- Questions about long-term sustainability and dependence on foreign technology

Task:
Analyze this case study in your groups, considering the following aspects:
1. Ethical implications of the drone delivery program
2. Societal impact on healthcare access and outcomes
3. Economic considerations (cost-effectiveness, job creation/displacement)
4. Data privacy and security concerns
5. Lessons that Timor-Leste could learn from this implementation

Prepare a 10-minute presentation of your findings and recommendations for the class.

## 5. Debate Role Cards

### Pro-AI Adoption Team

Your team supports widespread AI adoption in Timor-Leste. Consider the following points:
- Potential for rapid economic development and increased competitiveness
- Improved efficiency in government services and resource allocation
- Enhanced educational opportunities through personalized learning
- Better healthcare outcomes through AI-assisted diagnostics and treatment planning
- Preservation and promotion of Timorese languages and culture through NLP technologies

### Cautious Approach Team

Your team advocates for a more measured approach to AI adoption in Timor-Leste. Consider the following points:
- Risks of job displacement and widening economic inequality
- Concerns about data privacy and potential surveillance
- The digital divide and unequal access to AI technologies
- Dependence on foreign technology and expertise
- Potential erosion of traditional cultural practices and values

Both teams should prepare arguments, anticipate counterarguments, and consider potential compromises or solutions that address the concerns of both sides.
