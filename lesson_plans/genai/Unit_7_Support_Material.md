## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Limited student familiarity with AI concepts
   **Solution**: Provide a brief recap of key AI concepts at the beginning of the lesson and use relatable, local examples throughout.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in relating global AI ethics issues to the Timorese context
   **Solution**: Encourage students to draw parallels between global issues and local challenges. Use guided questions to help them make connections.

3. **Challenge**: Engaging students in complex ethical discussions
   **Solution**: Use interactive methods like role-playing exercises or structured debates to make ethical discussions more engaging and relatable.

4. **Challenge**: Balancing technical content with ethical considerations
   **Solution**: Integrate ethical discussions throughout the technical explanations, rather than treating them as separate topics.

5. **Challenge**: Addressing potential cultural sensitivities around AI adoption
   **Solution**: Create a safe, respectful environment for discussion and encourage students to share their cultural perspectives on technology adoption.

6. **Challenge**: Limited real-world examples of AI implementation in Timor-Leste
   **Solution**: Use case studies from similar developing countries and encourage students to imagine how these examples could be adapted to the Timorese context.

7. **Challenge**: Varying levels of English proficiency among students
   **Solution**: Provide key terms and concepts in both English and Tetum, and allow students to discuss in their preferred language when working in groups.
