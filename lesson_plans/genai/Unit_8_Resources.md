# Resources for Learning Unit 8

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Emerging Trends in Generative AI and LLMs

#### Multimodal AI Models
- Definition: AI systems that can process and analyze multiple types of data simultaneously (e.g., text, images, audio)
- Examples:
  - DALL-E 2: Generates images from text descriptions
  - GPT-4: Processes both text and images as input
- Potential applications:
  - Enhanced language translation with visual context
  - More intuitive human-computer interaction
  - Advanced content creation tools

#### Recent Advancements in LLMs
- Increased model size and capabilities (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4)
- Improved few-shot learning and in-context learning
- Enhanced factual accuracy and reduced hallucinations
- Integration with external tools and APIs

### AI in Decision-making and Governance

#### Case Studies
1. Estonia's AI-powered e-governance system
   - Digital identity for citizens
   - AI-assisted public services
2. Singapore's AI in healthcare
   - Predictive analytics for patient care
   - AI-powered diagnosis assistance

#### Potential Benefits for Timor-Leste
- Improved efficiency in public services
