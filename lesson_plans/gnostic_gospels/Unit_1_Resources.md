# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "The Gnostic Religion" by Hans Jonas

"The gnostic systems went so far as to make ignorance the very essence of the world, and knowledge the essence of salvation. In this radical form we encounter the gnostic conception for instance in the "Evangelium Veritatis": "It is ignorance which brought about death, because those who came from Ignorance neither were nor are nor shall be.... It is within Unity that each one will attain himself; within knowledge he will purify himself from multiplicity into Unity, consuming matter within himself like fire, and darkness by light, death by life" (24:25-25:10). The same writing states that the world is the "ignorance of the Father," that the "Fall" occurred when He was not known, and that the rising of knowledge means the perishing of the world and of all beings: "If they gain knowledge, the world will dissolve" (Ev. Ver. 22:2-13). Ignorance enslaves, knowledge liberates: this is the burden of the gnostic gospel, frankly stated in many texts."

## Excerpt from "The Secret Teachings of Jesus" by Marvin W. Meyer

"The Secret Book of James, like other gnostic texts, emphasizes the importance of knowledge for salvation. In one passage Jesus declares to James and Peter, 'Become full of the spirit, but be lacking in reason, for reason belongs to the soul. It is its nature'" (p. 15).
