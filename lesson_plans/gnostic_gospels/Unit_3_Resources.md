## Selected Sayings from the Gospel of Thomas

1. "Jesus said, 'If your leaders say to you, "Look, the Kingdom is in the sky," then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, "It is in the sea," then the fish will precede you. Rather, the Kingdom is inside you and it is outside you.'"

2. "Jesus said, 'Know what is in front of your face, and what is hidden from you will be disclosed to you. For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed.'"

3. "Jesus said, 'If you bring forth what is within you, what you have will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not have will destroy you.'"

4. "Jesus said, 'I am the light that is over all things. I am all: from me all came forth, and to me all attained. Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there.'"

5. "Jesus said, 'The Kingdom of the Father is like a woman who took a little leaven, concealed it in some dough, and made it into large loaves. Let him who has ears hear.'"

- Discovery:
  * Found in 1945 near Nag Hammadi, Egypt
  * Part of a larger collection of Gnostic texts
  * Written in Coptic, likely translated from Greek

- Structure:
  * 114 sayings attributed to Jesus
  * No narrative framework or biographical information
  * Begins with: "These are the secret sayings that the living Jesus spoke and Didymos Judas Thomas recorded."

- Dating and Authorship:
  * Scholarly debate on composition date (50-140 CE)
  * Some argue for early date, potentially predating canonical gospels
  * Others suggest later composition influenced by developing Christian theology
  * Attributed to Didymos Judas Thomas, traditionally identified as the apostle Thomas

## Key Themes in the Gospel of Thomas

1. Self-knowledge and Divine Identity
   - Emphasis on knowing oneself as key to salvation
   - Concept of divine spark or light within humans
   - Example: Saying 3 - "When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will understand that you are children of the living Father."

2. Kingdom of God as Present Reality
   - Contrast with future-oriented eschatology in canonical gospels
   - Kingdom seen as a state of spiritual awareness
   - Example: Saying 113 - "His disciples said to him, 'When will the kingdom come?' Jesus said, 'It will not come by watching for it. It will not be said, "Look, here!" or "Look, there!" Rather, the Father's kingdom is spread out upon the earth, and people don't see it.'"

3. Transformation and Spiritual Awakening
   - Emphasis on personal transformation through knowledge
   - Rejection of external religious practices
   - Example: Saying 22 - "When you make the two into one, and when you make the inner like the outer and the outer like the inner... then you will enter [the kingdom]."

4. Rejection of Material World
   - Material existence seen as illusory or negative
   - Encouragement to transcend physical reality
   - Example: Saying 56 - "Jesus said, 'Whoever has come to understand the world has found (only) a corpse, and whoever has found a corpse is superior to the world.'"

## Comparison with Canonical Gospels

1. Similarities
   - Many sayings parallel those in Matthew, Mark, and Luke
   - Example: Thomas 9 parallels the Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13:1-9)
   - Use of parables and aphorisms

2. Differences
   - No narrative framework or passion story
   - Lack of emphasis on Jesus' death and resurrection
   - More esoteric and mystical teachings
   - Different interpretation of familiar sayings

3. Theological Implications
   - Salvation through knowledge rather than faith or works
   - Less emphasis on Jesus as savior, more as revealer of wisdom
   - No clear doctrine of sin or atonement

## Historical Value and Debates

1. Potential Early Date
   - Some scholars argue Thomas preserves early, independent Jesus traditions
   - Possible connection to hypothetical Q source

2. Relationship to Canonical Gospels
   - Debate on whether Thomas is dependent on or independent from Synoptics
   - Potential insight into development of early Christian thought

3. Gnostic Influences
   - Debate on whether Thomas is fully Gnostic or shows proto-Gnostic tendencies
   - Implications for understanding diversity in early Christianity

4. Relevance to Historical Jesus Research
   - Some scholars use Thomas in reconstructing Jesus' teachings
   - Others argue it's too late or too influenced by later theology
