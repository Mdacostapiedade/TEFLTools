## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

   **Tip**: Emphasize that the goal is academic understanding, not conversion. Encourage students to view the study as an opportunity to deepen their understanding of early Christianity.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty in relating ancient texts to contemporary Timorese context.
   **Tip**: Regularly ask students to draw parallels with local wisdom traditions or current issues. Invite guest speakers from local communities to share perspectives.

4. **Challenge**: Students may lack background knowledge in early Christian history.
   **Tip**: Provide brief historical overviews at the beginning of each lesson. Create a classroom timeline that students can refer to throughout the course.

5. **Challenge**: Engaging students in meaningful debate about the text's relevance.
   **Tip**: Before the debate, have students individually write reflections on how they see the text relating (or not relating) to their lives. Use these reflections to guide debate preparation.

   **Tip**: Establish clear ground rules for respectful discussion. Model how to use academic language when discussing religious texts critically.
