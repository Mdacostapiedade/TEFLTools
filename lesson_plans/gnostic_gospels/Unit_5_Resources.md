## The Secret Book of John (Apocryphon of John)

[Excerpt from the beginning of the text]

The teaching of the savior, and the revelation of the mysteries and the things hidden in silence, even these things which he taught John, his disciple.

And it happened one day, when John, the brother of James - who are the sons of Zebedee - had come up to the temple, that a Pharisee named Arimanios approached him and said to him, "Where is your master whom you followed?" And he said to him, "He has gone to the place from which he came." The Pharisee said to him, "With deception did this Nazarene deceive you (pl.), and he filled your ears with lies, and closed your hearts (and) turned you from the traditions of your fathers."

When I, John, heard these things I turned away from the temple to a desert place. And I grieved greatly in my heart, saying, "How then was the savior appointed, and why was he sent into the world by his Father, and who is his Father who sent him, and of what sort is that aeon to which we shall go? For what did he mean when he said to us, 'This aeon to which you will go is of the type of the imperishable aeon, but he did not teach us concerning that one, of what sort it is."

# Lecture Notes

## Overview of the Secret Book of John

- Also known as the Apocryphon of John
- Discovered as part of the Nag Hammadi library in 1945
- Exists in both long and short versions
- Presents a complex Gnostic creation myth and cosmology
- Attributed to John the Apostle, though likely written much later (2nd century CE)

## Key Elements of the Creation Myth

1. The Divine Realm (Pleroma)
   - Invisible Spirit (the highest god)
   - Barbelo (first thought of the Invisible Spirit)
   - Aeons (divine emanations)

2. The Fall of Sophia
   - Sophia's desire to create without her partner
   - Creation of the Demiurge (Yaldabaoth)

3. The Material World
   - Yaldabaoth's creation of the physical universe
   - Creation of humanity by the Archons

4. Salvation
   - The divine spark within humans
   - Knowledge (gnosis) as the path to salvation

## Key Figures and Concepts

1. Sophia
   - Meaning "wisdom" in Greek
   - Last of the divine Aeons
   - Her fall leads to the creation of the material world

2. Yaldabaoth
   - The Demiurge or "craftsman"
   - Ignorant creator god of the material world
   - Often equated with the God of the Old Testament

3. Archons
   - Rulers of the material world
   - Created by Yaldabaoth
   - Often seen as malevolent forces

4. Divine Spark

   - Awakened through gnosis (knowledge)

## Comparison with Genesis

   - Creation of the world and humanity
   - Presence of a creator god
   - Concept of a fall from grace

2. Differences
   - Multiple divine beings vs. one God
   - Material world as flawed creation vs. good creation

3. How does the Secret Book of John explain the existence of evil and suffering in the world? Compare this explanation to other religious or philosophical perspectives you're familiar with.

4. What role does knowledge (gnosis) play in the salvation narrative of the Secret Book of John? How does this compare to the role of faith in mainstream Christianity?

5. How might the idea of a "divine spark" within humans influence one's view of human nature and potential? How does this concept relate to Timorese beliefs about the soul or spirit?

6. In what ways does the portrayal of Sophia in the Secret Book of John differ from traditional depictions of wisdom in religious texts? What might this say about the text's view of femininity and the divine?

7. How does the Secret Book of John's explanation of the material world's creation relate to modern scientific theories about the origin of the universe? Can these perspectives be reconciled?
