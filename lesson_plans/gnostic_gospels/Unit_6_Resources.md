# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Modern Spiritual Text Excerpts

### Excerpt 1: From "The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle

"The joy of Being, which is the only true happiness, cannot come to you through any form, possession, achievement, person, or event – through anything that happens. That joy cannot come to you – ever. It emanates from the formless dimension within you, from consciousness itself and thus is one with who you are."

### Excerpt 2: From "A New Earth" by Eckhart Tolle

"The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it. Be aware of the thoughts you are thinking. Separate them from the situation, which is always neutral. It is as it is."

### Excerpt 3: From "The Celestine Prophecy" by James Redfield

"I don't think that anything happens by coincidence... No one is here by accident... Everyone who crosses our path has a message for us. Otherwise they would have taken another path, or left earlier or later. The fact that these people are here means that they are here for some reason."

### Excerpt 4: From "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho

"And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."
