Chapter 6 
The Son of Man 
The Savior's farewell discourse concludes with a warning and a 
commission. The warning is not to be deceived by those who would 
lead them astray by saying "Look over here!" or "Look over there!" 
The commission is to go forth and preach the good news about the 
Realm. The warning and commission are linked by the Savior's teach­
ing about the Son of Man: "For the child of true Humanity exists 
within you. Follow it! Those who search for it will find it" (GMary 
4:5-7). 
The phrase "Son of Man" appears frequently in the canonical 
gospels, where it is used almost exclusively as a self-designation by 
Jesus. The phrase has been the subject of much scholarly debate, but 
most scholars agree that it refers to Jesus' role as an eschatological 
judge and savior figure.1 In the Gospel of Mary, however, the phrase 
has an entirely different meaning. Here it refers not to Jesus, but to 
the true spiritual nature of humanity. The Coptic phrase, p¥hre 
mprwme, literally means "the Son of the Man" or "the child of the 
Human Being." I have translated it as "the child of true Humanity" 
in order to capture something of the non-gendered character of the 
Coptic, as well as to emphasize that it refers not to a single individual 
(Jesus), but to the spiritual nature common to all human beings. The 
59 
60 The Gospel of Mary of Magdala 
Savior's point is that people should not look for salvation to come 
from the outside, but should seek it by turning inward to discover 
their own true spiritual nature. 
The Savior's teaching about the Son of Man is the centerpiece of 
his farewell discourse. It ties together the teaching about the nature of 
sin and the body with the commission to go forth and preach. The 
Savior has just finished explaining that sin is produced when people act 
in accordance with their adulterated nature. Now he tells them that 
their true nature, the "child of true Humanity," exists within them. 
They are to follow it and seek for it. The implication is that by doing 
so, they will avoid sin and achieve salvation. 
The Savior's teaching about the Son of Man is also tied to the 
commission to preach the good news about the Realm. The disciples 
are told to go forth and preach, but they are not to lay down any rules 
beyond what the Savior has determined for them. The connection 
between the teaching about the Son of Man and the commission to 
preach is made explicit in the disciples' question after the Savior has 
departed: "How are we going to go out to the rest of the world to 
announce the good news about the Realm of the child of true 
Humanity?" (GMary 5:2-3). The content of their preaching is to be 
the Savior's teaching about the true spiritual nature within. 
The Savior's teaching about the Son of Man shows clear similari­
ties to the kind of Platonic thinking we have already seen. The true 
spiritual self (the child of true Humanity) exists within a person, but 
is separable from the body. It belongs to the Divine Realm and is the 
means by which a person can come to know God. In this case, how­
ever, the Divine Realm is not described as a world of eternal Forms or 
Ideas, but as the Realm of the child of true Humanity. 
The teaching about the Son of Man also shows similarities to Stoic 
thought. The true self is described as existing within a person, much 
as the Stoics conceived of the ruling part of the soul as existing within 
the body. Moreover, the Savior's admonition to "follow it" is reminis­
cent of the Stoic injunction to live in accordance with nature. For the 
Stoics, living in accordance with nature meant living in accordance 
with reason, which they identified as the ruling part of the soul. The 
Savior's teaching goes beyond this, however, in identifying the true 
self not merely with reason, but with the divine "child of true 
Humanity." 
The Savior's teaching about the Son of Man is the culmination of 
his teaching about matter, sin, and salvation. It ties together the vari-
The Son of Man 61 
ous strands of his teaching and provides the basis for the ethical life. 
The true self, the divine spark within, provides the means by which 
people can overcome the power of sin and achieve salvation. By turn­
ing inward and discovering their true nature, people can overcome the 
deceptive power of the body and its passions. They can achieve the 
peace and stability that comes from knowledge of the truth. And they 
can find within themselves the power to resist the domination of ille­
gitimate authorities, whether human or superhuman. 
The Savior's teaching about the Son of Man also provides the 
basis for the ethical life. The disciples are to go forth and preach the 
good news about the Realm of the child of true Humanity. They are 
not to lay down rules, but to proclaim the truth about human nature 
and its relation to God. The ethical life consists in living in accordance 
with one's true nature, not in following external rules and regulations. 
The Savior's teaching about the Son of Man is thus the key to 
understanding the Gospel of Mary's message about salvation. It pro­
vides the means by which people can overcome sin and achieve salva­
tion. It provides the basis for the ethical life. And it provides the 
content of the good news that the disciples are to proclaim to the 
world. 

Chapter 7 
Vision & Mind 
The Savior's teaching about the Son of Man is followed by his 
departure. The disciples are left alone, and they are afraid. They weep, 
fearing that if they go out to preach the gospel, they will suffer the 
same fate as the Savior. At this point, Mary steps forward to comfort 
them. She urges them not to weep or grieve or be irresolute, for the 
Savior's grace will protect them. Rather, she says, they should praise 
the Savior's greatness, "for he has prepared us and made us true 
Human beings" (GMary 5:9). 
Mary's words recall the Savior's teaching about the Son of Man. 
The Savior had told the disciples that the child of true Humanity exists 
within them; now Mary tells them that the Savior has made them into 
true Human beings. The implication is that through the Savior's 
teaching, the disciples have realized their true nature as spiritual 
beings. They have become what they truly are. 
Mary's words have a powerful effect on the disciples. We are told 
that "she turned their heart [to]ward the Good, and they began to 
discuss the words of the [Savior]" (GMary 5:9-10). Mary has suc­
ceeded where the Savior seemingly failed. The disciples are no longer 
afraid, but are engaged in discussing the Savior's teaching. 
63 
64 The Gospel of Mary of Magdala 
At this point, Peter turns to Mary and asks her to tell them the 
words of the Savior that she remembers, "the things which you know 
that we don't because we haven't heard them" (GMary 6:2). Peter 
acknowledges that the Savior loved Mary more than other women, 
and that she has special knowledge that the other disciples lack. Mary 
agrees to tell them what has been hidden from them. 
Mary's account of the Savior's teaching takes the form of a vision. 
She begins by saying, "I saw the Lord in a vision and I said to him, 
'Lord, I saw you today in a vision'" (GMary 7:1-2). The Savior 
responds by praising Mary for not wavering when she saw him. He 
then tells her, "For where the mind is, there is the treasure" (GMary 
7:4). 
This saying about the mind and the treasure is similar to a saying 
found in the Synoptic gospels: "For where your treasure is, there will 
your heart be also" (Matt 6:21//Luke 12:34). In the Synoptics, the 
saying is part of Jesus' teaching about the relative value of earthly and 
heavenly treasures. The Gospel of Mary, however, gives the saying a 
different twist. Here the emphasis is on the mind rather than the heart, 
and the implication is that true treasure is to be found through the 
exercise of the mind rather than through the accumulation of material 
goods. 
The Savior's statement about the mind and the treasure leads 
Mary to ask a question: "Lord, now does a person who sees a vision 
see it <with> the soul <or> with the spirit?" (GMary 7:5). The Savior 
responds: 
A person does not see with the soul or with the spirit. Rather 
the mind, which exists between these two, sees the vision 
an[d] that is w[hat...] (GMary 7:6-7). 
The text breaks off at this point, leaving us to wonder what else the 
Savior might have said about the nature of visions and the role of the 
mind in perceiving them. 
The discussion of visions and the mind is significant for several 
reasons. First, it shows that the Gospel of Mary is concerned with ques­
tions of epistemology—how we know what we know. The Savior's 
teaching about the Son of Man had emphasized the importance of 
turning inward to discover one's true nature. Now we see that this 
inward turn involves the exercise of the mind. The mind is the faculty 
by which one perceives visions and gains knowledge of spiritual reali­
ties. 
Vision & Mind 65 
Second, the discussion of visions and the mind shows that the 
Gospel of Mary is concerned with questions of authority. Mary's vision 
of the Savior gives her special knowledge that the other disciples lack. 
This knowledge gives her authority to teach and to comfort the other 
disciples. The fact that she has seen the Savior in a vision puts her on 
a par with the other disciples who have seen the risen Lord. 
Third, the discussion of visions and the mind shows that the 
Gospel of Mary is concerned with questions of interpretation. The 
Savior's teaching about the mind and visions suggests that visions are 
not to be taken at face value, but must be interpreted. The mind is the 
faculty by which one interprets visions and gains knowledge of spiri­
tual realities. 
The Gospel of Mary's emphasis on the mind as the faculty by which 
one perceives visions and gains knowledge of spiritual realities is sim­
ilar to ideas found in Platonic and Stoic philosophy. For Plato, the 
mind (nous) is the highest faculty of the soul, the part that is capable 
of perceiving the eternal Forms. For the Stoics, the mind (hegemonikon) 
is the ruling part of the soul, the part that is capable of reason and 
that should govern one's actions. The Gospel of Mary's emphasis on 
the mind as the faculty by which one perceives visions and gains 
knowledge of spiritual realities is thus in keeping with ideas that were 
widely current in the philosophical traditions of the ancient world. 
The Gospel of Mary's emphasis on the mind as the faculty by which 
one perceives visions and gains knowledge of spiritual realities is also 
similar to ideas found in other early Christian texts. The Gospel of 
Thomas, for example, emphasizes the importance of understanding 
Jesus' sayings: "Whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will 
not experience death" (GThom 1). The emphasis on interpretation 
suggests that the sayings are not to be taken at face value, but must be 
understood through the exercise of the mind. 
The Gospel of Mary's emphasis on the mind as the faculty by which 
one perceives visions and gains knowledge of spiritual realities is also 
similar to ideas found in later Gnostic texts. The Apocryphon of John, 
for example, describes the creation of the human being as involving 
the implantation of a divine spark within the material body. This 
divine spark is identified with the mind (nous) and is said to be the 
means by which human beings can come to know God. 
The Gospel of Mary's emphasis on the mind as the faculty by which 
one perceives visions and gains knowledge of spiritual realities is thus 
part of a broader trend in early Christianity toward emphasizing the 
66 The Gospel of Mary of Magdala 
importance of knowledge and understanding. This trend is often asso­
ciated with Gnosticism, but it is important to note that it is not lim­
ited to texts that are usually classified as Gnostic. The Gospel of Mary's 
emphasis on the mind as the faculty by which one perceives visions and 
gains knowledge of spiritual realities is thus part of a broader trend in 
early Christianity toward emphasizing the importance of knowledge 
and understanding. 
The Gospel of Mary's emphasis on the mind as the faculty by which 
one perceives visions and gains knowledge of spiritual realities is also 
significant for what it tells us about the text's view of human nature. 
The Savior's teaching about the Son of Man had emphasized that the 
true self is spiritual in nature. Now we see that
