## From Karen King's "The Gospel of Mary of Magdala"

### Chapter 6: The Son of Man

The Savior's farewell discourse concludes with a warning and a 
commission. The warning is not to be deceived by those who would 
lead them astray by saying "Look over here!" or "Look over there!" 
The commission is to go forth and preach the good news about the 
Realm. The warning and commission are linked by the Savior's teach­
ing about the Son of Man: "For the child of true Humanity exists 
within you. Follow it! Those who search for it will find it" (GMary 
4:5-7). 

The phrase "Son of Man" appears frequently in the canonical 
gospels, where it is used almost exclusively as a self-designation by 
Jesus. The phrase has been the subject of much scholarly debate, but 
most scholars agree that it refers to Jesus' role as an eschatological 
judge and savior figure. In the Gospel of Mary, however, the phrase 
has an entirely different meaning. Here it refers not to Jesus, but to 
the true spiritual nature of humanity. The Coptic phrase, p¥hre 
mprwme, literally means "the Son of the Man" or "the child of the 
Human Being." I have translated it as "the child of true Humanity" 
in order to capture something of the non-gendered character of the 
Coptic, as well as to emphasize that it refers not to a single individual 
(Jesus), but to the spiritual nature common to all human beings. The 
Savior's point is that people should not look for salvation to come 
from the outside, but should seek it by turning inward to discover 
their own true spiritual nature.

### Chapter 7: Vision & Mind

The Savior's teaching about the Son of Man is followed by his 
departure. The disciples are left alone, and they are afraid. They weep, 
fearing that if they go out to preach the gospel, they will suffer the 
same fate as the Savior. At this point, Mary steps forward to comfort 
them. She urges them not to weep or grieve or be irresolute, for the 
Savior's grace will protect them. Rather, she says, they should praise 
the Savior's greatness, "for he has prepared us and made us true 
Human beings" (GMary 5:9). 

Mary's words recall the Savior's teaching about the Son of Man. 
The Savior had told the disciples that the child of true Humanity exists 
within them; now Mary tells them that the Savior has made them into 
true Human beings. The implication is that through the Savior's 
teaching, the disciples have realized their true nature as spiritual 
beings. They have become what they truly are.

Mary's words have a powerful effect on the disciples. We are told 
that "she turned their heart [to]ward the Good, and they began to 
discuss the words of the [Savior]" (GMary 5:9-10). Mary has suc­
ceeded where the Savior seemingly failed. The disciples are no longer 
afraid, but are engaged in discussing the Savior's teaching.

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the Gospel of Mary's interpretation of the "Son of Man" differ from its use in canonical gospels? What implications does this have for understanding early Christian views on human nature?

2. Discuss the significance of Mary Magdalene's role in comforting and teaching the other disciples. How might this portrayal challenge traditional views of early church leadership?

3. Compare the Gospel of Mary's teachings on the nature of matter and sin with those found in canonical New Testament texts. What similarities and differences do you notice?

4. How does the emphasis on the mind as the faculty for spiritual perception relate to Platonic and Stoic philosophical ideas? What might this suggest about the intellectual context of the Gospel of Mary?

5. Analyze the conflict between Mary and the male disciples (Peter and Andrew) at the end of the text. What might this reveal about debates over spiritual authority in early Christianity?

# Writing Exercise

Write a 500-word essay comparing and contrasting the portrayal of Mary Magdalene in the Gospel of Mary with her depiction in one of the canonical gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John). Consider the following points:

- Her relationship with Jesus
- Her role among the disciples
- Her spiritual knowledge or authority
- The reaction of other disciples to her

Use specific examples from both texts to support your analysis. Conclude by reflecting on what these different portrayals might reveal about diverse perspectives in early Christianity.
