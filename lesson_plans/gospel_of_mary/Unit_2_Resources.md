## Gospel of Mary, Chapter 7

"Will matter then be destroyed or not?"
The Savior said, "All nature, all formations, all creatures exist in and with one another, and they will be resolved again into their own roots.
For the nature of matter is resolved into the roots of its own nature alone.
He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
Peter said to him, "Since you have explained everything to us, tell us this also: What is the sin of the world?"
The Savior said "There is no sin, but it is you who make sin when you do the things that are like the nature of adultery, which is called sin.
That is why the Good came into your midst, to the essence of every nature in order to restore it to its root."
Then He continued and said, "That is why you become sick and die, for you are deprived of the one who can heal you.
He who has a mind to understand, let him understand.
Matter gave birth to a passion that has no equal, which proceeded from something contrary to nature. Then there arises a disturbance in its whole body.
That is why I said to you, Be of good courage, and if you are discouraged be encouraged in the presence of the different forms of nature.
He who has ears to hear, let him hear."

## 3. The Role of Knowledge in Salvation

- Salvation through gnosis (spiritual knowledge)
- Importance of understanding one's divine nature
- The Savior as a revealer of truth rather than a sacrificial figure
- Knowledge as transformative and liberating
