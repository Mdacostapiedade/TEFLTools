### Worksheet 1: Analyzing Key Passages

Instructions: Read the following passages from the Gospel of Mary and answer the questions below.

1. "All natures, all formed things, all creatures exist in and with one another and will again be resolved into their own roots, because the nature of matter is dissolved into the roots of its nature alone." (7:1-5)

   Q: What does this passage suggest about the nature of matter and its relationship to the spiritual realm?

   Q: How does this view of sin differ from traditional Christian teachings?

3. "The Savior said, 'All natures, all formations, all creatures exist in and with one another and they will be resolved again into their own roots.'" (2:2-4)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with the unfamiliar concepts in Gnostic thought.
   **Solution**: Provide clear definitions and use analogies from Timorese culture to explain abstract ideas.

2. **Challenge**: Some students may feel uncomfortable with teachings that seem to contradict traditional Christian doctrine.
   **Solution**: Emphasize the historical context and encourage open-minded exploration of diverse early Christian views.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty in relating ancient texts to contemporary issues.
   **Solution**: Use guided discussions to help students draw parallels between ancient debates and current spiritual or social issues in Timor-Leste.

4. **Challenge**: Language barriers in understanding complex theological concepts.
   **Solution**: Use visual aids, simplify language where possible, and encourage peer explanations in Tetum.

5. **Challenge**: Lack of prior knowledge about early Christian history and diversity.
   **Solution**: Provide a brief historical overview at the beginning of the lesson and use a timeline to contextualize the Gospel of Mary.
