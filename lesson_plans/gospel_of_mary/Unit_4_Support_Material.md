## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to understand the historical context of early Christianity.
   **Solution**: Provide a brief timeline of early Christian development and key events to help students situate the Gospel of Mary and other texts.

2. **Challenge**: Some students may have strong personal beliefs that conflict with the ideas presented in the Gospel of Mary.
   **Solution**: Emphasize that the goal is to understand historical perspectives, not to challenge personal faith. Encourage respectful discussion of different viewpoints.

3. **Challenge**: Students may find it difficult to relate ancient debates to contemporary issues.
   **Solution**: Use the case study on Timorese churches to bridge the gap. Encourage students to draw parallels between early Christian debates and current discussions in their communities.

4. **Challenge**: The concept of visionary experiences may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable for some students.
   **Solution**: Provide examples of visionary experiences from various religious traditions, including Timorese spiritual practices, to help contextualize the concept.

5. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with the academic language used in some of the texts.
   **Solution**: Provide simplified explanations of key concepts and encourage students to paraphrase ideas in their own words. Use visual aids to illustrate complex relationships between ideas.
