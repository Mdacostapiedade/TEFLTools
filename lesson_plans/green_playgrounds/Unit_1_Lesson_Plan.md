# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Climate Change Impacts in Timor-Leste's Urban Areas

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer
- Large map of Timor-Leste
- Colored markers/pins
- Handouts with climate change data for Timor-Leste
- Flip charts and markers for group work

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe key climate change projections for Timor-Leste
- Identify major climate change impacts on urban areas in Timor-Leste
- Analyze vulnerabilities in Timorese cities due to climate change

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show images of recent flooding, landslides, or drought impacts in Timorese cities
- Ask students to share any personal experiences or observations of climate change impacts in their communities

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Climate change projection
- Urban heat island effect
- Sea level rise
- Extreme weather events
- Climate vulnerability

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of climate change projections for Timor-Leste:
  * Temperature increases
  * Changes in precipitation patterns
  * Sea level rise projections
- Explanation of urban heat island effect and its amplification of climate impacts
- Discussion of increased flooding and landslide risks in urban areas
- Overview of impacts on water resources and urban infrastructure

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- In small groups, students analyze climate data handouts and create a summary of key projections for Timor-Leste
- Groups present their findings to the class

## 7. Production Task (40 minutes)

- Divide class into teams representing different Timorese cities
- Each team uses the large map to identify and mark climate vulnerabilities in their assigned city
- Teams present their vulnerability maps to the class, explaining their reasoning

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Facilitate a whole-class discussion on common vulnerabilities identified across cities
- Summarize key points about climate change impacts on Timorese urban areas
- Preview next lesson on green infrastructure solutions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students write a 1-page reflection on climate change impacts they've observed in their own community
- Students research and bring an example of a climate adaptation measure implemented in a Timorese city

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Climate change projection: A prediction of future climate conditions based on scientific models
- Urban heat island effect: The phenomenon where urban areas are significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas due to human activities and infrastructure
- Sea level rise: The increase in the level of the world's oceans due to global warming
- Extreme weather events: Unusual, severe or unseasonal weather events, often linked to climate change
- Climate vulnerability: The degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change
