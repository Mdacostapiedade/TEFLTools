# Lecture Notes

## Climate Change Projections for Timor-Leste

### Temperature Increases
- Mean annual temperature projected to increase by 0.8°C to 1.6°C by 2050
- Larger increases expected in inland mountainous regions
- More frequent extreme heat days (over 35°C) in urban areas

### Precipitation Changes
- Annual rainfall projected to increase slightly (0-4%)
- More intense rainfall events during wet season
- Longer and more severe dry seasons
- Increased variability in rainfall patterns

### Sea Level Rise
- Projected rise of 0.18-0.59m by 2100
- Higher storm surges and coastal flooding
- Saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers

## Urban Heat Island Effect

- Definition: phenomenon where urban areas are significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas
- Causes in Timorese cities:
  * Dark surfaces (asphalt, concrete) absorbing heat
  * Lack of vegetation and green spaces
  * Heat-generating activities (traffic, air conditioning)
- Amplification of climate change impacts:
  * Increased energy consumption for cooling
  * Higher heat-related health risks
  * Exacerbation of air pollution

## Flooding and Landslide Risks

### Urban Flooding
- Increased frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events
- Inadequate drainage systems in many Timorese cities
- Rapid urbanization reducing permeable surfaces
- Key risk areas: low-lying coastal zones, areas near rivers

### Landslides
- More common in hilly urban areas during intense rainfall
- Exacerbated by deforestation and unplanned construction
- Threats to informal settlements on steep slopes

## Impacts on Water Resources and Infrastructure

### Water Resources
- Stress on urban water supply systems during prolonged dry seasons
- Contamination of water sources during flood events
- Saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers

### Infrastructure
- Damage to roads and bridges from flooding and landslides
- Stress on drainage and sewage systems during extreme rainfall
- Impacts on electricity distribution during storms
- Challenges for solid waste management in flood-prone areas

# Discussion Questions

1. How might the projected temperature increases affect daily life and economic activities in Timorese cities?

2. What are some potential cascading effects of more intense rainfall events on urban infrastructure and public health?

3. How could the urban heat island effect interact with climate change to create unique challenges for Timorese cities?

4. What are some specific vulnerabilities of informal settlements in Timorese cities to climate change impacts?

5. How might sea level rise affect coastal cities in Timor-Leste beyond just flooding? Consider economic and social impacts.

6. What are some traditional or local practices in Timor-Leste that might help address some of these climate change impacts?

7. How could climate change impacts on urban areas affect rural-urban migration patterns in Timor-Leste?

8. What are some potential conflicts that might arise between climate adaptation measures and urban development goals?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Imagine you are a city planner in Dili, Timor-Leste. Based on the climate change projections we've discussed, what do you see as the three most critical challenges facing the city in the next 30 years? For each challenge, propose one concrete action the city could take to address it."

Your essay should:
- Clearly identify and explain the three challenges
- Demonstrate understanding of Dili's specific context
- Propose realistic and specific actions
- Consider potential obstacles or limitations to these actions
- Use evidence from the lecture to support your points

# Assignment Details

## Climate Vulnerability Mapping Exercise

1. Form groups of 3-4 students
2. Each group will be assigned one of the following Timorese cities:
   - Dili
   - Baucau
   - Maliana
   - Suai
   - Lospalos

3. Using the provided large map of Timor-Leste, identify and mark climate vulnerabilities in your assigned city. Consider:
   - Flood-prone areas
   - Landslide risk zones
   - Areas vulnerable to sea level rise
   - Urban heat island hotspots
   - Critical infrastructure at risk

4. Use colored pins or markers to indicate different types of vulnerabilities

5. Prepare a 5-minute presentation explaining your vulnerability map to the class. Include:
   - Key vulnerabilities identified
   - Reasoning behind your choices
   - Potential impacts on the city and its residents

6. Be prepared to answer questions from classmates and the instructor about your analysis

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: 2021 Dili Floods

On April 4, 2021, Cyclone Seroja caused severe flooding in Dili and surrounding areas. Key impacts included:

- Over 45 deaths and 10,000 people displaced
- Damage to critical infrastructure including roads, bridges, and the airport
- Contamination of water sources leading to disease outbreaks
- Disruption of COVID-19 containment efforts

This event highlighted Dili's vulnerability to extreme weather events and the cascading impacts on urban systems. It also demonstrated the need for improved urban planning, early warning systems, and climate-resilient infrastructure.

## Relevant Local Organizations

- Seeds of Life (SoL): Research program on climate-resilient crops
- Permatil: Permaculture organization promoting sustainable land use
- Haburas Foundation: Environmental NGO working on climate change awareness
- HASATIL: Network of NGOs focused on sustainable agriculture and food security

These organizations could be potential partners for guest lectures, field trips, or student projects.

## Key Data Sources

- Timor-Leste's National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) on Climate Change
- UNDP Climate Change Country Profile for Timor-Leste
- World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal - Timor-Leste
- Pacific Climate Change Science Program reports

Students should be encouraged to use these sources for their assignments and further research.
