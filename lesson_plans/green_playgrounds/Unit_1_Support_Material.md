Here's the support material for the lesson plan, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for "Introduction to Climate Change Impacts in Timor-Leste's Urban Areas"

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Climate change projection**: A prediction of future climate conditions based on scientific models
- **Urban heat island effect**: The phenomenon where urban areas are significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas due to human activities and infrastructure
- **Sea level rise**: The increase in the level of the world's oceans due to global warming
- **Extreme weather events**: Unusual, severe or unseasonal weather events, often linked to climate change
- **Climate vulnerability**: The degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change
- **Adaptation**: Adjusting to actual or expected climate change and its effects
- **Mitigation**: Efforts to reduce or prevent emission of greenhouse gases
- **Resilience**: The ability to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to hazardous events related to climate change

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Climate Change Projections Map**: A map of Timor-Leste showing projected temperature increases and precipitation changes across different regions.

2. **Urban Heat Island Effect Diagram**: An illustration comparing temperature differences between urban and rural areas, highlighting factors contributing to the effect.

3. **Sea Level Rise Impact Visualization**: A before-and-after image of a coastal area in Timor-Leste, showing potential inundation due to sea level rise.

4. **Climate Vulnerability Factors Infographic**: A visual representation of various factors contributing to climate vulnerability in Timorese cities.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Climate Data Analysis Worksheet**: 
   - Contains tables of climate data for Timor-Leste, including historical averages and future projections
   - Questions prompting students to calculate changes and identify trends
   - Space for students to summarize key findings

2. **Urban Climate Vulnerability Assessment Checklist**:
   - List of factors to consider when assessing climate vulnerability (e.g., proximity to coast, infrastructure quality, socioeconomic factors)
   - Rating scale for each factor
   - Space for notes and overall vulnerability score

3. **Personal Climate Change Observations Log**:
   - Template for students to record observed changes in their local environment
   - Prompts for different categories (temperature, rainfall, extreme events, etc.)
   - Reflection questions on the impact of these changes

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Timor-Leste's National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) on Climate Change
2. UNDP Climate Change Country Profile for Timor-Leste
3. World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal - Timor-Leste
4. Asian Development Bank's "A Region at Risk: The Human Dimensions of Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific"
5. IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Cities

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have varying levels of prior knowledge about climate change.
   **Solution**: Begin with a brief assessment of existing knowledge and adjust the lesson accordingly. Provide additional background reading for students who need it.

2. **Challenge**: Some students may be skeptical about climate change.
   **Solution**: Focus on local, observable changes and scientific data. Encourage critical thinking and open discussion of evidence.

3. **Challenge**: The topic may feel overwhelming or depressing to some students.
   **Solution**: Balance discussion of impacts with information on solutions and adaptation strategies. Emphasize the role of individual and community action.

4. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to relate global climate projections to local impacts.
   **Solution**: Use local case studies and encourage students to share personal observations. Conduct field trips to observe local climate impacts if possible.

5. **Challenge**: Limited availability of Timor-Leste-specific climate data.
   **Solution**: Supplement with regional data and emphasize the importance of local research and data collection. Encourage students to contribute to citizen science initiatives.

6. **Challenge**: Language barriers in understanding scientific terms.
   **Solution**: Provide vocabulary lists in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and simple analogies to explain complex concepts.
