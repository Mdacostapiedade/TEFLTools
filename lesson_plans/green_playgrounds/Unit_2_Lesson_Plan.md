# Lesson Plan: Green Infrastructure Principles and Practices

## 1. Resources Needed

- Textbook: "Green Infrastructure: Principles and Applications for Urban Climate Resilience"
- PowerPoint presentation on green infrastructure practices
- Handouts with diagrams of various green infrastructure elements
- Materials for rain garden design activity: graph paper, colored pencils, plant guides
- Transportation for field trip

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define green infrastructure and explain its key functions
- Identify at least 5 green infrastructure practices suitable for Timor-Leste
- Describe how green infrastructure practices can be adapted to Timor-Leste's climate and urban contexts
- Design a basic rain garden appropriate for a local setting

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Think-Pair-Share: 
- Ask students to think about traditional ways people in Timor-Leste have managed water in their communities.
- Have them pair up and share their ideas.
- Discuss as a class, highlighting connections to modern green infrastructure concepts.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Green infrastructure
- Bioswale
- Rain garden
- Permeable paving
- Green roof
- Infiltration
- Evapotranspiration

Use visual aids and local examples where possible.

## 5. Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

PowerPoint presentation covering:
- Definition and benefits of green infrastructure
- Overview of common green infrastructure practices
- Adapting practices to Timor-Leste's climate and urban contexts
- Case studies from Southeast Asian cities

Include plenty of visuals and encourage student questions throughout.

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Green Infrastructure Identification:
   - Show photos of various urban scenes in Timor-Leste
   - Students identify potential locations for green infrastructure and suggest appropriate practices

2. Adaptation Brainstorm:
   - In small groups, students discuss how to adapt a specific green infrastructure practice (e.g., green roofs) to Timor-Leste's climate and context
   - Groups share their ideas with the class

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

Rain Garden Design Activity:
- Divide class into small groups
- Provide a scenario of a local school with drainage issues
- Groups design a rain garden, including:
  * Layout and dimensions
  * Plant selection (using provided guides)
  * Explanation of how it will function

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key concepts covered
- Address any remaining questions
- Preview the upcoming field trip

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a one-page report on a green infrastructure project from another Southeast Asian country, analyzing how it could be applied in Timor-Leste.

2. Prepare 3 questions to ask during the field trip to existing green infrastructure sites in Dili.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Green infrastructure: An approach to water management that protects, restores, or mimics the natural water cycle, often incorporating both natural and engineered systems.

- Bioswale: A vegetated, shallow, landscaped depression designed to capture, treat, and infiltrate stormwater runoff.

- Rain garden: A planted depression that allows rainwater runoff from impervious urban areas to be absorbed.

- Permeable paving: A porous urban surface which allows rainwater to infiltrate through to the soil below.

- Green roof: A roof of a building that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane.

- Infiltration: The process by which water on the ground surface enters the soil.

- Evapotranspiration: The process by which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and other surfaces and by transpiration from plants.
