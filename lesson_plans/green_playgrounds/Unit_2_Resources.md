## Definition and Benefits of Green Infrastructure

### What is Green Infrastructure?
- An approach to water management that protects, restores, or mimics the natural water cycle
- Incorporates both natural and engineered systems
- Focuses on managing rainwater where it falls

### Key Benefits:
1. Stormwater Management
   - Reduces runoff volume
   - Improves water quality
   - Alleviates pressure on traditional drainage systems

2. Climate Resilience
   - Mitigates urban heat island effect
   - Reduces flood risk
   - Enhances drought resilience

3. Environmental Benefits
   - Improves air quality
   - Increases biodiversity
   - Reduces carbon footprint

4. Social and Economic Benefits
   - Creates green spaces for recreation
   - Improves public health
   - Enhances property values
   - Creates green jobs

## Overview of Green Infrastructure Practices

### Bioswales
- Definition: Vegetated, shallow, landscaped depressions
- Function: Capture, treat, and infiltrate stormwater runoff
- Key features:
  * Sloped sides
  * Native vegetation
  * Engineered soil mix

### Rain Gardens
- Definition: Planted depressions that collect rainwater runoff
- Function: Absorb and filter stormwater
- Key features:
  * Native plants
  * Ponding area
  * Mulch layer

### Permeable Paving
- Definition: Porous urban surfaces allowing rainwater infiltration
- Types:
  * Pervious concrete
  * Porous asphalt
  * Permeable interlocking pavers
- Benefits:
  * Reduces runoff
  * Recharges groundwater

### Green Roofs
- Definition: Building roofs partially or fully covered with vegetation
- Types:
  * Extensive (shallow, low maintenance)
  * Intensive (deeper, more diverse plantings)
- Benefits:
  * Reduces runoff
  * Insulates buildings
  * Mitigates urban heat island effect

### Urban Tree Canopy
- Definition: Trees planted in urban areas
- Benefits:
  * Intercepts rainfall
  * Provides shade
  * Improves air quality

## Adapting Practices to Timor-Leste's Climate and Urban Contexts

### Climate Considerations
- Tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons
- High intensity rainfall events
- Risk of extended dry periods

### Adaptation Strategies
1. Plant Selection
   - Use native, drought-resistant species
   - Select plants that can withstand both heavy rain and dry periods

2. Soil Composition
   - Incorporate organic matter to improve water retention
   - Use local materials when possible

3. Sizing and Design
   - Design for high-intensity rainfall events
   - Incorporate overflow mechanisms

4. Maintenance Considerations
   - Develop low-maintenance designs
   - Plan for regular upkeep during dry seasons

5. Integration with Traditional Practices
   - Incorporate traditional water management techniques
   - Blend modern designs with cultural aesthetics

# Discussion Questions

1. How does green infrastructure differ from traditional "gray" infrastructure in managing stormwater?

2. What are the potential challenges in implementing green infrastructure in Timor-Leste's urban areas? How might these be overcome?

3. How can green infrastructure projects be designed to provide multiple benefits beyond just stormwater management?

4. In what ways can traditional Timorese water management practices inform modern green infrastructure design?

5. How might climate change impact the effectiveness of green infrastructure in Timor-Leste, and how can designs be adapted to address this?

6. What role can community engagement play in the success of green infrastructure projects in Timor-Leste?

7. How can green infrastructure be integrated with urban agriculture initiatives in Timor-Leste?

8. What policy measures could be implemented to encourage the adoption of green infrastructure in Timorese cities?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Green Infrastructure Adaptation Essay

Write a 500-word essay on how a specific green infrastructure practice (e.g., rain gardens, bioswales, or green roofs) could be adapted for use in Timor-Leste. Consider the following points:

1. Brief description of the chosen green infrastructure practice
2. Specific climate and urban challenges in Timor-Leste that the practice could address
3. Necessary adaptations to make the practice suitable for Timor-Leste's context
4. Potential benefits of implementing this practice in Timorese cities
5. Possible challenges in implementation and how they might be overcome

Your essay should demonstrate a clear understanding of both the green infrastructure practice and Timor-Leste's unique context. Use specific examples and cite relevant sources where appropriate.

# Assignment Details

## Rain Garden Design Project

### Objective
Design a rain garden for a local school in Dili, Timor-Leste.

### Context
The school experiences flooding during heavy rain events, and the administration wants to implement a green infrastructure solution that can also serve as an educational tool for students.

### Requirements
1. Site Analysis
   - Conduct a basic site analysis of the provided school layout
   - Identify potential locations for the rain garden

2. Design Elements
   - Create a detailed design of the rain garden, including:
     * Dimensions and shape
     * Soil composition
     * Plant selection (minimum 5 species, with justification)
     * Inlet and outlet structures

3. Functionality Explanation
   - Explain how the rain garden will function to manage stormwater
   - Calculate the approximate water storage capacity

4. Educational Component
   - Propose ideas for using the rain garden as an educational tool for students

5. Maintenance Plan
   - Develop a basic maintenance plan for the rain garden

### Deliverables
1. A scaled drawing of the rain garden design (hand-drawn or digital)
2. A plant list with descriptions and justifications
3. A 2-page report explaining the design choices, functionality, and maintenance plan
4. A brief presentation (5 minutes) to share your design with the class

### Evaluation Criteria
- Appropriateness of design for Timor-Leste's climate and context
- Creativity and innovation in design
- Thoroughness of explanation and justification
- Feasibility of implementation and maintenance
- Quality of presentation and visual materials
