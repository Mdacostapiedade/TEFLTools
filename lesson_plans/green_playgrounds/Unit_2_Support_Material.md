Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Green Infrastructure Principles and Practices, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Green Infrastructure Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Green infrastructure**: An approach to water management that protects, restores, or mimics the natural water cycle, often incorporating both natural and engineered systems.
- **Bioswale**: A vegetated, shallow, landscaped depression designed to capture, treat, and infiltrate stormwater runoff.
- **Rain garden**: A planted depression that allows rainwater runoff from impervious urban areas to be absorbed.
- **Permeable paving**: A porous urban surface which allows rainwater to infiltrate through to the soil below.
- **Green roof**: A roof of a building that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane.
- **Infiltration**: The process by which water on the ground surface enters the soil.
- **Evapotranspiration**: The process by which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and other surfaces and by transpiration from plants.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. Diagram: "Components of a Rain Garden"
   - Cross-section view showing layers: mulch, soil mix, gravel, native plants
   - Arrows indicating water flow and infiltration

2. Infographic: "Benefits of Green Infrastructure"
   - Icons representing: flood reduction, water quality improvement, urban heat mitigation, biodiversity support, community well-being

3. Comparison chart: "Traditional vs. Green Infrastructure Approaches"
   - Two columns showing differences in stormwater management techniques

4. Map: "Potential Green Infrastructure Sites in Dili"
   - Simplified city map with highlighted areas suitable for different GI practices

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. "Green Infrastructure Identification Worksheet"
   - Series of urban scene photos from Timor-Leste
   - Space for students to identify potential GI locations and suggest practices
   - Prompts for considering local context and climate

2. "Rain Garden Design Template"
   - Graph paper with scale noted
   - List of native plants suitable for rain gardens in Timor-Leste
   - Checklist of design considerations (size, slope, overflow, etc.)

3. "Adapting Green Infrastructure Practices Worksheet"
   - Table with columns: GI Practice, Traditional Design, Adaptations for Timor-Leste
   - Prompts for considering climate, materials, and cultural factors

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Green Infrastructure for Climate Adaptation: Lessons from Southeast Asian Cities" - ASEAN report
2. "Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems: A Southeast Asian Perspective" - journal article
3. Online course: "Designing Green Infrastructure for Tropical Climates" - edX
4. Video series: "Traditional Water Management Practices in Timor-Leste" - local NGO production
5. Website: Green Infrastructure Resource Portal for Southeast Asia

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited exposure to green infrastructure concepts.
   **Solution**: Begin with familiar local examples of water management, then bridge to modern GI practices.

2. **Challenge**: Lack of local case studies in Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Use examples from similar climates in Southeast Asia, and encourage students to envision applications in their own communities.

3. **Challenge**: Limited resources for hands-on activities.
   **Solution**: Utilize virtual design tools or simple materials like cardboard and clay for modeling GI practices.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in visualizing long-term benefits of GI.
   **Solution**: Use before-and-after photos of successful projects and time-lapse videos showing GI development.

5. **Challenge**: Connecting GI concepts to local urban planning challenges.
   **Solution**: Invite guest speakers from local government or NGOs to discuss real-world applications and challenges.
