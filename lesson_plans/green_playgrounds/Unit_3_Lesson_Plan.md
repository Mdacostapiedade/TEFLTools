# Lesson Plan: Stormwater Management through Green Infrastructure

## 1. Resources Needed

- Textbook: "Green Infrastructure: Principles and Applications for Urban Climate Resilience"
- Handouts on urban hydrology and stormwater runoff calculations
- Computer lab with GIS software
- Local maps and aerial imagery of a Timorese neighborhood
- Calculators
- Whiteboard and markers

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the challenges of urban stormwater management in Timor-Leste
- Define and apply Low Impact Development principles
- Identify appropriate green infrastructure techniques for stormwater management
- Calculate runoff reduction from a green infrastructure project
- Develop a basic stormwater management plan for a neighborhood

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Show a series of images depicting urban flooding in Timorese cities. Ask students to discuss in pairs:
- What are the causes of this flooding?
- What impacts does it have on the community?
- How might we address this issue?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and define key terms:
- Urban hydrology
- Stormwater runoff
- Impervious surfaces
- Low Impact Development (LID)
- Green infrastructure
- Infiltration
- Detention
- Retention

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Urban Hydrology and Stormwater Runoff Issues
- Explain the urban water cycle
- Discuss how urbanization affects natural hydrology
- Present common stormwater management challenges in Timorese cities

### Low Impact Development Principles
- Define LID and its goals
- Explain key LID principles: 
  - Preserve natural features
  - Minimize impervious surfaces
  - Slow and infiltrate runoff
  - Treat stormwater at the source

### Green Infrastructure for Stormwater Management
- Present overview of green infrastructure techniques:
  - Bioswales
  - Rain gardens
  - Permeable paving
  - Green roofs
  - Rainwater harvesting
- Discuss benefits for both stormwater quantity and quality control

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Activity 1: Runoff Reduction Calculation
Provide students with data on a hypothetical green infrastructure project (e.g., converting a parking lot to permeable paving). Guide them through the process of calculating the reduction in stormwater runoff using simple formulas.

### Activity 2: Identifying GI Opportunities
Using local maps and aerial imagery, have students work in small groups to identify potential locations for green infrastructure in a Timorese neighborhood. Ask them to justify their choices.

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

### Developing a Neighborhood Stormwater Management Plan
In groups, students will:
1. Analyze a given neighborhood's current stormwater management issues
2. Propose a set of green infrastructure interventions
3. Estimate the potential runoff reduction
4. Create a simple map showing proposed interventions
5. Prepare a brief presentation of their plan

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Groups present their stormwater management plans
- Class discussion on the strengths and challenges of each plan
- Recap key points of the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will research a successful green infrastructure project from another tropical country and write a 1-page summary addressing:
- The stormwater management challenge it addressed
- The green infrastructure techniques used
- The outcomes and benefits of the project
- How a similar approach could be applied in Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Urban hydrology: The study of water movement, distribution, and quality in urban areas
- Stormwater runoff: Rainfall that flows over land surfaces, often picking up pollutants
- Impervious surfaces: Areas that don't allow water to penetrate, like roads and rooftops
- Low Impact Development (LID): An approach to land development that works with nature to manage stormwater as close to its source as possible
- Green infrastructure: Natural and engineered ecological systems that provide environmental services in urban settings
- Infiltration: The process by which water on the ground surface enters the soil
- Detention: Temporary storage of stormwater to reduce peak discharge rates
- Retention: Long-term storage of stormwater, often involving infiltration or evaporation
