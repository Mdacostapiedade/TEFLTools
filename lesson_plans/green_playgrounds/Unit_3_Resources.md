# Lecture Notes

## Urban Hydrology and Stormwater Runoff Issues

### The Urban Water Cycle
- Natural water cycle: precipitation, infiltration, evapotranspiration, runoff
- Urban modifications:
  - Increased impervious surfaces
  - Reduced vegetation
  - Altered drainage patterns

### Impacts of Urbanization on Hydrology
- Increased runoff volume and peak flow rates
- Reduced groundwater recharge
- Decreased water quality due to pollutants
- Erosion and sedimentation

### Stormwater Management Challenges in Timorese Cities
- Rapid urbanization and informal settlements
- Limited existing stormwater infrastructure
- Tropical climate with intense rainfall events
- Topography: steep slopes in many urban areas
- Sea level rise and coastal flooding risks

## Low Impact Development Principles

### Definition and Goals of LID
- Approach to land development that works with nature
- Aims to maintain pre-development hydrology
- Manages stormwater at the source

### Key LID Principles
1. Preserve natural features and processes
   - Protect existing vegetation and soil
   - Maintain natural drainage patterns
2. Minimize impervious surfaces
   - Use permeable materials where possible
   - Reduce road widths and parking areas
3. Slow and infiltrate runoff
   - Increase time of concentration
   - Promote infiltration and evapotranspiration
4. Treat stormwater at the source
   - Distributed, small-scale practices
   - Mimic natural processes

## Green Infrastructure for Stormwater Management

### Overview of Green Infrastructure Techniques

#### Bioswales
- Vegetated channels that convey and treat stormwater
- Design considerations for Timor-Leste:
  - Use of native, drought-tolerant plants
  - Erosion control on steep slopes

#### Rain Gardens
- Shallow depressions with plants to capture and filter runoff
- Adaptation for Timorese context:
  - Selection of plants that can withstand both dry periods and intense rainfall
  - Integration with traditional gardening practices

#### Permeable Paving
- Allows water to pass through and infiltrate
- Types: porous asphalt, pervious concrete, interlocking pavers
- Considerations for Timor-Leste:
  - Durability in tropical climate
  - Maintenance requirements

#### Green Roofs
- Vegetated roof systems that reduce runoff and provide insulation
- Potential in Timor-Leste:
  - Cooling benefits in urban areas
  - Integration with rooftop agriculture

#### Rainwater Harvesting
- Collection and storage of rainwater for later use
- Relevance to Timor-Leste:
  - Water scarcity during dry season
  - Potential for community-scale systems

### Benefits for Stormwater Quantity and Quality Control
- Quantity:
  - Reduced peak flows
  - Decreased total runoff volume
  - Increased groundwater recharge
- Quality:
  - Filtration of pollutants
  - Sedimentation and settling
  - Biological uptake by plants

# Discussion Questions

1. How do the stormwater management challenges in Timorese cities differ from those in other countries you're familiar with? What unique solutions might be needed?

2. Discuss the potential cultural or social barriers to implementing LID principles in Timor-Leste. How might these be addressed?

3. Which green infrastructure techniques do you think would be most effective and feasible in Timorese cities? Why?

4. How can traditional Timorese water management practices be integrated with modern green infrastructure approaches?

5. What role can community engagement play in the success of green infrastructure projects for stormwater management?

6. How might climate change impact the effectiveness of green infrastructure in Timor-Leste over time? How can we design for future conditions?

7. Discuss the potential co-benefits of green infrastructure beyond stormwater management (e.g., urban heat island mitigation, biodiversity, public health). How can these be maximized in project design?

8. What are the main challenges in calculating runoff reduction from green infrastructure projects in Timor-Leste? How can we address data limitations?

9. How can green infrastructure be integrated into existing urban areas with limited space? Brainstorm creative solutions.

10. Discuss the potential economic benefits and challenges of implementing green infrastructure for stormwater management in Timorese cities.

## Runoff Reduction Calculation Example

### Scenario
Converting a 1000m² asphalt parking lot to permeable paving

### Given Data
- Annual rainfall: 1500mm
- Runoff coefficient for asphalt: 0.95
- Runoff coefficient for permeable paving: 0.35

### Calculation
1. Annual runoff from asphalt:
   1000m² × 1.5m × 0.95 = 1425m³

2. Annual runoff from permeable paving:
   1000m² × 1.5m × 0.35 = 525m³

3. Annual runoff reduction:
   1425m³ - 525m³ = 900m³

### Interpretation
The permeable paving reduces annual runoff by 900m³, or approximately 63%.
