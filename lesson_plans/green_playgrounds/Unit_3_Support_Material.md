Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Stormwater Management through Green Infrastructure, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Stormwater Management Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Urban hydrology: The study of water movement, distribution, and quality in urban areas
- Stormwater runoff: Rainfall that flows over land surfaces, often picking up pollutants
- Impervious surfaces: Areas that don't allow water to penetrate, like roads and rooftops
- Low Impact Development (LID): An approach to land development that works with nature to manage stormwater as close to its source as possible
- Green infrastructure: Natural and engineered ecological systems that provide environmental services in urban settings
- Infiltration: The process by which water on the ground surface enters the soil
- Detention: Temporary storage of stormwater to reduce peak discharge rates
- Retention: Long-term storage of stormwater, often involving infiltration or evaporation
- Bioswale: A vegetated channel designed to convey and filter stormwater runoff
- Rain garden: A shallow depression planted with native species to capture and filter runoff
- Permeable paving: Porous surfaces that allow water to pass through into the ground below
- Green roof: A roof partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. Urban Water Cycle Diagram:
   - Illustrate the natural water cycle alongside the urban water cycle
   - Highlight differences in infiltration, runoff, and evaporation rates
   - Show how impervious surfaces alter the natural flow of water

2. Green Infrastructure Techniques Infographic:
   - Visual representations of bioswales, rain gardens, permeable paving, green roofs, and rainwater harvesting
   - Brief descriptions and key benefits of each technique

3. Before and After Visualization:
   - Side-by-side images of a typical urban street before and after green infrastructure implementation
   - Highlight reduced flooding, increased vegetation, and improved aesthetics

4. Runoff Reduction Calculation Flowchart:
   - Step-by-step visual guide for calculating runoff reduction from a green infrastructure project

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. Urban Hydrology Basics Handout:
   - Key components of the urban water cycle
   - Factors affecting urban runoff
   - Simple formulas for calculating runoff volumes

2. Green Infrastructure Technique Comparison Table:
   - Columns: Technique, Description, Benefits, Challenges, Maintenance Requirements
   - Rows for each major green infrastructure type

3. Neighborhood Stormwater Management Plan Worksheet:
   - Section for analyzing current issues
   - Table for proposed interventions with columns for type, location, and estimated impact
   - Space for a simple map sketch
   - Guiding questions for plan presentation

4. Runoff Reduction Calculation Practice Sheet:
   - Step-by-step guide for calculations
   - Practice problems with varying scenarios
   - Space for showing work and final answers

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems: Design Manual for Timor-Leste" (hypothetical resource)
2. World Bank Report: "Green Infrastructure Finance: Framework Report"
3. EPA Green Infrastructure Website: https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure
4. Journal Article: "Green Infrastructure for Climate Resilience in Southeast Asian Cities"
5. Online Course: "Green Infrastructure Design for Urban Stormwater Management" on Coursera

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with runoff calculations
   - Tip: Provide step-by-step examples and encourage peer tutoring

2. Challenge: Limited local examples of green infrastructure
   - Tip: Use virtual tours and case studies from similar climates in Southeast Asia

3. Challenge: Difficulty in visualizing green infrastructure interventions
   - Tip: Use before-and-after photos, 3D renderings, or simple sketching exercises

4. Challenge: Connecting theory to local context
   - Tip: Invite local experts or government officials as guest speakers

5. Challenge: Varying levels of GIS proficiency among students
   - Tip: Pair students with different skill levels and provide additional resources for self-paced learning

6. Challenge: Misconceptions about green infrastructure effectiveness
   - Tip: Present data-driven case studies and encourage critical analysis of both benefits and limitations
