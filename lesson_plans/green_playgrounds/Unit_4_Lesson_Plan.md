# Lesson Plan: Designing Resilient Urban Parks and Public Spaces

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer
- Whiteboard and markers
- Printed maps of local urban parks
- Design software (AutoCAD or SketchUp) on student computers
- Handouts on green infrastructure techniques
- Plant and materials samples for demonstration

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Apply green infrastructure principles to urban park design
- Evaluate the multi-functional benefits of green spaces
- Create a redesign plan for an existing urban park incorporating green infrastructure

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show images of urban parks before and after green infrastructure implementation
- Ask students to identify differences and discuss potential benefits

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and define key terms:
- Bioswale
- Rain garden
- Permeable paving
- Urban heat island effect
- Ecosystem services

## 5. Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Integrating Stormwater Management into Park Design
- Discuss techniques for capturing and filtering stormwater runoff
- Present case studies of parks with integrated stormwater management

### Creating Cool Urban Spaces
- Explain strategies for mitigating urban heat island effect
- Discuss the role of vegetation and water features in cooling

### Designing for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services
- Introduce concept of ecosystem services in urban environments
- Discuss plant selection for biodiversity and habitat creation

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- In small groups, students analyze maps of local parks and identify potential areas for green infrastructure implementation
- Groups brainstorm and sketch initial ideas for park redesigns

## 7. Production Task (60 minutes)

- Students use design software to create a detailed redesign plan for an assigned urban park, incorporating at least three green infrastructure elements

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Each group presents their redesign concept to the class
- Class discussion on the potential impacts and benefits of the proposed designs

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students refine their park redesigns based on class feedback
- Write a one-page explanation of how their design addresses climate resilience and stormwater management

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Bioswale: A vegetated channel designed to filter and convey stormwater runoff
- Rain garden: A shallow depression planted with native species to capture and filter rainwater
- Permeable paving: Porous surfaces that allow water to infiltrate into the ground
- Urban heat island effect: The phenomenon where urban areas are significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas
- Ecosystem services: The benefits people obtain from ecosystems, including clean air, water filtration, and climate regulation
