   - Bee garden and pollinator pathway project
   - Educational programs on urban ecology and biodiversity

# Discussion Questions

1. How can stormwater management features in parks be designed to enhance rather than detract from recreational uses?

2. What are the potential challenges and solutions for maintaining green infrastructure elements in urban parks in Timor-Leste?

3. How might the urban heat island effect impact different communities in Timorese cities, and how can park design address these inequities?

4. What native Timorese plant species would be most suitable for urban park settings, considering both ecological benefits and cultural significance?

5. How can we balance the need for biodiversity with safety concerns in urban parks?

6. What ecosystem services provided by urban parks are most valuable in the context of Timor-Leste's cities?

7. How might climate change affect the design and management of urban parks in Timor-Leste over the next 50 years?

8. What strategies can be used to engage local communities in the design and stewardship of biodiverse urban parks?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Ecosystem Services Analysis

1. Choose an existing urban park in a Timorese city.
2. Conduct research on the park's current features and surrounding urban context.
3. Write a 500-word analysis of the ecosystem services currently provided by the park.
4. Propose three specific design interventions that would enhance or expand these ecosystem services.
5. For each intervention, explain:
   - The specific ecosystem service(s) targeted
   - The design elements involved
   - The expected benefits to the urban environment and community
   - Any potential challenges or considerations for implementation
6. Conclude with a brief reflection on the overall impact these interventions could have on urban resilience and quality of life.
