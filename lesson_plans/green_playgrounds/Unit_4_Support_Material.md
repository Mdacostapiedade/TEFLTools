Here's the support material for the lesson plan "Designing Resilient Urban Parks and Public Spaces" formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Lesson: Designing Resilient Urban Parks and Public Spaces

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Bioswale**: A vegetated channel designed to filter and convey stormwater runoff
- **Rain garden**: A shallow depression planted with native species to capture and filter rainwater
- **Permeable paving**: Porous surfaces that allow water to infiltrate into the ground
- **Urban heat island effect**: The phenomenon where urban areas are significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas
- **Ecosystem services**: The benefits people obtain from ecosystems, including clean air, water filtration, and climate regulation
- **Green infrastructure**: An approach to water management that protects, restores, or mimics the natural water cycle
- **Stormwater runoff**: Rainfall that flows over the ground surface, often picking up pollutants
- **Climate resilience**: The ability to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to hazardous events related to climate change
- **Biodiversity**: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
- **Low Impact Development (LID)**: An approach to land development that works with nature to manage stormwater as close to its source as possible

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Before and After Urban Park Transformation**:
   A side-by-side comparison showing an urban park before and after green infrastructure implementation. The "before" image shows a traditional park with large grass areas and impermeable surfaces. The "after" image highlights bioswales, rain gardens, permeable pathways, and diverse native plantings.

2. **Green Infrastructure Techniques Diagram**:
   An illustrated cross-section of a park showing various green infrastructure elements:
   - Bioswale along the park perimeter
   - Rain garden in a low-lying area
   - Permeable paving for walkways
   - Native tree canopy for shade
   - Underground water storage system

3. **Urban Heat Island Effect Infographic**:
   A visual representation comparing temperatures in urban areas with and without green spaces, demonstrating how parks and vegetation can mitigate the urban heat island effect.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Green Infrastructure Checklist**:
   A worksheet for students to use when analyzing local parks, including:
   - Existing green infrastructure elements
   - Potential areas for improvement
   - Stormwater management challenges
   - Biodiversity assessment
   - Community needs and preferences

2. **Park Redesign Planning Sheet**:
   A structured worksheet guiding students through the redesign process:
   - Site analysis section
   - Goals and objectives for the redesign
   - Green infrastructure elements to incorporate
   - Sketch area for initial design ideas
   - Considerations for climate resilience and stormwater management

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with design software
   **Solution**: Provide basic tutorials before the lesson and consider pairing tech-savvy students with those who need more support.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in visualizing green infrastructure concepts
   **Solution**: Use a variety of visual aids, including videos, 3D models, and if possible, organize a field trip to a local site with green infrastructure elements.

3. **Challenge**: Students proposing unrealistic design solutions
   **Solution**: Provide clear constraints and context for the redesign project, including budget limitations and local regulations. Encourage students to research successful case studies in similar climates.

4. **Challenge**: Lack of engagement from some students during group work
   **Solution**: Assign specific roles within each group (e.g., designer, researcher, presenter) to ensure all students have a clear responsibility.

5. **Challenge**: Students focusing solely on aesthetics rather than functionality
   **Solution**: Emphasize the importance of multi-functionality in the grading rubric and provide examples of how attractive designs can also be highly functional for stormwater management and climate resilience.
