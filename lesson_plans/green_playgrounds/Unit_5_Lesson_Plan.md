# Lesson Plan: Green Infrastructure for Coastal Resilience

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer
- Handouts with sea level rise projections for Timor-Leste
- Maps of coastal areas in Timor-Leste
- Materials for coastal model building (clay, sand, small plants, water)
- Transportation for site visit
- Cameras or smartphones for documentation

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the coastal flooding risks faced by Timor-Leste's cities due to climate change
- Identify and describe green infrastructure approaches for coastal protection
- Assess coastal vulnerabilities in a real-world setting
- Develop a basic coastal resilience strategy incorporating green infrastructure

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Show a series of before and after images of coastal flooding events in Southeast Asia. Ask students to discuss in pairs:
- What changes do you observe?
- What might have caused these changes?
- How might these changes impact coastal communities?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Sea level rise
- Storm surge
- Coastal erosion
- Living shoreline
- Coastal wetland
- Green-gray infrastructure

Use visual aids and local examples where possible.

## 5. Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### a. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding (15 minutes)
- Present current sea level rise projections for Timor-Leste
- Explain mechanisms of coastal flooding (sea level rise, storm surge, high tides)
- Discuss potential impacts on Timorese coastal cities

### b. Green Infrastructure for Coastal Protection (20 minutes)
- Introduce concept of living shorelines
- Explain benefits and methods of coastal wetland restoration
- Discuss integration of green and gray infrastructure for coastal defense

### c. Case Studies (10 minutes)
- Present 2-3 case studies of successful coastal green infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### a. Coastal Vulnerability Mapping (15 minutes)
In small groups, students use maps of a Timorese coastal town to identify and mark areas at risk from sea level rise and coastal flooding.

### b. Green Infrastructure Solutions Brainstorm (15 minutes)
Groups brainstorm potential green infrastructure solutions for their mapped area, considering local conditions and resources.

## 7. Production Task (60 minutes)

### Coastal Resilience Model Building
In their groups, students use provided materials to build a physical model of a resilient coastline, incorporating at least two green infrastructure elements. Groups present their models to the class, explaining their design choices.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points about coastal risks and green infrastructure solutions
- Address any questions or misconceptions
- Preview the upcoming site visit

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students research and write a one-page summary of a coastal green infrastructure project from another country, analyzing its applicability to Timor-Leste.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Sea level rise: The increase in the level of the world's oceans due to climate change
- Storm surge: An abnormal rise in seawater level during a storm, measured as the height of the water above the normal predicted astronomical tide
- Coastal erosion: The loss of coastal lands due to the removal of sediments or bedrock from the shoreline
- Living shoreline: A protected, stabilized coastal edge made of natural materials such as plants, sand, or rock
- Coastal wetland: Areas along coastal waters that are saturated or flooded with water and characterized by plants adapted to saturated soil conditions
- Green-gray infrastructure: An approach that combines nature-based solutions (green) with conventional engineering (gray) to provide coastal protection
