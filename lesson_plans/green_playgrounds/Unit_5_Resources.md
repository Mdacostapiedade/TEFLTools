## Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding

### Current Sea Level Rise Projections for Timor-Leste
- Global mean sea level rise projections: 0.43-0.84 m by 2100 (IPCC AR6)
- Timor-Leste specific projections: 0.39-0.77 m by 2100 (based on regional factors)
- Rate of sea level rise accelerating: currently 3.6 mm/year, expected to increase

### Mechanisms of Coastal Flooding
1. Sea Level Rise
   - Gradual increase in baseline sea level
   - Exacerbates impacts of other flooding mechanisms
2. Storm Surge
   - Temporary sea level rise caused by low pressure and wind during storms
   - Can raise water levels by several meters in severe storms
3. High Tides
   - Highest astronomical tides combined with sea level rise increase flood risk
   - King tides becoming more problematic

### Potential Impacts on Timorese Coastal Cities
- Increased frequency and severity of flooding events
- Erosion of beaches and coastal lands
- Saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers
- Damage to coastal infrastructure (roads, buildings, ports)
- Displacement of coastal communities
- Economic impacts on fisheries, tourism, and agriculture

## Green Infrastructure for Coastal Protection

### Living Shorelines
- Definition: Shoreline stabilization technique using native vegetation, natural materials
- Benefits:
  * Reduces erosion while maintaining natural coastal processes
  * Provides habitat for marine and terrestrial species
  * Improves water quality through filtration
  * Adapts to sea level rise over time
- Implementation methods:
  * Marsh creation or restoration
  * Oyster or coral reef restoration
  * Beach nourishment with vegetation planting
  * Hybrid approaches combining natural elements with structural components

### Coastal Wetland Restoration
- Importance of coastal wetlands:
  * Natural buffer against storms and flooding
  * Carbon sequestration ("blue carbon")
  * Habitat for diverse species
  * Water quality improvement
- Restoration techniques:
  * Hydrologic restoration (removing barriers to tidal flow)
  * Sediment addition to combat subsidence
  * Revegetation with native species
  * Invasive species removal

### Green-Gray Infrastructure Integration
- Concept: Combining nature-based solutions with conventional engineering
- Benefits:
  * Enhanced protection compared to either approach alone
  * Cost-effective over long term
  * Provides ecosystem services
- Examples:
  * Vegetated levees or seawalls
  * Artificial reefs combined with breakwaters
  * Mangrove forests in front of seawalls
- Considerations for Timor-Leste:
  * Local materials and vegetation
  * Traditional knowledge integration
  * Maintenance requirements and community involvement

# Discussion Questions

1. How might sea level rise and increased coastal flooding affect different sectors of Timor-Leste's economy (e.g., fisheries, agriculture, tourism)?

2. What are the potential social impacts of coastal flooding and erosion on Timorese communities? How might these impacts differ between urban and rural areas?

3. How can traditional Timorese knowledge and practices be integrated into modern coastal protection strategies?

4. What are the main challenges in implementing living shorelines or coastal wetland restoration projects in Timor-Leste? How might these challenges be addressed?

5. How does the integration of green and gray infrastructure compare to purely engineered solutions in terms of cost, effectiveness, and environmental impact?

6. What role can community engagement play in the success of coastal green infrastructure projects? How can we ensure equitable participation and benefits?

7. How might coastal green infrastructure projects in Timor-Leste need to be adapted compared to similar projects in other countries, considering local environmental, social, and economic factors?

8. What potential co-benefits (beyond coastal protection) could green infrastructure projects provide to coastal communities in Timor-Leste?

# Assignment Details

## Coastal Vulnerability Site Assessment

During the site visit to a coastal area, complete the following tasks:

1. Physical Observations
   - Document current shoreline conditions (erosion, vegetation, infrastructure)
   - Identify high water marks or signs of recent flooding
   - Note any existing coastal protection measures

2. Mapping
   - Using provided maps, mark areas of observed vulnerability
   - Identify critical infrastructure within potential flood zones
   - Note important ecosystems (e.g., mangroves, coral reefs) and their condition

3. Community Input
   - Interview at least two local residents about their experiences with coastal flooding or erosion
   - Document traditional practices or knowledge related to coastal protection

4. Green Infrastructure Potential
   - Identify at least three locations suitable for green infrastructure interventions
   - For each location, propose a specific intervention and explain its potential benefits

5. Photo Documentation
   - Take photographs to illustrate key observations and potential intervention sites
   - Ensure photos are georeferenced if possible

6. Reflection
   - Write a brief (1-page) reflection on the most significant insights gained from the site visit and how they relate to classroom learning

Deliverable: Compile your observations, maps, interview notes, photos, and reflection into a cohesive site assessment report. Be prepared to present your findings to the class.

## Case Study: Mangrove Restoration in Timor-Leste

The following case study provides an example of a successful coastal green infrastructure project in Timor-Leste:

### Background
In 2016, a community-based mangrove restoration project was initiated in the coastal village of Hera, located 12 km east of Dili. The area had experienced significant mangrove loss due to coastal development and firewood harvesting, leaving the shoreline vulnerable to erosion and flooding.

### Project Objectives
1. Restore 20 hectares of degraded mangrove forest
2. Enhance coastal protection against erosion and storm surges
3. Improve local livelihoods through sustainable mangrove-based activities
4. Increase community awareness about the importance of mangrove ecosystems

### Implementation
- Community engagement: Local leaders and residents were involved in all stages of planning and implementation
- Species selection: Native mangrove species (Rhizophora stylosa and Sonneratia alba) were chosen based on local conditions
- Planting technique: A combination of direct planting and natural regeneration was used
- Capacity building: Training provided to community members on mangrove ecology and restoration techniques
- Alternative livelihoods: Development of sustainable mangrove-based products (e.g., honey, handicrafts)

### Outcomes
- Over 100,000 mangrove seedlings planted, with a 70% survival rate after three years
- Reduced coastal erosion observed in restored areas
- Increased fish and crab populations reported by local fishers
- Establishment of a community-managed mangrove nursery
- Development of eco-tourism activities, providing additional income for the community

### Lessons Learned
- Community ownership is crucial for long-term project success
- Combining restoration with alternative livelihood development increases community buy-in
- Regular monitoring and adaptive management are necessary to ensure high survival rates
- Partnerships with local universities and NGOs can provide valuable technical support

This case study demonstrates the potential for green infrastructure projects to provide multiple benefits, including coastal protection, ecosystem restoration, and community development. It also highlights the importance of community engagement and the integration of ecological and social considerations in project design and implementation.
