Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Green Infrastructure for Coastal Resilience, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Green Infrastructure for Coastal Resilience Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Sea level rise: The increase in the level of the world's oceans due to climate change
- Storm surge: An abnormal rise in seawater level during a storm, measured as the height of the water above the normal predicted astronomical tide
- Coastal erosion: The loss of coastal lands due to the removal of sediments or bedrock from the shoreline
- Living shoreline: A protected, stabilized coastal edge made of natural materials such as plants, sand, or rock
- Coastal wetland: Areas along coastal waters that are saturated or flooded with water and characterized by plants adapted to saturated soil conditions
- Green-gray infrastructure: An approach that combines nature-based solutions (green) with conventional engineering (gray) to provide coastal protection
- Mangrove: A tree or shrub that grows in coastal saline or brackish water
- Coral reef: A diverse underwater ecosystem characterized by reef-building corals
- Seagrass: Flowering plants that grow in marine environments and form underwater meadows

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Sea Level Rise Projection Map:
   - A map of Timor-Leste's coastline showing projected sea level rise scenarios for 2050 and 2100
   - Color-coded to indicate different levels of inundation

2. Green Infrastructure Techniques Diagram:
   - Illustrated cross-section of a coastline showing various green infrastructure elements:
     * Mangrove forests
     * Coral reefs
     * Seagrass beds
     * Coastal wetlands
     * Dunes with native vegetation

3. Before and After Visualization:
   - Side-by-side images of a vulnerable coastal area:
     * Before: Showing erosion and flooding risks
     * After: With implemented green infrastructure solutions

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Coastal Vulnerability Assessment Worksheet:
   - Map of a Timorese coastal town
   - Checklist of vulnerability factors (e.g., elevation, infrastructure proximity, erosion rates)
   - Space for students to mark and describe vulnerable areas

2. Green Infrastructure Solutions Matrix:
   - Table with columns for different green infrastructure techniques
   - Rows for factors like cost, effectiveness, maintenance needs, co-benefits
   - Students fill in the matrix based on research and class discussions

3. Case Study Analysis Sheet:
   - Template for analyzing green infrastructure projects
   - Sections for project description, challenges addressed, techniques used, outcomes, and lessons learned

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Reports and Publications:
   - "Nature-based Solutions for Coastal Resilience in the Coral Triangle" by World Wildlife Fund
   - "Mangroves for Coastal Defence" by Wetlands International and The Nature Conservancy
   - "Green Infrastructure for Climate Resilience" by UN Environment Programme

2. Online Tools:
   - Global Sea Level Rise Viewer by NOAA
   - Coastal Resilience Mapping Portal by The Nature Conservancy

3. Local Resources:
   - Timor-Leste National Adaptation Plan
   - Reports from local environmental NGOs on coastal conservation efforts

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited local examples of green infrastructure
   - Solution: Use case studies from similar environments in Southeast Asia. Encourage students to envision how these solutions could be adapted to Timor-Leste.

2. Challenge: Students may struggle to understand complex climate projections
   - Solution: Simplify data into easily understandable visuals. Use local landmarks to illustrate potential impacts.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in visualizing long-term changes
   - Solution: Use before-and-after photos from other locations. Create simple time-lapse animations showing gradual changes.

4. Challenge: Limited access to coastal sites for field trips
   - Solution: Use virtual field trips with videos and photos. Invite guest speakers with coastal management experience.

5. Challenge: Students may feel overwhelmed by the scale of the problem
   - Solution: Focus on actionable, local-scale solutions. Highlight success stories from other communities.

6. Challenge: Integrating traditional knowledge with modern techniques
   - Solution: Invite local elders to share traditional coastal management practices. Discuss how these can be combined with new approaches.
