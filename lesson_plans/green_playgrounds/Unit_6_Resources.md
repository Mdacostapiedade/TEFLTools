- Climate action plans
  - Identify green infrastructure as a strategy for climate adaptation and mitigation
  - Set goals for expanding green infrastructure coverage citywide

## Funding Mechanisms and Partnerships

### Public Funding Sources
- Municipal bonds
  - Issue green bonds specifically for green infrastructure projects
  - Use general obligation bonds to fund large-scale green infrastructure initiatives
- Stormwater fees
  - Implement a dedicated fee based on impervious surface area
  - Use collected fees to fund citywide green infrastructure programs
- Capital improvement budgets
  - Allocate a percentage of annual capital budgets to green infrastructure
  - Integrate green infrastructure into existing infrastructure renewal projects

### Private Sector Involvement
- Public-private partnerships (PPPs)
  - Collaborate with developers to implement green infrastructure in new projects
  - Partner with businesses to maintain green infrastructure on public land
- Corporate sponsorship
  - Seek sponsorship for high-profile green spaces and demonstration projects
  - Develop "adopt-a-rain-garden" programs for businesses

### Non-profit and Community Partnerships
- Grant-making foundations
  - Apply for foundation grants focused on urban sustainability and resilience
  - Partner with local foundations to establish green infrastructure funds
- Community organizations
  - Collaborate with neighborhood groups on community-led green projects
  - Provide resources and training for volunteer maintenance programs

## Adapting Policies to Timor-Leste Context

### Considerations
- Limited municipal resources and capacity
- Informal settlements and land tenure issues
- Traditional water management practices
- Climate vulnerabilities specific to Timor-Leste

### Strategies
- Start with pilot projects to demonstrate effectiveness
- Focus on low-cost, high-impact solutions
- Integrate with existing development and climate adaptation plans
- Emphasize community engagement and participatory design
- Leverage international climate finance mechanisms

- Certification scheme for projects that meet ABC Waters standards
- Funding support for public projects and private development incentives

### Outcomes
- Over 100 projects completed nationwide
- Improved flood management and water quality
- Enhanced biodiversity and urban greenery
- Increased public awareness and stewardship of water resources

### Relevance to Timor-Leste
- Demonstrates comprehensive approach to integrating green infrastructure with water management
- Shows potential for creating multi-functional urban spaces
- Highlights importance of design guidelines and incentives
- Emphasizes community engagement and education

## Example Green Infrastructure Incentive Program: Portland, Oregon's Ecoroof Incentive

### Program Overview
The City of Portland offers a financial incentive for building owners to install ecoroofs (green roofs) to manage stormwater, improve air quality, and reduce urban heat island effect.

### Key Features
- $5 per square foot incentive for ecoroof installation
- Simplified permitting process for ecoroof projects
- Technical assistance provided by city staff
- Annual ecoroof tours and workshops for public education

### Eligibility Criteria
- Minimum size of 500 square feet
- Must meet structural loading requirements
- Must include specific layers (waterproofing, drainage, growing medium, vegetation)
- Maintenance plan required

### Program Results
- Over 400 ecoroofs installed citywide
- More than 20 acres of ecoroof area created
- Estimated 12 million gallons of stormwater managed annually

### Adaptation Considerations for Timor-Leste
- Scale incentive to local construction costs
- Focus on locally appropriate plant species
- Emphasize additional benefits like urban cooling and potential for urban agriculture
- Consider coupling with rainwater harvesting incentives
