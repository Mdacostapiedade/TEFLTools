# 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to adapt international case studies to the Timor-Leste context.
   **Solution**: Provide guided questions to help students critically analyze the transferability of policies. Encourage discussions on local cultural, economic, and environmental factors.

2. **Challenge**: Limited local examples of green infrastructure policies.
   **Solution**: Use examples from other developing countries in Southeast Asia. Invite guest speakers from local government or NGOs to discuss current initiatives or challenges.

3. **Challenge**: Students may lack background in policy writing.
   **Solution**: Provide clear templates and examples of policy briefs. Consider a mini-lesson on policy writing techniques before the main activity.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in understanding complex funding mechanisms.
   **Solution**: Use simple analogies and local examples to explain funding concepts. Create a glossary of financial terms relevant to green infrastructure.

5. **Challenge**: Varying levels of English proficiency among students.
   **Solution**: Provide key terms and definitions in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and diagrams to support text-based information.

6. **Challenge**: Limited access to up-to-date information on local policies.
   **Solution**: Create a class resource bank where students can share and update information they find on local policies and initiatives. Encourage research skills and critical evaluation of sources.
