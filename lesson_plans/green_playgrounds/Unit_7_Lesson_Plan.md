## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the importance of community engagement in green infrastructure projects
- Describe at least three participatory design methods
- Develop a basic community engagement strategy for a local project
- Conduct a simple participatory design activity

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Ask students to think about a time they felt truly engaged in a community project or decision-making process. What made it engaging? 
- Have pairs share their experiences, then discuss as a class, noting common themes on the whiteboard.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Participatory design
- Stakeholder
- Social equity
- Community asset mapping
- Charrette

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Benefits of community participation in green infrastructure projects
   - Increased project buy-in and support

   - Building community capacity
   - Ensuring equitable outcomes

2. Overview of participatory design methods
   - Community asset mapping
   - Design charrettes
   - Photovoice
   - Participatory budgeting
   - Digital engagement tools

3. Addressing social equity in green infrastructure planning

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Community Asset Mapping Exercise (20 minutes)
   - Divide class into small groups
   - Provide each group with a large map of a local neighborhood

   - Groups present their maps to the class

2. Role-play: Stakeholder Analysis (20 minutes)
   - Assign students different stakeholder roles (e.g., local resident, business owner, government official, environmental activist)
   - Present a hypothetical green infrastructure project
   - Have students discuss the project from their stakeholder perspective
   - Debrief on how different perspectives could inform project design

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

Mock Community Design Workshop:
- Divide class into facilitators and community members
- Present a simple green infrastructure challenge (e.g., designing a rain garden for a local park)
- Facilitators lead a short design workshop using participatory methods
- Debrief on the experience and lessons learned

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Key principles of community engagement
- Class discussion: How can we ensure genuine community participation in green infrastructure projects in Timor-Leste?

## 9. Homework Assignment

Develop a basic community engagement strategy for a green infrastructure project in your neighborhood. Include:
1. Project description
2. Key stakeholders to engage
3. Two participatory design methods you would use
4. Potential challenges and how you would address them
