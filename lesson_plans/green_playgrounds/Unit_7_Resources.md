# Lecture Notes

## Benefits of Community Participation in Green Infrastructure Projects

### Increased Project Buy-in and Support
- Community members feel ownership of the project
- Reduces opposition and NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) attitudes
- Increases likelihood of long-term success and maintenance

### Local Knowledge Integration
- Residents understand local conditions, history, and needs
- Can identify potential issues or opportunities professionals might miss
- Enhances project relevance and effectiveness

### Building Community Capacity
- Educates community on green infrastructure and climate resilience
- Develops skills in design, planning, and decision-making
- Empowers community to address future challenges

### Ensuring Equitable Outcomes
- Gives voice to marginalized groups
- Addresses specific needs of diverse populations
- Helps distribute benefits fairly across the community

## Overview of Participatory Design Methods

### Community Asset Mapping
- Definition: Visual inventory of community strengths and resources
- Process:
  1. Gather diverse community members
  2. Identify and locate assets on a map
  3. Discuss potential connections and opportunities
- Benefits: Builds on existing strengths, reveals hidden resources

### Design Charrettes
- Definition: Intensive, multi-day collaborative design workshop
- Process:
  1. Set clear goals and constraints
  2. Bring together diverse stakeholders
  3. Alternate between small group work and large group sharing
  4. Iterate on designs based on feedback
- Benefits: Generates many ideas quickly, builds consensus

### Photovoice
- Definition: Participants document their environment through photography
- Process:
  1. Provide cameras to community members
  2. Ask them to photograph relevant issues or assets
  3. Discuss photos and their meanings as a group
  4. Use insights to inform design
- Benefits: Captures visual data, empowers participants to share their perspective

### Participatory Budgeting
- Definition: Community members decide how to allocate part of a public budget
- Process:
  1. Brainstorm project ideas
  2. Develop proposals
  3. Community votes on priorities
  4. Implement winning projects
- Benefits: Increases transparency, ensures projects reflect community priorities

### Digital Engagement Tools
- Online surveys and mapping tools
- Social media campaigns
- Virtual reality simulations of proposed designs
- Benefits: Reaches wider audience, allows for ongoing engagement

## Addressing Social Equity in Green Infrastructure Planning

### Identifying Vulnerable Populations
- Analyze demographic data
- Consider factors like income, race, age, disability status
- Map vulnerable areas in relation to climate risks

### Ensuring Diverse Representation
- Actively recruit participants from underrepresented groups
- Provide multiple ways to engage (in-person, online, written)
- Offer childcare, transportation, or other support to enable participation

### Addressing Language and Cultural Barriers
- Provide materials in multiple languages
- Use cultural liaisons or community leaders to facilitate engagement
- Respect and incorporate traditional knowledge and practices

### Considering Distributional Impacts of Projects
- Assess who benefits and who bears costs of proposed projects
- Ensure fair distribution of green infrastructure across neighborhoods
- Consider potential for green gentrification and displacement

# Discussion Questions

1. How might community engagement in green infrastructure projects differ in Timor-Leste compared to other countries? What unique cultural or social factors should be considered?

2. What are potential challenges to implementing participatory design methods in Timor-Leste? How might these be overcome?

3. How can we ensure that traditionally marginalized groups (e.g., women, youth, people with disabilities) are meaningfully included in the participatory design process?

4. What role should local government play in community engagement for green infrastructure projects? How can we balance expert knowledge with community input?

5. How might digital engagement tools be effectively used in Timor-Leste, given potential limitations in internet access or digital literacy?

6. What are some potential negative consequences of community engagement if not done well? How can these be mitigated?

7. How can we maintain community engagement throughout the entire lifecycle of a green infrastructure project, from planning to implementation to maintenance?

8. In what ways can participatory design for green infrastructure projects contribute to broader community development and capacity building in Timor-Leste?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Essay: Community Engagement Experience

Write a 500-word reflective essay on a personal experience with community engagement or participatory design. This could be a project you were involved in, or one you observed in your community. Address the following points:

1. Briefly describe the project and the community engagement process used.
2. What worked well in the engagement process? What didn't work as well?
3. How did the engagement process impact the final outcome of the project?
4. What lessons from this experience could be applied to green infrastructure projects in Timor-Leste?
5. How did this experience change your perspective on the importance of community engagement?

Use specific examples and anecdotes to illustrate your points. Conclude with reflections on how you might approach community engagement in your future professional practice.
