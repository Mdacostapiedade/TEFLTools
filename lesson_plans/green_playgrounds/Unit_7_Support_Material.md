## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to understand the importance of community engagement.
   **Solution**: Use local case studies and invite guest speakers from successful community projects to share their experiences.

2. **Challenge**: Role-playing exercises may feel awkward for some students.
   **Solution**: Start with simple scenarios and gradually increase complexity. Provide clear instructions and encourage a supportive classroom environment.

3. **Challenge**: Students may have difficulty imagining green infrastructure in their local context.
   **Solution**: Organize field trips to existing green infrastructure sites or use virtual tours if physical visits are not possible.

4. **Challenge**: Addressing social equity issues may be sensitive.
   **Solution**: Establish ground rules for respectful discussion and provide factual information about local demographics and disparities.

5. **Challenge**: Students may lack confidence in facilitating community engagement activities.
   **Solution**: Provide opportunities for practice in class and offer constructive feedback. Consider partnering with local organizations for real-world experience.

6. **Challenge**: Limited time to cover all participatory design methods in depth.
   **Solution**: Focus on a few key methods in class and provide resources for students to explore others independently.
