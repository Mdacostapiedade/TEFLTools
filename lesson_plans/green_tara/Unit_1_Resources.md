## The Origin of Tara

Long ago, the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara gazed upon the world of suffering beings with great compassion. Seeing their pain, he began to weep. From one of his tears, the goddess Tara was born. She vowed, "I shall work for the benefit of beings in a female form until samsara is emptied."

Tara's name means "star" or "she who ferries across." Just as stars guide travelers, Tara guides beings to enlightenment. She protects from danger and assists in crossing the ocean of existence.

In Timor-Leste, Tara's arrival is linked to the introduction of Buddhism by traders and monks from India and Java. Her worship blended with local animist traditions, creating a unique Timorese form of Tara practice that persists to this day.
