## The 21 Praises to Tara (Tetum and English)

1. Homage! Tara, swift, heroic!
   Eyes like lightning instantaneous!
   Sprung from opening stamens of the 
   Lord of three world's tear-born lotus!

   Homenagem! Tara, lais, heroika!
   Matan hanesan rai-lakan momentu!
   Moris husi loke ai-funan tahan husi
   Nai mundu tolu nia matan-been lotus!

2. Homage! She whose face combines a
   Hundred autumn moons at fullest!
   Blazing with light rays resplendent
   As a thousand star collection!

   Homenagem! Nia oin kombina
   Fulan-atus tomak iha tempu bailoron!
   Lakan ho naroman nabilan
   Hanesan fitun rihun ida halibur!

## Example: Tara's Protection in Timorese Fishing Communities

In coastal villages of Timor-Leste, some Buddhist fishermen have adopted a practice of invoking Green Tara before setting out to sea. They believe her swift protection can guard against storms and ensure a safe return. A small shrine to Tara is sometimes placed on fishing boats, featuring her image and offerings of flowers and incense. Before departure, the fishermen may recite the mantra "OM TARE TUTTARE TURE SOHA" 21 times, visualizing Tara's green light enveloping their boat and crew.

This practice blends traditional Timorese maritime customs with Buddhist elements, demonstrating the adaptive nature of Tara worship in the local context. It also highlights how Tara's protective role extends to practical, everyday concerns in Timorese life.
