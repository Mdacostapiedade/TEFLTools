### The Origin of Tara's Mantra

Long ago, when the Buddha Amoghasiddhi was teaching the Dharma, a devoted disciple named Avalokiteshvara approached him with a question. "O Blessed One," he said, "I have been striving to save all beings from suffering, but for every being I help, it seems ten more appear in need. How can I possibly fulfill my vow to liberate all sentient beings?"

Moved by Avalokiteshvara's compassion, the Buddha replied, "Noble son, do not despair. Your great compassion has given rise to a new form of enlightened energy." As he spoke, a tear of compassion fell from Avalokiteshvara's eye. As it touched the ground, it transformed into a lotus flower, from which emerged the goddess Tara.

Tara spoke, saying, "Do not fear, Avalokiteshvara. I have been born from your compassion, and I vow to be the swift protectress of all beings. Those who call upon me will receive immediate aid." She then revealed her mantra: OM TARE TUTTARE TURE SOHA, explaining that it contained the essence of her liberating power.

From that day forward, Tara and Avalokiteshvara worked together to save beings from suffering, with Tara offering swift protection to all who invoked her name and mantra.
