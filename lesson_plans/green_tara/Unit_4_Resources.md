## Simplified Tara Sadhana Text (English Version)

1. Taking Refuge and Generating Bodhicitta
   I take refuge in the Three Jewels: Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.
   I generate bodhicitta for the benefit of all beings.
   May I attain enlightenment to free all beings from suffering.

2. Visualization of Tara
   In the space before me, I visualize Green Tara.
   She sits on a lotus and moon seat, her right foot extended.
   Her body is green, radiating light of wisdom and compassion.
   Her right hand is in the gesture of giving, her left holds a blue lotus.
   She wears silks and jewels, her face smiling with loving kindness.

3. Offering Prayers and Mantras
   OM TARE TUTTARE TURE SOHA
   (Recite 21 times or more)

   Noble Tara, swift protector,
   With the power of your compassion,
   Remove obstacles and grant blessings.
   May your wisdom illuminate our path.

4. Receiving Blessings
   Visualize light and nectar flowing from Tara,
   Purifying negativities and bestowing blessings.
   Feel Tara's qualities of fearlessness, wisdom, and compassion
   Awakening within your own heart.

5. Dedication of Merit
   By this merit, may all beings be free from suffering.
   May the blessings of Tara touch all hearts.
   May peace and harmony prevail in Timor-Leste and the world.

## Recommended Reading

Excerpt from "Tara: The Feminine Divine" by Bokar Rinpoche (adapted for Timorese context):

"Tara embodies the swift compassion of all enlightened beings. In Timor-Leste, we can see her protective nature reflected in the lush forests that guard our islands and the nurturing sea that surrounds us. Just as Tara extends her hand in the gesture of giving, so too does the Timorese spirit of community and sharing exemplify her generous nature. When we practice Tara sadhana, we are not only connecting with an ancient Buddhist tradition but also with the very essence of our Timorese values of compassion, protection, and resilience."
