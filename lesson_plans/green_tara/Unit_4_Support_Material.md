1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with visualization
   **Tip**: Start with simple visualizations, like a colored light or a single attribute of Tara. Gradually build up to more complex images.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty pronouncing Sanskrit mantras
   **Tip**: Provide phonetic guides and audio recordings. Consider using Tetum translations of mantras as an alternative.

3. **Challenge**: Integrating Tara practice with existing Timorese spiritual beliefs
   **Tip**: Encourage open discussions about how Tara's qualities might relate to local deities or spiritual concepts. Emphasize adaptation rather than replacement.

4. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by ritual complexity
   **Tip**: Break down the sadhana into smaller, manageable parts. Focus on understanding the meaning and purpose of each component before combining them.

5. **Challenge**: Lack of materials for creating personal altars
   **Tip**: Emphasize the use of locally available natural materials. Demonstrate how everyday objects can be repurposed for spiritual practice.

6. **Challenge**: Maintaining student engagement during longer meditation sessions
   **Tip**: Incorporate movement (e.g., mudras, prostrations) and vary between silent and guided meditation. Use storytelling to illustrate Tara's qualities and actions.
