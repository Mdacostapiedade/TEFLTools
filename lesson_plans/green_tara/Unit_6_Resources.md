# Excerpts and Short Stories

## "The Cult of Tara: Magic and Ritual in Tibet" by Stephan Beyer (adapted excerpt)

Tara, the Savioress, is the most popular goddess in the Buddhist pantheon. She is the goddess of universal compassion who represents virtuous and enlightened activity. Her primary purpose is to relieve sentient beings from suffering and to protect them from danger.

In Timorese Buddhism, Tara has taken on a unique significance, blending with local traditions and beliefs. She is often seen as a protector of the land and sea, a guardian of the environment that is so crucial to Timorese life and culture. Her green color is associated with the lush forests and fertile fields of Timor-Leste, while her role as a savioress resonates with the nation's history of struggle and resilience.

Tara practice in Timor-Leste often involves daily recitations of her mantra, visualizations of her form, and the performance of rituals aimed at invoking her protection and blessings. Many Timorese Buddhists keep small statues or images of Tara in their homes, turning to her in times of need or danger.

## "Tara: The Feminine Divine" by Bokar Rinpoche (translated and adapted for Timorese context)

In the Timorese context, Tara embodies not only the universal qualities of compassion and wisdom but also the strength and resilience of the Timorese people. She is seen as a mother figure, nurturing and protecting, but also as a fierce defender against injustice and environmental degradation.

Tara's twenty-one forms, each with a specific color and function, are particularly relevant in Timor-Leste. For example, Red Tara is invoked for protection against natural disasters, a constant concern in this earthquake-prone region. White Tara is called upon for longevity and health, addressing the health challenges faced by many Timorese communities.

In daily life, Timorese practitioners often begin their day with a short Tara practice, visualizing her form and reciting her mantra. This is seen as a way to infuse one's daily activities with her qualities of compassion, wisdom, and fearless action for the benefit of others.
