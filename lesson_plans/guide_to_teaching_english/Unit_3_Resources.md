## 1. Full Text of Timorese Folk Tale

### "The Legend of the Crocodile"

Long ago, there was an old crocodile who had lived for many years in the swamps of Timor. One day, he decided to go in search of food, as he was very hungry. He crawled and crawled, but he was so old and weak that he couldn't reach the sea.

A young boy saw the crocodile and took pity on him. The boy decided to help the crocodile get to the sea. He pushed and pulled until finally, the crocodile was in the water.

The crocodile was so grateful that he offered to take the boy on a journey. They traveled to many islands, and the crocodile kept the boy safe on his back.

When they returned to Timor, the crocodile said, "Young boy, you have been so kind to me. I am old and will soon die. When I die, my body will grow and grow. It will become the land where your people can live."

The crocodile died, and his body grew into the island of Timor. The island's shape resembles a crocodile, and the Timorese people believe they are born from the body of this ancient crocodile.
