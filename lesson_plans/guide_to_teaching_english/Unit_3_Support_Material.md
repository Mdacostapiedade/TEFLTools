## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students are reluctant to speak in English
   Tip: Start with controlled practice activities and gradually move to freer practice. Use pair work to reduce anxiety.

2. Challenge: Difficulty understanding authentic listening materials
   Tip: Pre-teach key vocabulary, use visual supports, and allow multiple listens with different focus each time.

3. Challenge: Large class sizes make speaking practice difficult
   Tip: Use group work and rotating pair activities to maximize student talking time.

4. Challenge: Limited access to audio equipment
   Tip: Use teacher's voice for listening activities or invite native speakers from the community when possible.

5. Challenge: Students struggle with pronunciation
   Tip: Incorporate regular pronunciation practice, use minimal pairs, and provide clear models.

6. Challenge: Adapting materials to Timorese context
   Tip: Collaborate with colleagues to create a bank of local stories and contexts that can be used in lessons.
