Here is a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 4 on Teaching Reading and Writing:

# Lesson Plan: Teaching Phonics and Early Literacy

## 1. Resources Needed

- Letter cards (one set per small group)
- Pictures of objects starting with target phonemes 
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with letter-sound matching activities
- Simple decodable texts for practice reading
- Writing paper and pencils

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, teachers will be able to:
- Explain the importance of phonics instruction for early literacy
- Demonstrate techniques for teaching letter-sound correspondences
- Plan activities to develop students' phonemic awareness
- Use decodable texts to practice early reading skills

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Play a quick game of "I Spy" focusing on initial sounds
- Example: "I spy with my little eye something beginning with /b/"
- Have teachers take turns giving clues and guessing

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Concepts (15 minutes)

- Introduce and define key terms:
  - Phonics
  - Phonemic awareness  
  - Grapheme-phoneme correspondence
- Explain the rationale for systematic phonics instruction
- Briefly discuss the challenges of teaching phonics in Timor-Leste given the different phonology of Tetum

## 5. Presentation of Main Content (30 minutes)

- Demonstrate techniques for teaching letter-sound correspondences:
  - Introduce letter name and sound together
  - Use memorable keywords and actions
  - Practice blending sounds to make words
- Model a sample phonics lesson focusing on 2-3 target phonemes
- Discuss strategies for sequencing phonics instruction

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- In small groups, have teachers:
  - Sort picture cards by initial sounds
  - Play letter-sound matching games
  - Practice blending sounds to read simple words
- Circulate to provide feedback and support

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Have teachers work in pairs to:
  - Plan a 10-minute phonics lesson for a specific phoneme
  - Create a simple game or activity to practice the target sound
- Ask 2-3 pairs to demonstrate their lessons to the group

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points about phonics instruction
- Address any questions or concerns
- Preview upcoming focus on teaching writing

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Read provided article on phonics instruction in EFL contexts
- Develop a week-long sequence of phonics lessons (15 minutes per day)
- Collect or create pictures to use as visual aids for target phonemes

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Phonics: A method of teaching reading and writing by developing learners' phonemic awarenessâ€”the ability to hear, identify, and manipulate phonemes
- Phoneme: The smallest unit of sound in spoken language
- Grapheme: A letter or combination of letters representing a single phoneme
- Blending: Combining individual sounds to pronounce a word
- Segmenting: Breaking a word into its individual sounds
- Decodable text: Text composed of words that can be sounded out using known letter-sound correspondences
