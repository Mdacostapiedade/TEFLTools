## Timorese Folk Tale: "The Crocodile and the Boy"

```
Long ago, there was a boy who lived by the sea. One day, he saw a small crocodile on the beach. The crocodile was hurt and could not move.

The boy felt sorry for the crocodile. He picked it up and took it to the water. The crocodile was happy and said, "Thank you, kind boy. One day, I will help you too."

Years passed. The boy grew into a man. One day, he was fishing in his boat when a big storm came. The waves were high, and his boat broke.

Just then, a big crocodile appeared. It was the same crocodile the man had helped long ago. The crocodile said, "Climb on my back. I will take you to land."

The man climbed on the crocodile's back, and it swam him safely to shore. The man thanked the crocodile for saving his life.

From that day, the people of Timor-Leste have respected crocodiles as their friends.

# 2. Detailed Lecture Notes

## Topic: Phonics and Early Literacy

### I. Introduction to Phonics
- Definition: A method of teaching reading by correlating sounds with letters or groups of letters
- Importance in early literacy development
- Challenges in the Timorese context (multiple languages)

### II. Key Components of Phonics Instruction
A. Phonemic Awareness
   - Ability to hear and manipulate individual sounds in spoken words
   - Activities: rhyming, sound isolation, sound blending

B. Letter-Sound Correspondences
   - Teaching the relationship between letters and their sounds
   - Importance of systematic and explicit instruction

C. Blending and Segmenting
   - Blending: Combining individual sounds to read words
   - Segmenting: Breaking words into individual sounds for spelling

### III. Strategies for Teaching Phonics
A. Multisensory Approach
   - Incorporate visual, auditory, and kinesthetic elements
   - Example: Using hand motions to represent sounds

B. Systematic Sequence
   - Start with most common and useful letter-sound relationships
   - Gradually introduce more complex patterns

C. Decodable Texts
   - Use texts that practice specific phonics patterns
   - Importance of controlled vocabulary in early readers

### IV. Adapting Phonics Instruction for Timorese Learners
- Considering phonological differences between Tetum, Portuguese, and English
- Incorporating local words and contexts in examples
- Addressing potential interference from other languages

## Topic: Process Writing Approach

### I. Introduction to Process Writing
- Definition: An approach that focuses on the process of writing rather than just the final product
- Stages: Prewriting, Drafting, Revising, Editing, Publishing
- Benefits for language learners

### II. Stages of the Writing Process
A. Prewriting
   - Generating ideas through brainstorming, mind mapping, etc.
   - Importance of activating prior knowledge

B. Drafting
   - Focus on getting ideas down without worrying about perfection
   - Encouraging fluency over accuracy at this stage

C. Revising
   - Looking at content and organization
   - Peer feedback and self-assessment techniques

D. Editing
   - Focus on grammar, spelling, and mechanics
   - Teaching students to use editing checklists

E. Publishing
   - Sharing final drafts with an audience
   - Celebrating student writing

### III. Implementing Process Writing in the Timorese Classroom
- Adapting the process for different age groups and proficiency levels
- Incorporating Timorese cultural elements in writing prompts
- Strategies for managing process writing with large classes

### IV. Assessing Writing in a Process Approach
- Using portfolios to track progress over time
- Balancing feedback on content and language
- Involving students in self and peer assessment

# 3. Discussion Questions

## Phonics and Early Literacy
1. How might the multilingual context of Timor-Leste affect phonics instruction? What challenges and opportunities does this present?
2. What are some culturally appropriate ways to teach letter-sound correspondences in Timorese classrooms?
3. How can we balance phonics instruction with other aspects of language learning in a communicative classroom?
4. What strategies can be used to support students who struggle with phonemic awareness?

## Process Writing Approach
1. How does the process writing approach differ from traditional writing instruction? What are its potential benefits for Timorese learners?
2. What challenges might you face when implementing process writing in your classroom? How could you address these?
3. How can we incorporate Timorese cultural elements into writing prompts and activities?
4. In what ways can peer feedback be effectively used in the writing process, considering Timorese cultural norms?

# 4. Writing Exercise Instructions

## Exercise 1: Phonics-Based Writing
1. Choose 5 target phonemes that you've recently taught.
2. Create a short, simple story (3-5 sentences) using words that contain these phonemes.
3. Illustrate your story with simple drawings to support comprehension.
4. Share your story with a partner and practice reading it aloud.

## Exercise 2: Process Writing - "My Favorite Timorese Tradition"
1. Prewriting (10 minutes):
   - Brainstorm Timorese traditions you know about.
   - Choose one favorite tradition and list key details about it.

2. Drafting (15 minutes):
   - Write a paragraph describing the tradition without worrying about perfect grammar or spelling.
   - Include what the tradition is, when it happens, and why it's important.

3. Revising (10 minutes):
   - Exchange drafts with a partner.
   - Read your partner's draft and provide feedback on content and organization.
   - Revise your own draft based on the feedback received.

4. Editing (10 minutes):
   - Use the provided editing checklist to check grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
   - Make necessary corrections.

5. Publishing (Optional):
   - Write or type a final clean version of your paragraph.
   - Add an illustration if time allows.

# 5. Assignment Details

## Assignment 1: Phonics Lesson Plan
- Develop a 30-minute phonics lesson plan for Timorese primary students.
- Choose 2-3 target phonemes to focus on.
- Include the following components:
  1. Warm-up activity
  2. Presentation of target sounds
  3. Guided practice activity
  4. Independent practice activity
  5. Assessment/wrap-up
- Include any necessary materials or visual aids.
- Be prepared to demonstrate a 10-minute segment of your lesson in the next class.

## Assignment 2: Writing Prompt Creation
- Create a set of 5 writing prompts suitable for Timorese primary students.
- Prompts should:
  1. Be culturally relevant to Timor-Leste

  4. Include brief teacher notes on how to use the prompt
- Submit your prompts along with a short reflection (200-300 words) on how these prompts support the development of writing skills in the Timorese context.
