Here are the support materials for the lesson plan on Teaching Phonics and Early Literacy:

# 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Phonics**: A method of teaching reading and writing by developing learners' phonemic awarenessâ€”the ability to hear, identify, and manipulate phonemes
- **Phoneme**: The smallest unit of sound in spoken language
- **Grapheme**: A letter or combination of letters representing a single phoneme
- **Phonemic awareness**: The ability to hear, identify, and manipulate individual sounds in spoken words
- **Blending**: Combining individual sounds to pronounce a word
- **Segmenting**: Breaking a word into its individual sounds
- **Decodable text**: Text composed of words that can be sounded out using known letter-sound correspondences

# 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Phonics Sound Wall:
   - A large chart displaying all the phonemes in English
   - Each phoneme is represented by its corresponding grapheme(s) and a picture of a word containing that sound

2. Blending Slider:
   - A simple diagram showing how individual sounds blend to form words
   - Three boxes in a row, each containing a letter
   - An arrow moving from left to right to demonstrate the blending process

3. Vowel Chart:
   - A visual representation of short and long vowel sounds
   - Each vowel sound is paired with a keyword and image

# 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Letter-Sound Correspondence Activity:
   - A worksheet with pictures of objects
   - Students write the initial sound of each object using the correct letter

2. Word Building Exercise:
   - A set of letter cards for students to manipulate
   - List of simple CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) words to build

3. Phoneme Segmentation Practice:
   - Words printed with sound boxes below
   - Students write one sound (phoneme) in each box

4. Decodable Sentence Writing:
   - A list of decodable words using target phonemes
   - Space for students to create their own sentences using these words

# 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Phonics from A to Z: A Practical Guide" by Wiley Blevins
2. "Phonemic Awareness in Young Children" by Marilyn Jager Adams
3. Online resource: Reading Rockets (www.readingrockets.org) - section on phonics instruction
4. Interactive phonics games on websites like Starfall (www.starfall.com)
5. "Jolly Phonics" program materials for multi-sensory phonics instruction

# 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling to hear individual sounds in words
   - Tip: Use exaggerated pronunciation and visual cues (like mouth movements) to help students identify sounds

2. Challenge: Confusion between similar sounds in English and Tetum
   - Tip: Explicitly compare and contrast sounds in both languages, using familiar Tetum words as examples

3. Challenge: Limited access to printed materials in English
   - Tip: Create word walls, use environmental print, and make simple books using local materials

4. Challenge: Large class sizes making individual practice difficult
   - Tip: Implement peer tutoring and small group rotations for more personalized attention

5. Challenge: Students having difficulty blending sounds into words
   - Tip: Start with two-sound words and gradually increase complexity. Use physical movements to represent blending

6. Challenge: Lack of parental support due to limited English proficiency
   - Tip: Provide simple activities that parents can do in Tetum to support phonemic awareness (e.g., rhyming games, identifying initial sounds in Tetum words)
