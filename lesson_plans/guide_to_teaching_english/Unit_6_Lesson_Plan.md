Here is a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 6: Materials Development and Adaptation:

# Lesson Plan: Adapting Materials for the Timorese Context

## 1. Resources Needed

- Sample English textbook unit
- Handouts with guidelines for materials evaluation 
- Poster paper and markers
- Projector (if available)
- Examples of Timorese cultural items, photos, or realia

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, teachers will be able to:
- Evaluate existing English teaching materials using specific criteria
- Adapt materials to make them more relevant for Timorese learners
- Create an original, contextualized activity for Timorese students

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- In small groups, teachers discuss:
  1. What makes a good English textbook or teaching material?
  2. What challenges have you faced using existing materials in your classroom?
- Groups share key points with the class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Concepts (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  - Materials evaluation
  - Contextualization 
  - Cultural relevance
  - Adaptation techniques
- Provide examples of each concept related to Timorese context

## 5. Presentation of Main Content (30 minutes)

- Present guidelines for evaluating English teaching materials:
  1. Age appropriateness
  2. Language level
  3. Cultural relevance
  4. Engaging content
  5. Clear instructions
  6. Variety of activities
  7. Opportunities for communication
  8. Visual appeal

- Demonstrate techniques for adapting materials:
  1. Substituting culturally relevant vocabulary or examples
  2. Modifying images or illustrations
  3. Adjusting the language level
  4. Adding communicative elements
  5. Incorporating local content

- Show before and after examples of adapted materials

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Materials Evaluation (20 minutes)
   - In pairs, teachers evaluate a sample textbook unit using the provided criteria
   - Pairs share their evaluations, discussing strengths and weaknesses

2. Adaptation Practice (25 minutes)
   - In small groups, teachers choose one activity from the textbook to adapt
   - Groups make changes to improve cultural relevance and engagement
   - Groups present their adaptations to the class

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

- Individually or in pairs, teachers create an original English language activity:
  1. Choose a language point (e.g. vocabulary set, grammar structure)
  2. Develop an activity incorporating Timorese cultural elements
  3. Write clear instructions for implementing the activity
  4. Consider how to make the activity communicative and engaging

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Teachers share their original activities with a partner or small group
- Whole class discussion:
  1. What were the challenges in adapting/creating materials?
  2. How can we ensure our materials are effective for Timorese learners?
  3. What resources can we use to find or create culturally relevant materials?

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Fully develop the original activity created in class, including any necessary materials or visuals
2. Choose one unit from your current textbook and make three specific adaptations to improve its relevance and effectiveness for your students
3. Reflect in writing: How will you approach materials development and adaptation differently after this lesson?

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- **Materials evaluation**: The process of assessing teaching resources based on specific criteria to determine their effectiveness and appropriateness
- **Contextualization**: Adapting teaching materials or methods to make them relevant to a specific cultural or educational context
- **Cultural relevance**: The degree to which educational materials reflect and relate to the learners' cultural background and experiences
- **Adaptation techniques**: Methods used to modify existing teaching materials to better suit the needs of a particular group of learners or teaching context
