## 1. Lecture Notes

### Evaluating Textbooks and Resources

#### Key Criteria for Evaluation
- Age appropriateness
- Language level
- Cultural relevance
- Engaging content
- Clear instructions
- Variety of activities
- Opportunities for communication
- Visual appeal

#### Evaluation Process
1. Familiarize yourself with the material
2. Use a checklist or rubric based on the key criteria
3. Consider both teacher and student perspectives
4. Identify strengths and weaknesses
5. Determine overall suitability for your context

#### Common Issues in ELT Materials
- Culturally inappropriate content
- Outdated information or examples
- Lack of communicative activities
- Insufficient scaffolding for learners
- Limited opportunities for personalization

### Developing Contextualized Materials

#### Principles of Contextualization
- Relevance to learners' lives and experiences
- Integration of local culture and traditions
- Use of familiar settings and situations
- Incorporation of authentic language use

#### Strategies for Creating Contextualized Materials
1. Use local names, places, and cultural references
2. Incorporate Timorese folktales, music, and art
3. Address topics relevant to Timorese society and daily life
4. Use authentic texts from Timorese media sources
5. Include activities that reflect local customs and practices

#### Benefits of Contextualized Materials
- Increased learner engagement and motivation
- Better comprehension and retention of language
- Development of cultural awareness and pride
- More meaningful and authentic language practice

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How do the English textbooks currently used in Timor-Leste measure up to the evaluation criteria we discussed? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

2. What specific aspects of Timorese culture and daily life should be incorporated into English language materials to make them more relevant for our learners?

3. How can we balance the need for culturally relevant materials with the goal of exposing students to diverse global perspectives through English?

4. What challenges might teachers face when adapting or creating their own materials, and how can these challenges be overcome?

5. How can we ensure that contextualized materials still meet curriculum requirements and prepare students for standardized tests?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

### Task: Adapting a Textbook Dialogue

1. Review the following dialogue from a standard English textbook:

   ```
   Sarah: Hi Tom! How was your weekend?
   Tom: It was great! I went to the mall and bought a new video game.
   Sarah: That sounds fun. I stayed home and watched movies with my family.
   Tom: Cool. Do you want to come over and play my new game after school?
   Sarah: Sure, that would be awesome!
   ```

2. Rewrite this dialogue to make it more relevant for Timorese learners. Consider:
   - Using Timorese names
   - Changing the setting and activities to reflect local customs
   - Incorporating common expressions or phrases used by Timorese youth

3. After adapting the dialogue, write a brief explanation (2-3 sentences) of the changes you made and why you think they improve the material for Timorese learners.

## 4. Assignment Details

### Creating an Original, Contextualized Activity

1. Choose a language point (vocabulary set or grammar structure) appropriate for primary school English learners in Timor-Leste.

2. Develop an original activity that teaches this language point while incorporating elements of Timorese culture. Your activity should:
   - Be engaging and interactive
   - Provide opportunities for meaningful communication
   - Include clear instructions for implementation
   - Be appropriate for the age and language level of your students

3. Create any necessary materials for your activity (e.g., worksheets, flashcards, game boards).

4. Write a lesson plan (300-400 words) explaining how to use your activity in class. Include:
   - Objectives
   - Target age/level
   - Time required
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Possible variations or extensions

5. Reflect on your activity (150-200 words):
   - How does it address the needs of Timorese learners?
   - What challenges did you face in creating it?
   - How might you improve or expand upon it in the future?

### Authentic Text Example

Excerpt from a Timorese English language newspaper (Timor Post):

```
Dili, 15 May - The Ministry of Education announced today a new initiative to promote reading in primary schools across Timor-Leste. The "Ler ho Ksolok" (Read with Joy) program will provide books in both Tetum and English to school libraries nationwide.

"We believe that fostering a love of reading from an early age is crucial for our children's educational development," said Minister of Education Dulce de Jesus Soares. "This program will give students access to a wide range of stories, including traditional Timorese tales and international children's literature."

The initiative aims to distribute 10,000 books to 100 schools by the end of the year. Teacher training on how to use these resources effectively in the classroom will also be provided.
