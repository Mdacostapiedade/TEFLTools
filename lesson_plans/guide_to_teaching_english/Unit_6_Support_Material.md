Here are support materials for the lesson plan on Adapting Materials for the Timorese Context:

# 1. Key Vocabulary List

- **Materials evaluation**: The process of assessing teaching resources based on specific criteria to determine their effectiveness and appropriateness
- **Contextualization**: Adapting teaching materials or methods to make them relevant to a specific cultural or educational context
- **Cultural relevance**: The degree to which educational materials reflect and relate to the learners' cultural background and experiences
- **Adaptation techniques**: Methods used to modify existing teaching materials to better suit the needs of a particular group of learners or teaching context
- **Realia**: Real-life objects used in classroom teaching to improve students' understanding of other cultures and real-life situations
- **Authentic materials**: Resources created for native speakers of a language, not specifically for language teaching purposes
- **Scaffolding**: Providing temporary support to help learners accomplish tasks they couldn't otherwise complete on their own

# 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Materials Evaluation Criteria Wheel
   (A circular diagram with 8 segments, each labeled with one of the evaluation criteria: Age appropriateness, Language level, Cultural relevance, Engaging content, Clear instructions, Variety of activities, Opportunities for communication, Visual appeal)

2. Adaptation Techniques Flowchart
   (A flowchart showing the process of adapting materials:
   1. Identify issues -> 2. Choose adaptation technique -> 3. Make changes -> 4. Review and refine)

3. Before and After Examples
   (Side-by-side comparisons of original textbook pages and adapted versions, highlighting changes made to improve cultural relevance and engagement)

# 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Materials Evaluation Checklist
   (A table with evaluation criteria, rating scale, and space for comments)

2. Adaptation Practice Worksheet
   (Template for teachers to plan adaptations, including sections for: Original activity, Issues identified, Adaptation technique chosen, Proposed changes)

3. Original Activity Development Guide
   (Step-by-step instructions for creating a new activity, with prompts for language focus, cultural elements, instructions, and engagement factors)

# 4. Additional Resources

5. "Culture in Second Language Teaching and Learning" by E. Hinkel (book)

# 5. Tips for Teachers

1. Challenge: Limited access to resources
   - Tip: Encourage resource sharing among teachers and schools. Create a materials bank where teachers can contribute and borrow adapted materials.

2. Challenge: Balancing local context with broader English-speaking world exposure
   - Tip: Aim for a mix of Timorese and international content. Use local contexts to introduce new language, then extend to global examples.

3. Challenge: Varying English proficiency levels among teachers
   - Tip: Pair less confident teachers with more proficient colleagues for adaptation tasks. Provide language support during the workshop as needed.

4. Challenge: Resistance to changing familiar materials
   - Tip: Emphasize the benefits of adaptation for student engagement and learning outcomes. Start with small, manageable changes to build confidence.

5. Challenge: Time constraints for material adaptation
   - Tip: Focus on high-impact adaptations that can be applied across multiple lessons. Develop a bank of Timorese-specific resources (e.g., photos, stories) that can be easily incorporated into various lessons.
