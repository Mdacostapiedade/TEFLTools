Here is a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 7 on Assessment and Feedback:

# Lesson Plan: Assessment and Feedback

## 1. Resources Needed

- Sample assessment tasks (quizzes, rubrics, etc.)
- Handouts on types of feedback 
- Audio/video clips of teacher-student interactions
- Whiteboard and markers
- Notebooks and pens for participants

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, participants will be able to:
- Distinguish between formative and summative assessment
- Design appropriate assessment tasks for young learners
- Provide effective oral and written feedback
- Use error correction strategies sensitively 

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- In pairs, participants discuss:
  1. How were you assessed as an English learner? 
  2. What kinds of feedback did you find most helpful?
- Whole group shares key points from discussions

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Concepts (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  - Formative assessment
  - Summative assessment  
  - Constructive feedback
  - Error correction
- Check understanding through quick True/False questions

## 5. Presentation of Main Content (30 minutes)

- Types of assessment:
  - Formative: ongoing, to improve learning
  - Summative: end of unit, to measure achievement
- Assessment techniques for young learners:
  - Observation checklists
  - Picture-based tasks
  - Simple self-assessment tools
- Principles of effective feedback:
  - Timely
  - Specific  
  - Balanced (positive and constructive)
  - Actionable
- Error correction strategies:
  - Selective correction
  - Self-correction
  - Peer correction

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. In small groups, analyze sample assessment tasks. Identify if they are formative or summative and discuss their effectiveness for young learners.

2. Individual task: Design a simple assessment activity for a specific language skill (e.g. listening comprehension, vocabulary use).

3. Role play in pairs: Practice giving oral feedback on a student's speaking performance. Switch roles.

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. In groups of 3-4, create a rubric for assessing young learners' writing.

2. Individually, write constructive feedback comments on sample student work provided.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key concepts covered
- Participants share one new idea they learned about assessment or feedback
- Address any remaining questions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Design 3 formative assessment tasks for a unit in the Timorese English curriculum
- Write a reflection (1 page) on how you plan to incorporate regular feedback in your teaching

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Formative assessment: Ongoing evaluation during learning to provide feedback and improve teaching/learning
- Summative assessment: Evaluation at the end of a learning period to measure achievement of learning objectives
- Rubric: A scoring guide that lists criteria for evaluating work or performance
- Constructive feedback: Comments that identify specific ways to improve, not just criticize
- Error correction: Techniques used to help learners recognize and fix language mistakes
