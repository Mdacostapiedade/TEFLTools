# Resources for Learning Unit 7: Assessment and Feedback

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Formative and Summative Assessment

#### Formative Assessment
- Definition: Ongoing evaluation during the learning process
- Purpose: To improve teaching and learning
- Examples:
  - Observation of student performance
  - Quizzes
  - Homework assignments
  - Student self-assessment
- Benefits:
  - Provides immediate feedback
  - Allows for adjustment of teaching strategies
  - Helps students identify areas for improvement

#### Summative Assessment
- Definition: Evaluation at the end of a learning period
- Purpose: To measure achievement of learning objectives
- Examples:
  - Final exams
  - End-of-unit tests
  - Projects
  - Portfolios
- Benefits:
  - Provides overall measure of student learning
  - Useful for grading and reporting
  - Can inform curriculum planning

### Error Correction Strategies

#### Selective Correction
- Focus on errors that interfere with communication
- Prioritize errors related to the current learning objective
- Avoid overwhelming students with too many corrections

#### Self-Correction
- Encourage students to identify and correct their own errors
- Provide prompts or clues to guide self-correction
- Build student autonomy and awareness

#### Peer Correction
- Students work together to identify and correct errors
- Can reduce anxiety compared to teacher correction
- Promotes collaborative learning

#### Delayed Correction
- Note errors during fluency activities without interrupting
- Address common errors with the whole class later
- Maintains flow of communication while still addressing errors

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How can formative assessment be integrated into daily classroom activities?
2. What are the potential drawbacks of relying too heavily on summative assessment?
3. How might cultural factors in Timor-Leste influence the way feedback is given and received?
4. What strategies can be used to make error correction a positive learning experience?
5. How can teachers balance the need for accuracy with the importance of fluency in language production?
6. What role can technology play in assessment and feedback in the Timorese context?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

### Feedback Analysis and Improvement

1. Read the following sample teacher feedback on a student's writing:

   "Good job. Your essay was interesting. Try to use better vocabulary next time."

2. Analyze this feedback based on the principles of effective feedback discussed in class.

3. Rewrite the feedback to make it more specific, constructive, and actionable.

4. Write a short paragraph explaining how and why your revised feedback is more effective.

## 4. Assignment Details

### Formative Assessment Design Project

#### Objective:
Design a set of formative assessment tools for a unit in the Timorese English curriculum.

#### Instructions:
1. Choose a unit from the Timorese primary English curriculum.
2. Create 3 different formative assessment tasks for this unit. These should include:
   - An observation checklist
   - A picture-based assessment task
   - A simple self-assessment tool for students

3. For each assessment task, provide:
   - A clear description of the task
   - The specific learning objectives being assessed
   - Instructions for administering the assessment
   - Criteria for evaluating student performance

4. Write a brief rationale (200-300 words) explaining how these assessments align with the principles of effective formative assessment and how they are appropriate for young learners in Timor-Leste.

#### Submission:
Submit your three assessment tasks and rationale as a single document, clearly labeled with your name and the curriculum unit chosen.

## 5. Additional Materials

### Sample Rubric for Assessing Young Learners' Writing

| Criteria | 3 Points | 2 Points | 1 Point |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Content | Writes on topic with several relevant details | Writes on topic with some details | Writing is off-topic or lacks details |
| Vocabulary | Uses varied and appropriate vocabulary | Uses some appropriate vocabulary | Uses limited or inappropriate vocabulary |
| Sentence Structure | Writes in complete sentences with some variety | Writes mostly in complete sentences | Writes incomplete or unclear sentences |
| Mechanics | Few errors in spelling and punctuation | Some errors in spelling and punctuation | Many errors that interfere with understanding |

### Error Correction Scenarios for Role Play

1. A student consistently mispronounces the 'th' sound in words like 'think' and 'three'.
2. During a speaking activity, a student uses the present tense when talking about past events.
3. In a writing task, a student repeatedly forgets to capitalize the first letter of sentences.
4. While reading aloud, a student struggles with several unfamiliar words.

For each scenario, practice providing feedback using different error correction strategies.
