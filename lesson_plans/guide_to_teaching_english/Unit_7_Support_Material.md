Here are support materials for the Assessment and Feedback lesson plan:

# Support Materials for Assessment and Feedback Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Formative assessment: Ongoing evaluation during learning to provide feedback and improve teaching/learning
- Summative assessment: Evaluation at the end of a learning period to measure achievement of learning objectives
- Rubric: A scoring guide that lists criteria for evaluating work or performance
- Constructive feedback: Comments that identify specific ways to improve, not just criticize
- Error correction: Techniques used to help learners recognize and fix language mistakes
- Peer assessment: Students evaluating each other's work or performance
- Self-assessment: Students evaluating their own work or performance
- Observation checklist: A tool used to record specific behaviors or skills observed during a task
- Performance-based assessment: Evaluation based on students demonstrating skills or knowledge through a task or project

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Formative vs. Summative Assessment Diagram:
   ```
   [A circular diagram showing formative assessment as an ongoing process throughout learning, with arrows pointing to "Adjust Teaching" and "Improve Learning". Summative assessment is shown as a single point at the end of the learning process, with an arrow pointing to "Measure Achievement".]
   ```

2. Effective Feedback Pyramid:
   ```
   [A pyramid diagram with four levels, from bottom to top:
   1. Timely
   2. Specific
   3. Balanced
   4. Actionable]
   ```

3. Error Correction Strategies Flowchart:
   ```
   [A flowchart showing:
   1. Error occurs
   2. Decision point: "Immediate correction needed?"
      - If Yes: Choose between "Teacher correction" or "Peer correction"
      - If No: "Note for later" leading to "Self-correction opportunity" or "Delayed teacher feedback"]
   ```

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Types of Assessment Handout:
   - Table comparing formative and summative assessment
   - Examples of each type suitable for young learners
   - Space for teachers to brainstorm their own ideas

2. Feedback Practice Worksheet:
   - Sample student work (e.g., short writing sample, recorded speaking task)
   - Guided questions for analyzing the work
   - Space to write constructive feedback comments
   - Reflection questions on the feedback process

3. Error Correction Scenarios:
   - List of common language errors made by Timorese students
   - Multiple-choice options for correction strategies
   - Discussion prompts for best practices

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Large class sizes making individual assessment difficult
   - Tip: Use peer assessment techniques and self-assessment checklists to involve students in the assessment process

2. Challenge: Limited time for providing detailed feedback
   - Tip: Focus on key areas for improvement and use a combination of written and oral feedback

3. Challenge: Students becoming discouraged by error correction
   - Tip: Balance positive feedback with areas for improvement, and teach students to view errors as learning opportunities

4. Challenge: Aligning assessment with Timorese curriculum requirements
   - Tip: Create a mapping document that links your assessment tasks to specific curriculum objectives

5. Challenge: Lack of resources for creating varied assessments
   - Tip: Use locally available materials and real-life tasks for performance-based assessments

6. Challenge: Ensuring consistency in assessment across different classes or teachers
   - Tip: Develop common rubrics and assessment criteria as a teaching team, and engage in moderation sessions
