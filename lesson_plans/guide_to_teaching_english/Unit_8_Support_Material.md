## 5. Tips for Teachers

### Potential Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Participants feeling nervous about peer teaching.
   **Solution**: Create a supportive atmosphere, emphasize that this is a learning experience, and start with shorter teaching segments.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in providing constructive feedback.
   **Solution**: Provide clear guidelines and examples of effective feedback. Practice giving feedback as a whole class before peer feedback sessions.

3. **Challenge**: Participants struggling with self-reflection.
   **Solution**: Offer prompts and guiding questions. Model self-reflection by sharing your own teaching experiences and reflections.

4. **Challenge**: Time management during peer teaching sessions.
   **Solution**: Use a timer and give time warnings. Assign a timekeeper in each group to help stay on schedule.

5. **Challenge**: Participants focusing only on negative aspects in reflections.
   **Solution**: Encourage a balanced approach by requiring identification of both strengths and areas for improvement in all reflections.
