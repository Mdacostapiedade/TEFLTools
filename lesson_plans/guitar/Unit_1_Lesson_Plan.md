     * Fingers relaxed over strings

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)
1. Guitar Parts Identification:
   - In pairs, students take turns pointing to and naming guitar parts
   - Teacher circulates to check understanding and provide assistance

2. Posture Practice:
   - Students practice sitting and standing with guitars
   - Teacher provides individual feedback and corrections

3. Hand Positioning:
   - Students practice left and right hand positioning
   - Teacher demonstrates proper technique and helps students adjust as needed

## Production Tasks (15 minutes)
1. Guitar Holding Relay:
   - Divide class into teams
   - Each team member must correctly hold the guitar in sitting and standing positions before passing to the next person
   - First team to complete the relay wins

2. Instrument Comparison:
   - In small groups, students discuss similarities between guitar parts and traditional Timorese instruments
   - Each group shares one similarity they found with the class

## Wrap-up and Review (5 minutes)
