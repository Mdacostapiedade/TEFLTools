## Unit Resources

# Lecture Notes

## Guitar Anatomy

### Body
- Main resonating chamber of the guitar
- Typically made of wood (e.g., spruce, mahogany, rosewood)
- Amplifies the vibrations of the strings
- Shapes include dreadnought, concert, jumbo

### Neck
- Long, narrow part extending from the body
- Contains the fretboard and frets
- Usually made of maple or mahogany
- Reinforced with a truss rod for stability

### Headstock
- Located at the top of the neck
- Houses the tuning machines
- Often displays the manufacturer's logo

### Frets
- Metal strips embedded in the fretboard
- Divide the neck into semitone intervals
- Allow for precise note production when strings are pressed against them

### Strings
- Six strings, traditionally made of steel for acoustic guitars
- Arranged from thickest (lowest pitch) to thinnest (highest pitch)
- Standard tuning: E A D G B E

### Tuning Pegs
- Mechanical devices used to adjust string tension
- Turn clockwise to increase pitch, counterclockwise to decrease
- Require regular maintenance for smooth operation

### Bridge
- Located on the body, anchors the strings
- Transfers string vibrations to the soundboard
- Often made of hardwood or synthetic materials

### Soundhole
- Circular opening in the body
- Helps project sound outward
- Contributes to the guitar's overall tone and volume

## Proper Posture

### Sitting Position
1. Sit on the edge of a chair with feet flat on the floor
2. Keep back straight and shoulders relaxed
3. Rest the guitar body on the right thigh (for right-handed players)
4. Hold the neck at a slight upward angle
5. Ensure the guitar is stable and comfortable

### Standing Position
1. Use a strap adjusted to proper length
2. Position the guitar so it sits at the same height as when sitting
3. Keep the guitar close to your body
4. Maintain relaxed shoulders and a straight back
5. Practice moving and shifting weight while holding the guitar

## Hand Positioning

### Left Hand (Fretting Hand)
1. Place thumb behind the neck, roughly opposite the index finger
2. Keep wrist straight, not bent
3. Use fingertips to press strings, not the pads
4. Maintain curved fingers, as if holding a small ball
5. Position hand so pinky can reach the first fret comfortably

### Right Hand (Strumming/Picking Hand)
1. Rest hand lightly on the guitar body near the bridge
2. Keep wrist straight and relaxed
3. Position fingers over the soundhole for strumming
4. For fingerpicking, assign thumb to bass strings (E, A, D) and fingers to treble strings (G, B, E)
5. Maintain a relaxed, natural curve in the fingers

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the design of a guitar contribute to its sound production?
2. In what ways might the anatomy of a guitar be similar to or different from traditional Timorese instruments?
3. Why is proper posture important when playing the guitar? How might poor posture affect a guitarist's performance?
4. How does hand positioning affect a guitarist's ability to play effectively? Discuss both left and right hand positioning.
5. What challenges might new guitarists face when learning proper posture and hand positioning?
6. How do you think the materials used in guitar construction (e.g., different types of wood) might affect the instrument's sound?
7. Why is it important to understand the parts of the guitar? How might this knowledge help you as you learn to play?
8. How do you think playing guitar might be different when sitting versus standing? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each position?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Guitar Reflection Journal

Write a 1-2 page reflection on your first experience holding and examining a guitar. Address the following points:

1. Describe your initial impressions of the guitar's appearance and feel.
2. Explain any challenges you encountered when trying to achieve proper posture and hand positioning.
3. Compare the guitar to a traditional Timorese instrument you're familiar with. What similarities and differences did you notice?
4. Reflect on your goals for learning guitar and how understanding its anatomy might help you achieve these goals.
5. Discuss any surprises or interesting discoveries you made during this first lesson.

Format: Double-spaced, 12-point font
Due: At the beginning of next week's lesson

# Assignment Details

## Guitar Parts Diagram and Comparison

### Part 1: Guitar Diagram
- Draw a detailed diagram of an acoustic guitar from memory
- Label all major parts discussed in class (body, neck, headstock, frets, strings, tuning pegs, bridge, soundhole)
- Include at least three additional parts or details not explicitly covered in class (e.g., nut, saddle, pickguard)

### Part 2: Instrument Comparison
Write a short essay (250-300 words) comparing the guitar to a traditional Timorese instrument of your choice. Include:
- A brief description of the chosen Timorese instrument
- At least three similarities between the guitar and the Timorese instrument (in terms of structure, playing technique, or cultural significance)
- At least three differences between the two instruments
- A reflection on how understanding these similarities and differences might help in learning to play the guitar

Due: At the beginning of next week's lesson
