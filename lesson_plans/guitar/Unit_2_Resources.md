## Open Chords: A, D, and E

### A Chord
- Finger placement:
  * 1st finger on 2nd fret of 4th string (D string)

- Open strings: 4th (D) and 5th (A)
- Common mistakes to watch for:
  * Fingers crowding each other
  * Not arching fingers enough, causing muting

### E Chord
- Finger placement:
  * 1st finger on 1st fret of 3rd string (G string)
  * 2nd finger on 2nd fret of 5th string (A string)
  * 3rd finger on 2nd fret of 4th string (D string)
- Open strings: 1st (high E), 2nd (B), and 6th (low E)
- Common mistakes to watch for:
  * Placing fingers on wrong frets
  * Not pressing down hard enough on 1st finger

## Basic Downstroke Strumming Pattern

- Hold pick between thumb and index finger
- Keep wrist loose and relaxed
- Start with pick above the strings
- Move pick downward across all strings in one fluid motion
- Practice at a slow, steady tempo
- Gradually increase speed as comfort improves
- Focus on maintaining consistent rhythm and volume

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the shape of each chord (A, D, E) relate to the sound it produces?
2. What challenges did you face when switching between chords? How might you overcome these?
3. How does the strumming pattern affect the overall sound and feel of a song?
4. Can you think of any Timorese songs that use these chords? How might learning these chords help you play local music?
5. How does proper hand positioning contribute to playing chords effectively?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a short paragraph (5-7 sentences) describing your experience learning the A, D, and E chords. Include:
- Which chord you found easiest/most difficult and why
- How the strumming pattern felt (natural, challenging, etc.)
- One specific way you plan to improve your chord playing this week

# Assignment Details

## Daily Practice Routine
- Spend 10 minutes forming and holding each chord (A, D, E)
  * Focus on proper finger placement and pressure
  * Practice transitioning between chords smoothly
- Dedicate 5 minutes to practicing the downstroke strumming pattern on each chord
  * Start slowly, gradually increasing speed
  * Aim for consistent rhythm and volume

## Song Practice
- Listen to the Timorese folk song "Kolele Mai" (lyrics and chords provided)
- Practice playing along with the recording, focusing on:
  * Correct chord changes
  * Maintaining steady strumming pattern
  * Matching the tempo of the recording

## Timorese Guitar Context

In Timorese music, the guitar often plays a supporting role to vocals, providing rhythmic and harmonic foundation. The A, D, and E chords are commonly used in many traditional songs, making them essential for playing local music. As students progress, they'll discover how these basic chords can be combined to create the unique sounds of Timorese folk and popular music.
