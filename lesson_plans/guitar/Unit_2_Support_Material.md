# Support Material for Basic Chords and Strumming Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Open chord**: A chord that uses open strings along with fretted notes
- **Fret**: Metal strips on the guitar neck that divide it into semitone intervals
- **Downstroke**: A strumming motion moving from the top strings to the bottom strings
- **Chord progression**: A sequence of chords played in a specific order
- **Strumming pattern**: A repeated rhythm used when playing chords on a guitar
- **Finger placement**: The position of fingers on the fretboard to form a chord
- **Rhythm**: The pattern of regular or irregular pulses in music
- **Tempo**: The speed at which a piece of music is played

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Chord Diagrams:
   - A diagram showing the fretboard with dots indicating finger placement for A, D, and E chords
   - Include string numbers and fret numbers for reference

2. Strumming Pattern Diagram:
   - A visual representation of the basic downstroke pattern using arrows and timing marks

3. Guitar Anatomy Poster:
   - An labeled illustration of an acoustic guitar, identifying key parts (body, neck, headstock, strings, frets, etc.)

4. Proper Hand Position Illustrations:
   - Drawings or photos showing correct left-hand positioning for fretting chords
   - Drawings or photos demonstrating proper right-hand positioning for strumming

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Chord Formation Practice Sheet:
   - Blank chord diagrams for A, D, and E chords for students to fill in
   - Space for students to write common fingering issues they encounter

2. Strumming Pattern Worksheet:
   - Notation of the basic downstroke pattern
   - Exercises for practicing the pattern with different chord progressions

3. Timorese Folk Song Chord Chart:
   - Lyrics of the chosen folk song with chord symbols above the appropriate words
   - A separate chord progression chart showing the sequence of chords

4. Daily Practice Log:
   - A weekly chart for students to track their practice time for each assigned task

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Online Resources:
   - Links to free online chord libraries (e.g., Chordbook.com)
   - YouTube tutorials on basic guitar techniques

2. Recommended Books:
   - "Hal Leonard Guitar Method, Complete Edition" by Will Schmid and Greg Koch
   - "The First 100 Chords for Guitar" by Joseph Alexander

3. Mobile Apps:
   - GuitarTuna for tuning and chord practice
   - Yousician for interactive lessons and feedback

4. Local Music:
   - List of Timorese artists and songs that use the chords taught in the lesson
   - Information on where to find local guitar performances or workshops

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Finger Pain:
   - Encourage short, frequent practice sessions to build calluses
   - Demonstrate proper finger placement to minimize discomfort

2. Difficulty Switching Chords:
   - Practice "chord changes" exercises where students switch between two chords slowly
   - Use a metronome to gradually increase speed of chord changes

3. Inconsistent Strumming:
   - Have students practice strumming on muted strings to focus on rhythm
   - Use clapping exercises to reinforce sense of timing

4. Frustration with Progress:
   - Set small, achievable goals for each practice session
   - Celebrate small victories and improvements

5. Varying Skill Levels in Class:
   - Prepare additional challenges for quick learners (e.g., more complex strumming patterns)
   - Use peer teaching to engage advanced students and help struggling ones

6. Limited Access to Instruments:
   - Organize practice groups for shared instrument time
   - Provide alternative activities like chord diagram drawing or rhythm exercises when guitars aren't available

7. Cultural Relevance:
   - Continuously seek input from students on local music preferences
   - Invite local musicians to give guest lectures or demonstrations
