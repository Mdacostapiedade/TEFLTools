# Lesson Plan: Reading Chord Charts and Tablature

## 1. Resources Needed

- Acoustic guitars (1 per student or shared)
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with chord charts and tablature examples
- Projector (if available) to display chord charts and tablature
- Audio playback device

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Interpret basic chord chart symbols and notation
- Read and play simple melodies using guitar tablature
- Understand the relationship between chord charts, tablature, and standard notation

## 3. Warm-up Activity (5 minutes)

- Quick review of open chords A, D, and E learned in previous lesson
- Students play a simple chord progression (e.g., A-D-E-A) to warm up fingers

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Chord chart
- Tablature (tab)
- Fret
- String number
- Finger number

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)

### Chord Charts
- Explain the layout of a chord chart (vertical lines for strings, horizontal lines for frets)
- Demonstrate how to read finger placement on chord charts
- Show examples of common chord chart symbols (open string, muted string)

### Tablature
- Introduce the concept of tablature as a simplified notation system
- Explain how tablature represents guitar strings and fret numbers
- Demonstrate how to read single notes and simple melodies on tablature

## 6. Practice Activities (25 minutes)

### Chord Chart Reading
- Provide students with a handout of new chord charts (e.g., C, G, Am)
- Have students practice forming these chords using the charts
- Check for proper finger placement and chord clarity

### Tablature Reading
- Distribute a handout with a simple Timorese melody in tablature
- Guide students through reading the tablature line by line
- Have students play the melody slowly, focusing on accuracy

## 7. Production Tasks (20 minutes)

### Chord Progression Activity
- Write a chord progression on the board using chord names (e.g., Am-C-G-D)
- Students use chord charts to play through the progression

### Tablature Performance
- In pairs, students take turns playing the Timorese melody from the tablature handout
- One student plays while the other provides feedback on accuracy

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (5 minutes)

- Recap the key points of reading chord charts and tablature
- Address any common mistakes or difficulties observed during the lesson
- Preview how these skills will be used in future lessons

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Practice reading and playing 3 new chords from chord charts
- Transcribe a simple Timorese melody into tablature by ear (provide audio reference)
- Create a chord chart for one chord not covered in class

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- **Chord chart**: A visual representation of how to play a guitar chord, showing finger placement on strings and frets
- **Tablature (tab)**: A form of musical notation indicating instrument fingering rather than musical pitches
- **Fret**: Metal strips on the guitar neck that divide it into pitch intervals
- **String number**: The numbering system for guitar strings, with the thinnest string being 1 and the thickest being 6
- **Finger number**: The numbering system for fretting hand fingers, with the index finger as 1 and the pinky as 4
