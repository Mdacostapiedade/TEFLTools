# Lecture Notes

## Chord Charts

### Introduction to Chord Charts
- Chord charts are visual representations of how to play guitar chords
- They show finger placement on strings and frets
- Vertical lines represent strings, horizontal lines represent frets

### Reading Chord Charts
- Numbers inside dots indicate which finger to use
- X means don't play that string
- O means play the open string
- Barre chords are indicated by a thick line across multiple strings

### Common Chord Chart Symbols
- Half barre: a curved line across some strings
- Muted string: an X above the string
- Optional notes: shown in parentheses

## Tablature

### Introduction to Tablature
- Tablature (tab) is a simplified notation system for stringed instruments
- It shows where to place fingers rather than which notes to play

### Reading Tablature
- Six horizontal lines represent the six guitar strings
- Numbers on the lines indicate which fret to play on that string
- 0 means play the open string
- Multiple numbers stacked vertically are played simultaneously

### Advanced Tablature Symbols
- h: hammer-on
- p: pull-off
- b: bend
- /: slide up
- \: slide down

# Discussion Questions

1. How does reading chord charts differ from reading standard musical notation?
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using tablature instead of standard notation?
3. How might chord charts and tablature be useful for preserving and sharing traditional Timorese music?
4. In what situations might a guitarist prefer to use chord charts over tablature, or vice versa?
5. How can understanding chord charts and tablature help in learning new songs more quickly?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Chord Chart Creation
1. Choose a chord you know how to play that hasn't been covered in class.
2. On a blank piece of paper, draw six vertical lines to represent the guitar strings.
3. Add horizontal lines to represent the first three frets.
4. Mark the finger positions for your chosen chord using dots and numbers.
5. Indicate any open or muted strings.
6. Write the name of the chord above your chart.

## Tablature Transcription
1. Listen to the provided audio clip of a simple Timorese melody.
2. On lined paper, draw six horizontal lines to represent the guitar strings.
3. As you listen to the melody, write down the fret numbers for each note on the appropriate string line.
4. Pay attention to the rhythm and try to space the numbers accordingly.
5. Listen to the clip multiple times to refine your transcription.

# Assignment Details

## Chord Chart Reading Practice
- Study the provided handout with new chord charts for C, G, and Am.
- Practice forming each chord, paying close attention to finger placement.
- Strum each chord 4 times, then switch to the next chord.
- Create a simple progression using these chords (e.g., C-Am-G-C) and practice transitioning smoothly.

## Tablature Reading and Playing
- Using the provided tablature for a simple Timorese melody, practice reading and playing the notes.
- Start by playing very slowly, focusing on accuracy.
- Gradually increase speed as you become more comfortable with the melody.
- Try to play the melody without looking at the tablature once you've memorized it.

## Homework
1. Practice reading and playing 3 new chords from the provided chord charts.
2. Transcribe a simple Timorese melody into tablature by ear (use the provided audio reference).
3. Create a chord chart for one chord not covered in class, following the writing exercise instructions.
