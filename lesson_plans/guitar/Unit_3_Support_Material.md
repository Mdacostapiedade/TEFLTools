# Support Material for Reading Chord Charts and Tablature Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Chord chart**: A visual representation of how to play a guitar chord, showing finger placement on strings and frets
- **Tablature (tab)**: A form of musical notation indicating instrument fingering rather than musical pitches
- **Fret**: Metal strips on the guitar neck that divide it into pitch intervals
- **String number**: The numbering system for guitar strings, with the thinnest string being 1 and the thickest being 6
- **Finger number**: The numbering system for fretting hand fingers, with the index finger as 1 and the pinky as 4
- **Open string**: A string that is played without pressing any frets
- **Muted string**: A string that is not meant to be played or is dampened to prevent it from ringing out
- **Chord progression**: A sequence of chords played in a specific order

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Chord Chart Diagram:
   - A vertical diagram showing 6 vertical lines representing strings
   - 5 horizontal lines representing frets
   - Black dots indicating where to place fingers
   - Numbers above the diagram showing finger placement
   - 'O' above a string for open strings
   - 'X' above a string for muted strings

2. Tablature Diagram:
   - 6 horizontal lines representing guitar strings
   - Numbers on the lines indicating which fret to play
   - String numbers labeled on the left side (1-6)

3. Guitar Neck Diagram:
   - A horizontal representation of the guitar neck
   - Frets numbered from 1-12
   - Strings labeled from 1-6

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

   - Practice exercises for transitioning between chords

2. Tablature Reading Exercise:
   - A simple Timorese melody written in tablature
   - Blank staff below for students to transcribe into standard notation
   - Questions about note duration and rhythm

3. Chord Progression Worksheet:
   - Several common chord progressions written as chord names
   - Space for students to draw the corresponding chord charts
   - A section to write a short analysis of each progression

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with finger placement on chord charts
   - Tip: Use a larger, clearer chord chart diagram and demonstrate slowly. Encourage students to place fingers one at a time.

2. Challenge: Difficulty reading tablature rhythms
   - Tip: Introduce basic rhythm notation alongside tablature. Use clapping exercises to reinforce rhythm before adding guitar.

3. Challenge: Confusion between chord charts and tablature
   - Tip: Clearly differentiate between the two, explaining that chord charts show multiple notes played simultaneously, while tablature typically shows individual notes.

4. Challenge: Students with varying skill levels in the same class
   - Tip: Prepare additional exercises for advanced students and offer simplified versions for those who are struggling.

5. Challenge: Limited access to guitars for practice
   - Tip: Encourage pair work during class, teach finger exercises that can be practiced without a guitar, and suggest alternative practice methods (e.g., air guitar with a chord chart).

6. Challenge: Relating Western notation to Timorese musical traditions
   - Tip: Draw parallels between chord progressions in Western and Timorese music. Use familiar Timorese melodies when introducing tablature reading.
