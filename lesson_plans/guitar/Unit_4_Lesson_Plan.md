- Teach basic alternating bass pattern using thumb on 6th and 4th strings
- Practice with A chord: 6th string, 4th string, 6th string, 4th string

### 3. Simple Fingerpicking Pattern (10 minutes)
- Introduce pattern: p, i, m, a
- Practice slowly on open strings
- Apply pattern to A chord

## Practice Activities (20 minutes)

### 1. Alternating Bass Exercise (5 minutes)
- Students practice alternating bass pattern on A, D, and E chords

### 2. Fingerpicking Pattern Drill (10 minutes)
- Students practice p, i, m, a pattern on open strings
- Apply pattern to A, D, and E chords

### 3. Guided Practice (5 minutes)
- Play along with teacher, focusing on maintaining steady rhythm

## Production Task (15 minutes)
- In pairs, students take turns playing the fingerpicking pattern while the other provides feedback
- Each student attempts to play a simple Timorese melody using the new fingerpicking technique

## Wrap-up and Review (5 minutes)
- Class discussion: What was challenging? What felt natural?
- Quick demonstration by 2-3 volunteers

## Homework Assignment
1. Practice alternating bass pattern for 10 minutes daily
2. Practice p, i, m, a fingerpicking pattern for 15 minutes daily
3. Attempt to apply fingerpicking to a simple song of their choice
