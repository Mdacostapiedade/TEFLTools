# Lecture Notes

## Finger Assignments

- Proper hand position is crucial for effective fingerpicking
  * Right hand should be relaxed and slightly arched
  * Wrist should be slightly bent, not flat against the guitar
  * Fingers should be curved, not straight

- Standard finger assignments:
  * Thumb (p): Responsible for 6th, 5th, and 4th strings (bass notes)
  * Index (i): Assigned to the 3rd string
  * Middle (m): Assigned to the 2nd string
  * Ring (a): Assigned to the 1st string

- Benefits of consistent finger assignments:
  * Develops muscle memory
  * Improves accuracy and speed
  * Allows for more complex patterns as skills develop

## Alternating Bass Pattern

- Alternating bass is a fundamental fingerpicking technique
  * Creates a steady rhythm and harmonic foundation
  * Mimics the sound of a bass guitar in a band

- Basic pattern using A chord:
  1. Thumb plucks 6th string (low E)
  2. Thumb plucks 4th string (D)
  3. Repeat

- Importance of steady rhythm:
  * Count "1-2-3-4" while playing to maintain tempo
  * Start slowly and gradually increase speed

- Applying to different chords:
  * D chord: Alternate between 4th and 3rd strings
  * E chord: Alternate between 6th and 4th strings

## Simple Fingerpicking Pattern

- Basic p, i, m, a pattern:
  1. Thumb (p) plucks bass note
  2. Index (i) plucks 3rd string
  3. Middle (m) plucks 2nd string
  4. Ring (a) plucks 1st string

- Practice steps:
  1. Start with open strings to focus on right-hand technique
  2. Apply pattern to A chord once comfortable
  3. Gradually introduce D and E chords

- Tips for smooth execution:
  * Keep fingers close to the strings
  * Use fingertips, not nails (unless developing a nail technique)
  * Maintain a steady, even rhythm

# Discussion Questions

1. How does fingerpicking differ from strumming, and what unique sounds or textures can it create in music?

2. In what ways might fingerpicking techniques be used in traditional Timorese music? Can you think of any local songs that could benefit from this technique?

3. What challenges did you face when trying to coordinate your thumb for the alternating bass pattern? How did you overcome them?

4. How do you think developing finger independence through fingerpicking might benefit your overall guitar playing skills?

5. Can you think of any popular songs (Timorese or international) that use fingerpicking prominently? How does it contribute to the song's mood or style?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a short paragraph (5-7 sentences) describing your experience learning fingerpicking so far. Include:
- Your initial impressions of the technique
- Any challenges you've faced
- How you think fingerpicking might enhance your guitar playing
- A goal you have for your fingerpicking skills

# Assignment Details

## Daily Practice Routine

1. Alternating Bass Pattern (10 minutes)
   - Practice on A, D, and E chords
   - Focus on maintaining steady rhythm
   - Gradually increase tempo as comfort improves

2. P, I, M, A Fingerpicking Pattern (15 minutes)
   - Start with open strings
   - Progress to A, D, and E chords
   - Aim for smooth transitions between fingers

3. Song Application (10 minutes)
   - Choose a simple song (Timorese or international)
   - Attempt to apply the fingerpicking pattern to the song's chord progression
   - Note any difficulties to discuss in next class

## Weekly Goals

1. Consistently perform the alternating bass pattern on A, D, and E chords without pausing
2. Execute the p, i, m, a pattern smoothly on open strings and at least one chord
3. Apply basic fingerpicking to one simple song of your choice

```
String:  [6] [5] [4] [3] [2] [1]
Finger:   p       p   i   m   a
Beat:     1       2   3   4   

p = thumb
