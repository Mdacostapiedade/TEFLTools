## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Hand Position Diagram:
   - A simple drawing of a right hand positioned over guitar strings, with fingers labeled (p, i, m, a).
   - Arrows indicating which strings each finger typically plucks.

2. Alternating Bass Pattern:
   - A diagram showing the 6th and 4th strings, with arrows alternating between them to represent the thumb movement.

3. Fingerpicking Pattern Chart:
   - A grid with columns representing beats and rows representing fingers (p, i, m, a).
   - Dots in the grid show which finger plucks on which beat for the basic p, i, m, a pattern.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Finger-to-String Assignment Sheet:
   - A diagram of guitar strings with blank spaces for students to fill in the correct finger assignments.

2. Alternating Bass Exercise:
   - Tablature showing the alternating bass pattern for A, D, and E chords.
   - Space for students to write in the finger (p) and string numbers.

3. Basic Fingerpicking Pattern Practice:
   - A series of empty grids where students can create their own fingerpicking patterns using p, i, m, a.

4. Simple Timorese Melody Sheet:
   - Tablature of a simple Timorese melody adapted for fingerpicking practice.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Online video tutorials on basic fingerpicking techniques.
2. A list of simple songs suitable for beginner fingerpicking practice.
3. Audio recordings of various fingerpicking patterns at different speeds.
4. A guide to common fingerpicking patterns in Timorese music.
5. Recommended books on fingerstyle guitar for beginners.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with finger independence.
   - **Solution**: Encourage slow, deliberate practice. Introduce exercises that isolate individual finger movements.

2. **Challenge**: Maintaining a steady rhythm while fingerpicking.
   - **Solution**: Use a metronome set at a very slow tempo. Gradually increase speed as students become more comfortable.

3. **Challenge**: Students experiencing hand fatigue.
   - **Solution**: Ensure proper hand positioning. Encourage frequent breaks and stretching exercises.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty transitioning between chords while fingerpicking.
   - **Solution**: Practice chord transitions separately before incorporating fingerpicking. Use simpler chord shapes initially.

5. **Challenge**: Students becoming frustrated with complex patterns.
   - **Solution**: Break down patterns into smaller segments. Celebrate small victories and emphasize gradual progress.

6. **Challenge**: Adapting fingerpicking techniques to Timorese melodies.
   - **Solution**: Start with very simple, familiar melodies. Gradually introduce more complex Timorese songs as skills improve.
