# Lesson Plan: Rhythm and Timing

## 1. Resources Needed

- Acoustic guitars (1 per student or shared)
- Metronome or metronome app
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with time signature examples
- Audio recordings of Timorese songs in 4/4 and 3/4 time

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the concept of time signatures
- Count beats in 4/4 and 3/4 time
- Tap out rhythms of simple Timorese songs
- Strum basic chord progressions in different time signatures

## 3. Warm-up Activity (5 minutes)

- Students clap along to the beat of a popular Timorese song
- Instructor gradually increases and decreases tempo to challenge students

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain:
- Time signature
- Measure
- Beat
- Downbeat
- Upbeat

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)

1. Explain time signatures:
   - What they represent (beats per measure)
   - How to read them (top number = beats per measure, bottom number = note value that gets one beat)

2. Introduce 4/4 time:
   - Also known as "common time"
   - Count "1, 2, 3, 4" repeatedly
   - Demonstrate with simple strumming pattern on guitar

3. Introduce 3/4 time:
   - Also known as "waltz time"
   - Count "1, 2, 3" repeatedly
   - Demonstrate with simple strumming pattern on guitar

4. Show how time signatures appear in written music

## 6. Practice Activities (25 minutes)

1. Counting practice:
   - Students count out loud in 4/4 time while instructor plays guitar
   - Repeat for 3/4 time

2. Tapping rhythms:
   - Play short clips of Timorese songs in 4/4 and 3/4 time
   - Students tap along on their legs, identifying the time signature

3. Strumming practice:
   - Students practice strumming A and D chords in 4/4 time (4 downstrums per measure)
   - Switch to 3/4 time (3 downstrums per measure)

## 7. Production Tasks (20 minutes)

1. Small group activity:
   - Divide class into groups of 3-4
   - Each group chooses a simple Timorese song
   - Groups identify the time signature and practice playing/strumming along

2. Performance:
   - Each group performs their song for the class
   - Other students identify the time signature and tap along

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (5 minutes)

- Recap key points about time signatures
- Address any questions from students
- Preview next lesson's topic

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Practice strumming A, D, and E chords in both 4/4 and 3/4 time for 15 minutes daily
- Find two Timorese songs: one in 4/4 time and one in 3/4 time
- Write down the names of the songs and practice tapping along to the beat

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Time signature: A notational convention that specifies how many beats are in each measure and what note value constitutes one beat
- Measure: A segment of time in music corresponding to a specific number of beats
- Beat: The basic unit of time in music
- Downbeat: The first beat of a measure, typically emphasized
- Upbeat: Any non-accented beat in a measure, particularly the last beat before a downbeat
