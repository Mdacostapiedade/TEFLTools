# Lecture Notes

## Time Signatures

- Definition: A time signature is a notational convention in Western musical notation that specifies how many beats are in each measure and what note value constitutes one beat.
- Format: Two numbers stacked vertically
  - Top number: How many beats per measure
  - Bottom number: Which note value gets one beat (4 = quarter note, 8 = eighth note, etc.)
- Common time signatures:
  - 4/4 (Common Time): 4 beats per measure, quarter note gets one beat
  - 3/4 (Waltz Time): 3 beats per measure, quarter note gets one beat
- Purpose: Helps musicians stay coordinated and understand the rhythmic structure of a piece

## 4/4 Time

- Also known as "Common Time"
- Can be represented by a C symbol in notation
- Counted as "1, 2, 3, 4" repeatedly
- Emphasis typically on beats 1 and 3
- Examples in Timorese music: [Insert specific song examples]

## 3/4 Time

- Also known as "Waltz Time"
- Counted as "1, 2, 3" repeatedly
- Strong emphasis on beat 1
- Creates a lilting, dance-like feel
- Examples in Timorese music: [Insert specific song examples]

## Counting Beats and Measures

- Importance of consistent counting
- Techniques for counting aloud while playing
- Using a metronome to maintain steady tempo
- Subdividing beats for more complex rhythms

## Strumming Patterns in Different Time Signatures

- 4/4 Time basic pattern: Down, Down, Up, Down, Up
- 3/4 Time basic pattern: Down, Down, Down
- Importance of emphasizing the downbeat
- Variations and more complex patterns

# Discussion Questions

1. How does understanding time signatures help you as a musician?
2. Can you think of any traditional Timorese songs that use 3/4 time? How does the rhythm feel different from songs in 4/4 time?
3. Why do you think 4/4 time is so common in popular music?
4. How might you use your knowledge of time signatures when writing your own music?
5. In what ways can changing the time signature alter the feel or mood of a song?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

1. Listen to three different Timorese songs and try to identify their time signatures. Write a short paragraph for each song describing:
   - The title and artist of the song
   - The time signature you believe it uses
   - How you determined the time signature
   - How the rhythm makes you feel or want to move

2. Create a simple rhythm in 4/4 time and another in 3/4 time. Write them down using standard notation or a system of your own devising. Explain how each rhythm differs and what mood or style of music it might suit.

# Assignment Details

## Rhythm Identification and Practice

1. Find two Timorese songs: one in 4/4 time and one in 3/4 time.
2. Write down the names of the songs and their artists.
3. Practice tapping along to the beat of each song for at least 5 minutes daily.
4. In your practice journal, note:
   - Any difficulties you encountered in keeping time
   - How the rhythm of each song makes you feel
   - Any observations about how the time signature affects the song's mood or style

## Strumming Practice

1. Practice strumming A, D, and E chords in both 4/4 and 3/4 time for 15 minutes daily.
2. Use the following patterns:
   - 4/4 Time: Down, Down, Up, Down, Up
   - 3/4 Time: Down, Down, Down
3. Start slowly with a metronome and gradually increase speed as you become more comfortable.
4. In your practice journal, record:
   - Your starting and ending tempos each day
   - Any challenges you faced
   - How your comfort level changed over the week

   - In 4/4 time: Clap on beats 1 and 3, tap your leg on beats 2 and 4
   - In 3/4 time: Clap on beat 1, tap your leg on beats 2 and 3

2. Vocal Rhythm:
   - In 4/4 time: Say "Ta" on beats 1 and 3, "Ki" on beats 2 and 4
   - In 3/4 time: Say "Boom" on beat 1, "Chick-Chick" on beats 2 and 3

3. Body Percussion:
   - In 4/4 time: Stomp, Clap, Snap, Clap
