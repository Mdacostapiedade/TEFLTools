# Lesson Plan: Song Structure and Performance

## Resources Needed
- Acoustic guitars (1 per 2-3 students)
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with chord charts and lyrics for a simple Timorese song
- Audio recording of the chosen Timorese song
- Small portable speaker

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify the basic parts of a song structure (verse, chorus, bridge)
2. Analyze the structure of a simple Timorese song
3. Demonstrate basic performance techniques and stage presence
4. Perform a simple song for the class

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Students form a circle and pass a guitar around
- Each student plays one chord and says its name
- Increase speed as students become more comfortable

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)
Write and explain the following terms on the whiteboard:
- Verse

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)
1. Explain the basic song structure:
   - Verse: Tells the story, lyrics change each time
   - Chorus: Repeats, often catchier than verse
   - Bridge: Contrasts with verse and chorus, occurs once or twice

2. Play a recording of a simple Timorese song and analyze its structure together
   - Identify verses, chorus, and bridge (if present)
   - Discuss how the parts differ musically and lyrically

3. Demonstrate basic performance techniques:
   - Proper posture while standing
   - Eye contact with audience
   - Confident strumming and singing
   - Recovering from mistakes

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)
1. Group activity: Divide class into small groups
   - Each group analyzes the structure of a different Timorese song
   - Groups present their findings to the class

2. Individual practice:
   - Students practice the chosen simple Timorese song
   - Focus on transitions between song parts and maintaining rhythm

## Production Task (30 minutes)
- Students perform the practiced song in pairs or small groups
- Encourage use of proper performance techniques
- Provide constructive feedback after each performance

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
- Recap the main points of song structure
- Discuss common performance challenges and solutions
- Quick Q&A session

## Homework Assignment
1. Analyze the structure of a favorite song (Timorese or international)
2. Practice the performed song, focusing on smooth transitions and stage presence
3. Write a short reflection on personal strengths and areas for improvement in performance
