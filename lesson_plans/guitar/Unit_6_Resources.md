# Lecture Notes

## Song Structure

### Verse
- Typically tells the story or conveys the main message of the song
- Lyrics usually change with each repetition
- Melody often remains consistent across verses
- Generally more subdued than the chorus

### Chorus
- Contains the main hook or message of the song
- Lyrics and melody repeat with each occurrence
- Often more energetic or catchy than the verse
- Usually the most memorable part of the song

### Bridge
- Provides contrast to both verse and chorus
- Often has a different chord progression or melody
- Typically occurs once or twice in a song
- Serves to break up repetition and add interest

### Examples in Timorese Music
- "Kolele Mai" structure:
  * Verse 1 - Chorus - Verse 2 - Chorus - Bridge - Chorus
- "Rai Doben" structure:
  * Intro - Verse 1 - Chorus - Verse 2 - Chorus - Bridge - Chorus

## Performance Techniques

### Posture
- Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
- Keep shoulders relaxed and back straight
- Hold guitar at a comfortable angle

### Eye Contact
- Scan the audience, making brief eye contact with individuals
- Avoid staring at the ground or your instrument
- Use eye contact to engage with your audience

### Confidence
- Project your voice clearly
- Use deliberate, purposeful movements
- Smile and show enjoyment in your performance

### Recovering from Mistakes
- Keep playing if you make a small error
- If you lose your place, return to the chorus or a familiar part
- Maintain a positive expression; most audiences won't notice small mistakes
