## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggle with identifying song parts
   - Solution: Use color-coding on lyric sheets to visually distinguish verses, choruses, and bridges

2. Challenge: Shy students hesitate to perform
   - Solution: Start with small group performances and gradually move to individual performances

3. Challenge: Students have difficulty maintaining rhythm during transitions
   - Solution: Practice transitions separately, using a metronome to keep steady time

4. Challenge: Limited number of guitars for practice
   - Solution: Implement a rotation system and encourage peer teaching during individual practice time

5. Challenge: Students forget lyrics during performance
   - Solution: Allow students to use lyric sheets during initial performances, gradually removing this support as they gain confidence

6. Challenge: Maintaining student engagement during others' performances
   - Solution: Assign specific aspects for non-performing students to observe and provide constructive feedback on
