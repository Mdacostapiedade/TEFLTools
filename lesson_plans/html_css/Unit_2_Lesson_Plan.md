# Lesson Plan: Advanced HTML and Document Structure

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with internet access and a modern web browser
- Text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- Projector or large screen for demonstrations
- HTML5 cheat sheet handouts
- WCAG 2.1 quick reference guide

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify and use semantic HTML5 elements correctly
- Create accessible and well-structured web forms
- Understand and apply basic web accessibility principles

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide the class into small groups
- Each group brainstorms 5-10 different types of content found on websites (e.g., navigation, articles, forms)
- Groups share their lists, discussing how these content types might be structured in HTML

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

- Semantic HTML
- Accessibility
- ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
- Form validation
- Input types

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Semantic HTML5 Elements
- Explain the purpose and importance of semantic HTML
- Demonstrate the use of `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`
- Show before and after examples of non-semantic vs. semantic markup

### Forms and Input Types
- Review basic form structure (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`)
- Introduce new HTML5 input types (e.g., date, email, tel)
- Demonstrate form validation attributes (required, pattern)

### Accessibility Considerations
- Introduce WCAG and its importance
- Discuss key accessibility principles (perceivable, operable, understandable, robust)
- Show examples of accessible markup (e.g., proper heading structure, alt text for images)

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### Activity 1: Semantic Markup Conversion
- Provide students with a non-semantic HTML document
- Task: Convert the document to use appropriate semantic HTML5 elements
- Review and discuss solutions as a class

### Activity 2: Accessible Form Creation
- Students create a registration form for a Timorese cultural event
- Requirements: Use appropriate input types, include form validation, ensure accessibility

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

- Students begin work on their multi-page website project for a local Timorese business
- Focus on implementing semantic structure and accessible forms
- Instructor circulates to provide guidance and answer questions

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz on semantic elements and their purposes
- Class discussion: How can semantic HTML and accessibility improve websites in Timor Leste?

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Complete the multi-page website project started in class
2. Conduct an accessibility audit of a popular Timorese website:
   - Choose a well-known Timorese website
   - Use the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool to assess the site
   - Write a brief report on findings and suggestions for improvement

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- **Semantic HTML**: Markup that uses HTML elements to convey the meaning of the content, not just its appearance
- **Accessibility**: The practice of making websites usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities
- **ARIA**: A set of attributes that define ways to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities
- **Form validation**: The process of ensuring that user input on a form is complete and formatted correctly
- **Input types**: Different varieties of form input fields in HTML5, such as date, email, and tel, which provide built-in validation and appropriate mobile keyboards
