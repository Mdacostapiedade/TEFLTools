- **Value**: The setting you specify for a property
- **Declaration**: A property and its value together
- **Rule set**: A selector and its declarations
- **Box model**: A design concept that treats HTML elements as boxes with content, padding, borders, and margins
- **External stylesheet**: A separate CSS file linked to an HTML document
- **Internal styles**: CSS rules placed within the `<style>` tag in the HTML document's `<head>`
- **Inline styles**: CSS applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute
- **Web-safe fonts**: Fonts that are commonly available across different operating systems
- **Font stack**: A list of fonts in order of preference for fallback purposes

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

   selector {
     property: value;
     property: value;
   }
   ```

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with CSS syntax
   - Tip: Provide a syntax reference sheet and encourage use of code editors with syntax highlighting

2. Challenge: Difficulty understanding the cascade and specificity
   - Tip: Use visual metaphors (e.g., water cascade) and provide exercises that demonstrate specificity in action

3. Challenge: Confusion about the box model
   - Tip: Use physical boxes or draw on the whiteboard to demonstrate how padding, borders, and margins interact

4. Challenge: Trouble visualizing color combinations
   - Tip: Use online color palette tools and provide physical color swatches for hands-on exploration

5. Challenge: Difficulty linking CSS to HTML correctly
   - Tip: Create a troubleshooting checklist for common linking errors and demonstrate using browser developer tools

6. Challenge: Overwhelmed by the number of CSS properties
   - Tip: Focus on a core set of properties initially and gradually introduce more as students become comfortable

7. Challenge: Lack of design skills affecting CSS choices
   - Tip: Provide design principles handouts and encourage analysis of well-designed websites

8. Challenge: Cultural relevance in examples and exercises
   - Tip: Collaborate with local artists or cultural experts to incorporate authentic Timorese design elements
