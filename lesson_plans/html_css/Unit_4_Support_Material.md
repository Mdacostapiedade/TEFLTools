   - Icons representing different devices at each breakpoint.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with the concept of flex-direction.
   - Tip: Use a physical analogy, like a bookshelf. Books can be arranged vertically (column) or horizontally (row).

2. Challenge: Confusion between flexbox and grid use cases.
   - Tip: Emphasize that flexbox is primarily for one-dimensional layouts, while grid is for two-dimensional layouts. Provide examples of when to use each.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in understanding media queries.
   - Tip: Start with a single breakpoint and gradually introduce more. Use the browser's responsive design mode to demonstrate in real-time.

4. Challenge: Overwhelmed by CSS framework options.
   - Tip: Focus on one framework (Bootstrap) and its core components. Encourage exploration of others as an extension activity.

5. Challenge: Incorporating Timorese design elements.
   - Tip: Provide a curated collection of Timorese patterns, colors, and imagery. Discuss how these can be applied to web design principles.

6. Challenge: Students at different skill levels.
   - Tip: Prepare additional, more complex exercises for advanced students. Pair struggling students with more confident ones for peer learning.
