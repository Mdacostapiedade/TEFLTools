# Lecture Notes

## Project Planning and Wireframing

### Introduction to Project Planning
- Importance of planning in web development
- Key components of a project plan:
  * Project scope
  * Timeline
  * Resources needed
  * Milestones and deliverables

### Wireframing
- Definition: A visual guide representing the skeletal framework of a website
- Purpose: To arrange elements to best accomplish a particular purpose
- Types of wireframes:
  * Low-fidelity
  * Mid-fidelity
  * High-fidelity

### Wireframing Tools
- Pen and paper (quick and easy)
- Digital tools:
  * Balsamiq
  * Figma
  * Adobe XD
  * Sketch

### Best Practices for Wireframing
1. Keep it simple
2. Use a grid system
3. Focus on layout, not design details
4. Consider user flow
5. Include annotations for clarity

## Version Control with Git

### Introduction to Version Control
- Definition: System that records changes to files over time
- Benefits:
  * Track changes
  * Collaborate with others
  * Revert to previous versions

### Git Basics
- What is Git?
  * Distributed version control system
  * Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005
- Key concepts:
  * Repository
  * Commit
  * Branch
  * Merge

### Essential Git Commands
1. `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository
2. `git add`: Stage changes for commit
3. `git commit`: Save changes to the repository
4. `git push`: Upload local changes to a remote repository
5. `git pull`: Download changes from a remote repository
6. `git clone`: Create a local copy of a remote repository

### Git Workflow
1. Create or clone a repository
2. Make changes to files
3. Stage changes
4. Commit changes
5. Push changes to remote repository

## Hosting and Domain Concepts

### Web Hosting
- Definition: Service that allows websites to be accessible via the internet
- Types of hosting:
  * Shared hosting
  * VPS (Virtual Private Server)
  * Dedicated hosting
  * Cloud hosting

### Domain Names
- Definition: The address where internet users can access your website
- Structure: [subdomain].[domain].[top-level domain]
- Registering a domain name:
  * Choose a registrar
  * Check availability
  * Purchase and register

### DNS (Domain Name System)
- Purpose: Translates domain names to IP addresses
- Key DNS records:
  * A Record
  * CNAME
  * MX Record

### Hosting Options for Timor Leste
- Local hosting providers
- International hosting services
- Considerations for choosing a host:
  * Server location
  * Bandwidth and storage
  * Customer support
  * Cost

- Free hosting service provided by GitHub
- Suitable for static websites
- Automatically integrated with Git repositories

### Setting Up GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub account
2. Create a new repository or use an existing one
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Choose a branch to deploy from (usually `main` or `gh-pages`)

### Deploying a Website
1. Push your HTML, CSS, and other assets to the chosen branch
2. GitHub automatically builds and deploys your site
3. Access your site at `https://[username].github.io/[repository]`

### Custom Domains with GitHub Pages
1. Purchase a domain name
2. Add a CNAME file to your repository
3. Configure DNS settings with your domain registrar
4. Update GitHub Pages settings with your custom domain
