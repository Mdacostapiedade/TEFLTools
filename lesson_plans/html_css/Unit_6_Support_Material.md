## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Limited Internet Connectivity**:
   - Prepare offline resources and documentation
   - Encourage students to download necessary software and materials in advance
   - Consider setting up a local Git server for practice

2. **Varying Skill Levels**:
   - Provide additional support materials for beginners
   - Pair more experienced students with beginners for peer learning
   - Offer optional advanced tasks for faster learners

3. **Language Barriers**:
   - Provide key terms in both English and Tetum
   - Use visual aids and demonstrations to supplement verbal explanations
   - Encourage students to create a class glossary of technical terms

4. **Limited Access to Computers**:
   - Organize group work to maximize computer usage
   - Provide paper-based activities for wireframing and project planning
   - Consider setting up a computer lab schedule outside of class time

5. **Difficulty Understanding Abstract Concepts**:
   - Use real-world analogies to explain version control and hosting
   - Provide hands-on exercises to reinforce theoretical concepts
   - Create visual representations of abstract processes

6. **Lack of Familiarity with Local Web Development Scene**:
   - Invite local web developers as guest speakers
   - Organize field trips to local tech companies or events
   - Encourage students to research and present on local web development projects

By addressing these challenges proactively, you can ensure a more effective and inclusive learning experience for all students in the context of Timor Leste.
