## Defining Indigenous Knowledge and Sustainable Urban Design

### Indigenous Knowledge
- Traditional knowledge, practices, and beliefs of Indigenous peoples
- Passed down through generations orally and through cultural practices
- Holistic understanding of the environment, society, and spirituality

- Includes knowledge of plants, animals, weather patterns, and land management

### Sustainable Urban Design
- Creation of urban environments that meet present needs without compromising future generations
- Incorporates environmental, social, and economic sustainability
- Key principles:
  * Energy efficiency and renewable energy use
  * Water conservation and management
  * Waste reduction and recycling
  * Green spaces and biodiversity
  * Walkable communities and public transportation
  * Preservation of cultural heritage
  * Social equity and inclusivity

### Intersection of Indigenous Knowledge and Sustainable Urban Design
- Incorporating traditional ecological knowledge into urban planning
- Respecting and preserving Indigenous cultural sites in urban areas
- Designing spaces that reflect Indigenous values and social structures
- Using traditional building materials and techniques when appropriate
- Engaging Indigenous communities in the planning and decision-making process

## Overview of Timorese Urban History and Development
