2. What role should lia nain and traditional governance structures play in modern urban planning processes?
3. How can the spiritual significance of land (rai na'in concept) be respected in urban development projects?
4. In what ways can uma lulik inspire the design of public buildings or community centers in Timorese cities?
5. How might tara bandu practices be incorporated into urban environmental management strategies?
6. What challenges arise when trying to balance modernization with traditional Timorese spatial concepts in urban areas?
7. How can gender-specific traditional spaces be reinterpreted in a modern, equitable urban context?
8. What lessons can be learned from the case studies presented about integrating cultural values into urban planning?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Cultural Design Principles for Timorese Urban Contexts

1. Based on the lecture content, class discussions, and your interview with an elder, identify 5-7 key Timorese cultural values or concepts relevant to urban planning.

2. For each value or concept, write a brief explanation (2-3 sentences) of its significance in traditional Timorese culture.

3. Develop a design principle for each value or concept that could be applied in urban planning. Explain how this principle translates the traditional value into a practical guideline for urban design.

4. Provide a specific example of how each design principle could be implemented in an urban Timorese context (e.g., in housing design, public space layout, or community facilities).

5. Create a visual representation of your cultural design principles. This could be a poster, infographic, or digital presentation that clearly communicates the principles and their applications.

6. Write a brief reflection (200-300 words) on the process of developing these principles and any challenges you encountered in translating traditional concepts to modern urban contexts.

# Additional Materials

## Excerpt from "Traditional Architecture in Timor-Leste" by Cinatti, Almeida, and Mendes

"The uma lulik, or sacred house, stands at the heart of Timorese social and spiritual life. Its structure embodies the cosmology of the community, with each element representing a facet of Timorese worldview. The central post, or kakuluk, connects the earthly realm to the spiritual world above, while the elevated floor separates the sacred space from the profane ground below. The orientation of the house, typically east-west, aligns with the path of the sun and the flow of life force believed to move through the landscape."
