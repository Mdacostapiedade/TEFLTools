## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language barriers**: 
   - Challenge: Some Timorese terms may be difficult for non-native speakers to pronounce or understand.
   - Solution: Provide phonetic pronunciations and practice key terms as a class. Use visual aids to reinforce meanings.

2. **Cultural sensitivity**: 
   - Challenge: Discussing sacred or traditional concepts may require special consideration.
   - Solution: Establish ground rules for respectful discussion. Invite a local cultural advisor to guide sensitive topics.

3. **Limited urban planning resources in Timor-Leste**: 
   - Challenge: Finding Timor-Leste-specific urban planning materials may be difficult.
   - Solution: Supplement with case studies from other Southeast Asian countries with similar cultural contexts. Encourage students to create original resources through their research.

4. **Bridging traditional and modern concepts**: 
   - Challenge: Students may struggle to connect traditional values with modern urban planning principles.
   - Solution: Use plenty of real-world examples and case studies. Facilitate discussions on how traditional principles can be reinterpreted in contemporary contexts.

5. **Engaging students with diverse backgrounds**: 
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of familiarity with Timorese culture and urban planning concepts.
   - Solution: Use pair and group work to encourage peer learning. Provide additional background readings for those less familiar with the context.
