## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited experience interacting with elders in a professional context.
   **Solution**: Provide role-playing exercises and guidance on respectful communication with elders. Invite a community elder to speak to the class about appropriate engagement.

2. **Challenge**: Balancing traditional knowledge with modern urban planning principles.
   **Solution**: Emphasize the complementary nature of both knowledge systems. Use case studies that demonstrate successful integration of traditional and modern approaches.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to envision how intergenerational perspectives can be practically applied in urban planning.
   **Solution**: Provide concrete examples of successful intergenerational urban projects. Organize a field trip to a local project that incorporates elder wisdom in its design.

4. **Challenge**: Ensuring active participation from all students in group activities.
   **Solution**: Assign specific roles within groups to ensure everyone contributes. Rotate roles in subsequent activities to give students experience in different aspects of the planning process.

5. **Challenge**: Overcoming language barriers when engaging with community elders.
   **Solution**: Partner with local translators or encourage bilingual students to assist. Provide key vocabulary in both Tetum and English.

6. **Challenge**: Students may lack confidence in their ability to organize community forums or conduct interviews.
   **Solution**: Provide detailed guidelines and practice sessions in class. Consider partnering students with local community organizations for mentorship and support.
