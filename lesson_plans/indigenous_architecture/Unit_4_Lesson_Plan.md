# Lesson Plan: Sustainable Housing for Urban Timorese Communities

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts with images of traditional and contemporary Timorese housing
- Materials for housing design activity (paper, pencils, rulers, etc.)
- Transportation for site visit
- Guest speaker from local housing organization

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify key features of traditional Timorese housing
- Analyze contemporary urban housing challenges in Timor-Leste
- Apply sustainable building techniques appropriate for the local climate and resources
- Design a culturally-appropriate and sustainable housing prototype

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Students share their experiences with different types of housing in Timor-Leste, discussing what they like or dislike about various housing styles they've encountered.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Uma lulik (sacred house)
- Vernacular architecture
- Thermal mass
- Passive cooling
- Sustainable materials

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Traditional Timorese Housing
- Overview of uma lulik and its cultural significance
- Common materials and construction techniques
- Adaptation to local climate and environment

### Contemporary Urban Housing Challenges
- Rapid urbanization and housing shortages
- Informal settlements and land tenure issues
- Loss of cultural identity in urban housing

### Sustainable Building Techniques
- Passive design strategies for tropical climates
- Local, sustainable building materials
- Water and energy conservation methods

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

Students work in small groups to analyze images of both traditional and contemporary Timorese housing, identifying positive and negative aspects of each in terms of sustainability, cultural appropriateness, and practicality.

## 7. Production Task (1 hour)

Students begin designing a sustainable housing prototype that incorporates Timorese cultural elements. They should consider:
- Cultural significance and symbolism
- Climate-appropriate design
- Use of local, sustainable materials
- Space for traditional activities and family structures

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

Class discussion on the challenges and opportunities in designing culturally-appropriate, sustainable urban housing for Timor-Leste. Recap key points from the lesson.

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will complete their housing prototype designs and prepare a short presentation explaining their design choices, focusing on how they've incorporated cultural elements and sustainable techniques.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Uma lulik: Sacred house in Timorese culture, traditionally used for ceremonies and storing ancestral objects
- Vernacular architecture: Building style based on local needs, materials, and traditions
