# Lecture Notes

## Traditional Timorese Housing

### Uma Lulik (Sacred House)
- Central to Timorese culture and spirituality
- Rectangular structure with steep, pitched roof
- Often built on stilts
- Used for ceremonies, storing ancestral objects, and community gatherings
- Symbolizes connection between living and ancestors

### Common Materials and Construction Techniques
- Timber frame construction
- Thatched roofing using palm leaves or grass
- Woven bamboo walls
- Elevated floors made of bamboo or wooden planks
- Natural binding materials (e.g., rattan)

### Adaptation to Local Climate and Environment
- Raised floors for ventilation and protection from flooding
- Steep roofs for quick rainwater runoff
- Porous walls allow for natural ventilation
- Use of locally available, renewable materials

## Contemporary Urban Housing Challenges

### Rapid Urbanization and Housing Shortages
- Migration from rural areas to cities, especially Dili
- Insufficient housing stock to meet growing demand
- Overcrowding in existing urban areas

### Informal Settlements and Land Tenure Issues
- Growth of informal settlements (slums) on urban fringes
- Lack of basic infrastructure and services
- Unclear land ownership and tenure rights
- Risk of forced evictions

### Loss of Cultural Identity in Urban Housing
- Shift towards concrete block construction
- Adoption of Western-style housing designs
- Reduced space for traditional activities and extended family living
- Disconnection from traditional building practices and materials

## Sustainable Building Techniques

### Passive Design Strategies for Tropical Climates
- Building orientation to minimize solar heat gain
- Natural ventilation through cross-ventilation and stack effect
- Shading devices (overhangs, louvers, vegetation)
- High ceilings and open plan layouts for air circulation

### Local, Sustainable Building Materials
- Bamboo: fast-growing, strong, versatile
- Earth blocks: low embodied energy, good thermal mass
- Recycled materials: reducing waste and resource consumption
- Local timber: when sourced sustainably

### Water and Energy Conservation Methods
- Rainwater harvesting systems
- Greywater recycling for irrigation
- Solar panels for electricity generation
- Solar water heating
- Energy-efficient appliances and lighting

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay comparing and contrasting traditional Timorese housing with contemporary urban housing in Timor-Leste. Consider the following aspects:

1. Cultural significance and symbolism
2. Adaptation to local climate and environment
3. Use of materials and construction techniques
4. Spatial organization and family living patterns
5. Sustainability and resource efficiency

In your conclusion, propose ways to integrate positive aspects of traditional housing into modern urban designs while addressing contemporary challenges.

# Assignment Details

## Sustainable Housing Prototype Design

Design a sustainable housing prototype for an urban Timorese family, incorporating cultural elements and sustainable building techniques. Your design should include:

1. Floor plan (scale 1:50)
2. Elevations (front and side)
3. Section drawing showing key sustainable features
4. Materials list with justification for choices
5. Written explanation (500 words) detailing:
   - How the design reflects Timorese cultural values
   - Sustainable features and their benefits
   - Adaptations for urban living and modern needs
   - Potential challenges in implementation and proposed solutions

Submit your design drawings and written explanation as a single PDF file.
