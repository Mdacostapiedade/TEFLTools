Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Sustainable Housing for Urban Timorese Communities, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Sustainable Housing Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Uma lulik**: Sacred house in Timorese culture, traditionally used for ceremonies and storing ancestral objects
- **Vernacular architecture**: Building style based on local needs, materials, and traditions
- **Thermal mass**: Material's capacity to absorb, store, and release heat
- **Passive cooling**: Cooling a building without mechanical systems, using natural energy flows
- **Sustainable materials**: Building materials that are renewable or have low environmental impact
- **Urbanization**: The process of population shift from rural to urban areas
- **Informal settlements**: Unplanned housing areas, often lacking basic infrastructure
- **Land tenure**: The legal regime under which land is owned or occupied
- **Cultural identity**: The characteristics and heritage that define a particular group or community

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Diagram: "Traditional Timorese Uma Lulik Structure"
   - A simple line drawing showing the key structural elements of a traditional uma lulik, including the elevated floor, steep roof, and central post.

2. Infographic: "Sustainable Building Techniques for Tropical Climates"
   - Visual representation of passive cooling methods, including cross-ventilation, shading, and thermal mass, with arrows indicating air flow and heat absorption/release.

3. Comparison Chart: "Traditional vs. Contemporary Urban Housing in Timor-Leste"
   - Side-by-side images or sketches highlighting the differences in materials, design, and cultural elements between traditional and modern urban housing.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Housing Analysis Worksheet
   - Table with columns for "Housing Type," "Positive Aspects," and "Negative Aspects"
   - Space for students to sketch or describe different housing examples
   - Prompts for considering sustainability, cultural appropriateness, and practicality

2. Sustainable Housing Design Checklist
   - List of key considerations for students to reference while designing their prototypes:
     * Cultural elements incorporated
     * Sustainable materials used
     * Passive cooling strategies
     * Water conservation methods
     * Energy efficiency features
     * Adaptability to family structures
     * Space for traditional activities

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may have limited exposure to traditional housing.
   - Solution: Organize a field trip to a traditional village or invite a local elder to share experiences and knowledge about uma lulik.

2. Challenge: Balancing modern needs with traditional design elements.
   - Solution: Encourage students to think creatively about how traditional elements can be adapted for contemporary use. Provide examples of successful integrations from other cultures.

3. Challenge: Limited understanding of sustainable building techniques.
   - Solution: Use hands-on demonstrations or simple experiments to illustrate concepts like thermal mass and passive cooling.

4. Challenge: Difficulty in visualizing 3D designs on paper.
   - Solution: If possible, provide basic 3D modeling software or encourage the use of simple model-making materials for prototype designs.

5. Challenge: Varying levels of cultural knowledge among students.
   - Solution: Implement peer teaching strategies, pairing students with different backgrounds to share knowledge and perspectives.

6. Challenge: Addressing sensitive issues around land tenure and informal settlements.
   - Solution: Approach these topics with sensitivity, focusing on solutions and empowerment rather than problems. Invite guest speakers from relevant organizations to provide context and current initiatives.
