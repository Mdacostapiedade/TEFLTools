   **Solution**: Discuss real-world case studies that successfully integrate traditional and modern elements, emphasizing adaptability.

4. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to critique existing public spaces.
   **Solution**: Provide a structured analysis framework and encourage constructive, solution-oriented feedback.

5. **Challenge**: Limited access to traditional materials or objects for demonstration.
   **Solution**: Use digital resources, photos, or create replicas of traditional objects using available materials.
