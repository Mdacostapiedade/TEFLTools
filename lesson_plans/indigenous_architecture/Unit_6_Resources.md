# Lecture Notes

## Traditional Timorese Agricultural Practices and Plant Knowledge

### Shifting Cultivation Systems
- Definition: Agricultural system where areas of land are cultivated temporarily, then abandoned and allowed to revert to their natural vegetation while the cultivator moves to another plot
- Locally known as "to'os"
- Typical cycle: 2-3 years cultivation, followed by 4-7 years fallow
- Crops: Maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, taro, beans, pumpkins
- Benefits: Soil regeneration, pest control, biodiversity maintenance
- Challenges in urban contexts: Limited space, shorter fallow periods

### Intercropping Techniques
- Definition: Growing two or more crops in proximity to produce a greater yield on a given piece of land
- Common combinations: 
  * Maize + beans + squash (Three Sisters method)
  * Coffee + shade trees + food crops
- Benefits: Improved soil fertility, pest control, maximized land use
- Adaptation for urban settings: Vertical gardening, companion planting in small spaces

### Sacred Groves and Forest Management
- Tara bandu: Traditional Timorese practice of setting prohibitions on natural resource use
- Lulik (sacred) forests: Protected areas with cultural and ecological significance
- Role in urban contexts: Green spaces, community gardens, preserving biodiversity

### Medicinal Plants and Traditional Healing
- Common medicinal plants: Noni (Morinda citrifolia), Papaya (Carica papaya), Aloe vera
- Traditional healers (matan-dook) role in plant knowledge preservation
- Potential for medicinal gardens in urban areas

## Benefits of Urban Agriculture in Timor-Leste

### Food Security and Nutrition
- Addressing urban poverty and malnutrition
- Reducing dependence on imported foods
- Improving access to fresh, nutritious produce

### Cultural Preservation
- Maintaining traditional agricultural knowledge in urban settings
- Intergenerational knowledge transfer
- Strengthening community bonds through shared gardening practices

### Environmental Sustainability
- Reducing urban heat island effect
- Improving air quality and biodiversity
- Managing organic waste through composting
- Enhancing urban water management through rainwater harvesting

## Challenges of Implementing Urban Agriculture

### Land Access and Tenure Issues
- Limited available space in dense urban areas
- Unclear land ownership and use rights
- Competition with other urban development priorities

### Water Scarcity
- Seasonal water shortages in Timor-Leste
- Need for efficient irrigation systems
- Potential for rainwater harvesting and greywater reuse

### Soil Contamination in Urban Areas
- Risks from previous land uses (e.g., industrial sites)
- Need for soil testing and remediation techniques
- Use of raised beds and container gardening as alternatives

### Policy and Regulatory Challenges
- Lack of supportive urban planning policies
- Zoning restrictions on agricultural activities
- Need for advocacy and policy development

## Designing Productive Urban Landscapes Using Indigenous Knowledge

### Principles of Permaculture and Traditional Timorese Agriculture
- Mimicking natural ecosystems
- Maximizing diversity and resilience
- Efficient use of vertical space and microclimates

### Integrating Cultural Elements in Urban Garden Design
- Incorporating sacred plants and spaces
- Designing for community gatherings and rituals
- Using traditional materials and structures (e.g., bamboo trellises)

### Strategies for Small-Scale Urban Food Production
- Rooftop gardens and green walls
- Community allotments and shared gardens
- Fruit trees in public spaces and along streets

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Essay: Traditional Ecological Knowledge in Urban Contexts

Write a 1000-word reflective essay exploring the following question:

"How can traditional ecological knowledge be effectively integrated into urban agriculture initiatives in Timor-Leste?"

Your essay should:
- Draw on the concepts and examples discussed in class
- Incorporate insights from your field visit and elder interview
- Consider both the opportunities and challenges of applying traditional knowledge in urban settings
- Propose at least one specific strategy or project that could be implemented in a Timorese city
- Reflect on the potential impact of such initiatives on urban sustainability and cultural preservation

Structure your essay with a clear introduction, body paragraphs exploring different aspects of the topic, and a conclusion summarizing your key insights and recommendations.

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Kano City Walls Urban Agriculture Project, Nigeria

This case study examines a successful urban agriculture initiative in Kano, Nigeria, which incorporated traditional Hausa agricultural practices into the restoration and utilization of the ancient city walls. Key elements include:

- Use of traditional terracing techniques
- Integration of indigenous crop varieties
- Community management system based on traditional land use practices
- Educational programs linking elders with youth

Students should read the full case study (provided separately) and consider how similar approaches might be applied in the Timorese context.
