## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may have limited understanding of Indigenous perspectives.
   - Solution: Invite local Indigenous elders or community leaders as guest speakers to provide first-hand insights.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in accessing up-to-date data on urban inequities in Timor-Leste.
   - Solution: Encourage students to conduct small-scale surveys or interviews in their communities to gather current information.

3. Challenge: Students may struggle to balance cultural sensitivity with modern urban planning principles.
   - Solution: Facilitate discussions on how to integrate traditional knowledge with contemporary sustainable design practices.

4. Challenge: Limited exposure to successful Indigenous-led urban projects.
   - Solution: Use virtual tours or video case studies of projects from other countries to provide examples.

5. Challenge: Students may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of urban inequities.
   - Solution: Break down the issues into manageable components and emphasize the importance of focused, community-driven solutions.

6. Challenge: Difficulty in simulating real-world community engagement in the classroom.
   - Solution: Organize role-playing exercises and, if possible, arrange for students to participate in actual community meetings or events.
