# 1. Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "The Land of Gold" by Judith Bovensiepen

"The concept of lulik is central to East Timorese cosmology and social organization. Lulik can be translated as 'sacred,' 'forbidden,' or 'taboo,' but these translations fail to capture its full complexity and significance in Timorese life. Lulik is not just a religious concept; it permeates all aspects of social, political, and economic relations.

Lulik is associated with the ancestors, the land, and the spiritual realm. It is a source of power that can be both beneficial and dangerous. Sacred objects, places, and practices are considered lulik, and they are treated with great respect and caution. The uma lulik, or sacred house, is a physical manifestation of lulik, serving as a repository for sacred objects and a site for important rituals.

In everyday life, lulik influences behavior through a complex system of prohibitions and obligations. It shapes agricultural practices, mediates social relationships, and plays a crucial role in conflict resolution. Understanding lulik is essential to comprehending the worldview and cultural practices of the East Timorese people."
