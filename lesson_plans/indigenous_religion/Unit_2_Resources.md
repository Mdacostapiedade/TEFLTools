## Excerpt from Historical Document

From a letter by Fr. António de São Jacinto, O.P., to the King of Portugal (1643):

"The conversion of these gentiles is very difficult, as they are much attached to their ancient customs and superstitions. However, with patience and perseverance, we have made some progress, particularly among the young. We have established a school where we teach the catechism and Portuguese letters, hoping that these young souls will be the future of the Church in this land. The greatest obstacle we face is the resistance of the elders and the lia nain, who see our presence as a threat to their authority and traditions. We must proceed with caution and wisdom, always seeking to show the love of Christ through our actions as well as our words."
