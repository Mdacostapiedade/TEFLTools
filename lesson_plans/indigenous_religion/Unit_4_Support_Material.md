   **Solution**: Establish ground rules for respectful discussion. Emphasize the academic nature of the analysis and encourage students to approach the topic objectively.

3. **Challenge**: Students might struggle to understand the concept of syncretism.
   **Solution**: Use familiar examples from other cultures before introducing East Timorese cases. Provide visual aids to illustrate the concept.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in visualizing syncretic practices without firsthand experience.
   **Solution**: Utilize a variety of visual materials, including photos, videos, and illustrations. If possible, invite a guest speaker with firsthand knowledge.
