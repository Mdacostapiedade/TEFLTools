# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Case Study: The Revival of Uma Lulik in Viqueque

In the district of Viqueque, the Naueti-speaking community has been actively reviving their uma lulik (sacred house) traditions. After years of neglect during the Indonesian occupation, the community came together in 2010 to rebuild their ancestral sacred house. The process involved complex negotiations between different lineages, as well as discussions about how to adapt traditional building methods to modern materials.

The rebuilt uma lulik now serves as a focal point for community gatherings and rituals. However, its use has evolved. While traditional ceremonies are still performed, the space is also used for community meetings about development projects and even as an informal classroom for teaching young people about Naueti culture.

This case demonstrates how sacred traditions are being adapted to serve both spiritual and practical needs in contemporary East Timorese society. It raises questions about the balance between preserving tradition and embracing modernity.
