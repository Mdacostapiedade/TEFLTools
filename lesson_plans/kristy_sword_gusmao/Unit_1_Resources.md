# Resources for Learning Unit 1: Language Policy and Planning in Timor-Leste

## 1. Full Text Excerpts

### Excerpt from Timor-Leste's National Education Strategic Plan 2011-2030

"The Constitution of Timor-Leste establishes Portuguese and Tetum as the official languages of the country. It also recognizes the need to value and develop national languages. The Basic Law of Education establishes that the teaching languages of the Timorese education system are Tetum and Portuguese. The Ministry of Education is committed to promoting these languages as languages of instruction and to developing a multilingual education based on the mother tongues of students to improve access to education, student retention, and learning outcomes."

### Excerpt from "Language Policy in Timor-Leste: A Critical Analysis" by Jo√£o Sarmento

"The language policy of Timor-Leste reflects the complex historical and political context of the nation. The choice of Portuguese as an official language alongside Tetum was a strategic decision aimed at differentiating Timor-Leste from its neighbors and reinforcing its unique identity. However, this policy has faced significant challenges in implementation, particularly in the education sector where many teachers and students lack proficiency in Portuguese."
