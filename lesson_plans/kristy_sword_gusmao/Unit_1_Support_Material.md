## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may have limited background knowledge of Timor-Leste
   Solution: Provide a brief historical and geographical introduction to Timor-Leste at the beginning of the lesson. Use visual aids like maps and timelines to support understanding.

2. Challenge: Complexity of language policy issues
   Solution: Break down complex concepts into smaller, manageable parts. Use real-life examples and case studies to illustrate abstract ideas.

3. Challenge: Engaging students with diverse language backgrounds
   Solution: Encourage students to share their own language experiences and draw parallels with the Timor-Leste situation. Use the warm-up language biography activity to personalize the topic.

4. Challenge: Balancing historical context with current policy analysis
   Solution: Clearly structure the lesson to show the connection between historical events and current policies. Use the timeline activity to help students visualize this connection.

5. Challenge: Encouraging critical thinking about policy implementation
   Solution: Use guided questions in the policy analysis and case study activities to prompt deeper reflection. Encourage debate and discussion of different perspectives on language policy issues.

6. Challenge: Time management with multiple activities
   Solution: Be prepared to adjust activity durations based on student engagement and understanding. Have additional discussion questions or extension activities ready for groups that finish early.

7. Challenge: Addressing potential controversial aspects of language policy
   Solution: Establish ground rules for respectful discussion at the beginning of the class. Encourage students to base their arguments on evidence and to consider multiple viewpoints.
