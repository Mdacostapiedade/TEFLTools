## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited resources in mother tongues
   - Solution: Collaborate with local communities to develop materials; use storytelling and oral traditions

2. Challenge: Resistance from parents who prefer instruction in official languages
   - Solution: Organize community meetings to explain the benefits of MTBMLE; showcase success stories

3. Challenge: Teachers' limited proficiency in students' mother tongues
   - Solution: Pair teachers with community language assistants; provide ongoing language training for teachers

4. Challenge: Balancing multiple languages in the classroom
   - Solution: Use clear language separation strategies; develop a structured language transition plan

5. Challenge: Assessment in multiple languages
   - Solution: Develop bilingual assessments; allow students to demonstrate knowledge in their strongest language

6. Challenge: Lack of standardized orthography for some languages
   - Solution: Work with linguists and community leaders to develop and agree on writing systems

7. Challenge: Integrating MTBMLE with national curriculum requirements
   - Solution: Develop bridging materials that connect mother tongue content with national standards

8. Challenge: Sustaining MTBMLE programs beyond early grades
   - Solution: Advocate for long-term policy support; develop language transition strategies for upper grades
