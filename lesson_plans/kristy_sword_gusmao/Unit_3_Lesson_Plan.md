# Lesson Plan: School Facilities and Student Participation in Timor-Leste

## Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts with school facility assessment checklist
- Flip charts and markers for group work
- Digital cameras or smartphones for field visit documentation
- Guest speaker from local education department (if available)

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify key components of school infrastructure that impact student learning
2. Analyze the relationship between school facilities and student participation rates
3. Evaluate the current state of school facilities in Timor-Leste
4. Develop proposals for improving school facilities to enhance student participation

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

1. Display images of various school facilities (well-equipped vs. poorly-equipped) from around the world.
2. Ask students to discuss in pairs:
   - Which school would you prefer to attend and why?
   - How might these different environments affect student learning and participation?
3. Share responses with the class, noting key themes on the board.

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)

Introduce and define key terms:
- Infrastructure
- Enrollment rates
- Attendance rates
- Learning outcomes
- Student participation
- Sanitation facilities

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Overview of current state of school facilities in Timor-Leste
   - Present statistics on school infrastructure (e.g., % of schools with adequate classrooms, sanitation, electricity)
   - Discuss regional disparities in facility quality

2. Impact of facilities on student participation and learning
   - Present research findings on correlation between facility quality and:
     - Enrollment rates
     - Attendance rates
     - Learning outcomes
   - Discuss gender-specific impacts (e.g., lack of separate toilets for girls)

3. Case studies of successful facility improvement projects in Timor-Leste or similar contexts
   - Highlight key factors contributing to success
   - Discuss challenges faced and how they were overcome

## Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Group Analysis (20 minutes)
   - Divide class into small groups
   - Provide each group with a case study of a school in Timor-Leste
   - Groups analyze the case study, identifying:
     - Current facility challenges
     - Potential impacts on student participation
     - Proposed improvements

2. Role Play (25 minutes)
   - Assign roles: school principal, teacher, parent, student, education official
   - Groups act out a meeting to discuss facility improvements
   - Each person advocates for improvements from their perspective

## Production Task (60 minutes)

Field Visit to Local School:
1. Students visit a nearby school to assess facilities
2. Use provided checklist to evaluate:
   - Classroom conditions
   - Sanitation facilities
   - Learning resources (e.g., textbooks, technology)
   - Playground/recreational areas
3. Interview 2-3 students about their perceptions of school facilities
4. Document observations with photos (if permitted)

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

1. Groups share key findings from field visit
2. Class discussion:
   - What were the most significant facility issues observed?
   - How might these issues impact student participation?
   - What creative solutions could address these challenges?

## Homework Assignment

Develop a proposal for improving school facilities to enhance student participation:
1. Choose one specific school (either from field visit or case study)
2. Outline current facility challenges
3. Propose 3-5 specific improvements
4. Explain how each improvement would enhance student participation
5. Consider cost-effectiveness and feasibility in the Timor-Leste context
