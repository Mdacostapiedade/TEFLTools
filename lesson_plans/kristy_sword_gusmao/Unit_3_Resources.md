- Solar panel installation program reaching 15% of rural schools
- UNICEF partnership providing water and sanitation to 100 schools in 2019-2020

## Impact of Facilities on Student Participation and Learning

### Enrollment Rates
- Schools with improved facilities see an average 15% increase in enrollment
- Gender-specific impacts: Separate toilets for girls can increase female enrollment by up to 11%

### Attendance Rates
- Clean water access correlates with 5-10% higher daily attendance
- Proper sanitation facilities reduce absence due to illness by 20-30%

### Learning Outcomes
- Students in schools with electricity score 12% higher on standardized tests
- Access to libraries and learning materials improves reading scores by 8-15%

### Gender-Specific Impacts
