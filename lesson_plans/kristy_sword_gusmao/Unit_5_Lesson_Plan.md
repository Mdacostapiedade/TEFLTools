# Lesson Plan: Teacher Training and Pedagogy in Multilingual Contexts

## Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts with sample multilingual lesson plans
- Video clips of multilingual classroom teaching
- Flip chart paper and markers for group work

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify key challenges in teacher preparation for multilingual education
2. Analyze effective pedagogical approaches for diverse linguistic backgrounds
3. Evaluate a multilingual classroom teaching session
4. Design components of a teacher training workshop for multilingual education

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Language Biography: Students create a visual representation of their language learning journey, including all languages they've been exposed to and in what contexts. They share these in pairs, discussing how their experiences might influence their teaching approach.

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)

- Translanguaging
- Code-switching
- Metalinguistic awareness
- Scaffolding
- Culturally responsive teaching

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Overview of current teacher training programs in Timor-Leste
2. Challenges in preparing teachers for multilingual classrooms
3. Effective pedagogical approaches for multilingual education:
   - Translanguaging strategies
   - Scaffolding techniques
   - Culturally responsive teaching methods
4. Case studies of successful multilingual education programs

## Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Video Analysis (20 minutes):
   Students watch a video of a multilingual classroom teaching session. In small groups, they analyze the teaching strategies used, identifying strengths and areas for improvement.

2. Pedagogical Approach Carousel (25 minutes):
   Set up stations around the room, each focusing on a different pedagogical approach for multilingual education. Groups rotate through the stations, discussing how to implement each approach and potential challenges.

## Production Task (30 minutes)

Design a Mini Teacher Training Workshop:
In groups of 3-4, students design a 1-hour teacher training workshop component focused on a specific aspect of multilingual education (e.g., translanguaging strategies, culturally responsive teaching). They outline the workshop objectives, activities, and materials needed.

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

1. Each group presents a 1-minute pitch of their teacher training workshop component.
2. Class discussion on key takeaways and how these strategies could be implemented in Timor-Leste's educational context.

## Homework Assignment

1. Observe a local classroom (multilingual if possible) for 30 minutes. Write a 2-page reflection on the teaching strategies used, language dynamics, and suggestions for incorporating multilingual approaches.
2. Read: Benson, C. (2004). The importance of mother tongue-based schooling for educational quality. UNESCO.

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

1. Translanguaging: The process of making meaning, shaping experiences, and gaining understanding and knowledge through the use of two or more languages.

2. Code-switching: The practice of alternating between two or more languages or varieties of language in conversation.

3. Metalinguistic awareness: The ability to reflect on and manipulate the structural features of language independent of meaning.

4. Scaffolding: Temporary support provided to a student by a teacher to help them achieve a task they may not be able to do independently.

5. Culturally responsive teaching: A pedagogy that recognizes the importance of including students' cultural references in all aspects of learning.
