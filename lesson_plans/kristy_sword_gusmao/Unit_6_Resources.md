## Case Study: Language Policy Implementation in a Rural Timorese School

### Background
The village of Suai-Loro, located in the southwestern coast of Timor-Leste, has a population primarily speaking Tetum Terik, a dialect of Tetum.

- Teacher training programs focusing on multilingual pedagogy
- Gradual transition model from mother tongue to official languages

### Results (After 2 Years)
- Improved student attendance and participation
- Higher scores in early grade reading assessments
- Increased parental engagement in school activities

### Discussion Points
1. How does this case study reflect the broader challenges of implementing multilingual education in Timor-Leste?
2. What factors contributed to the initial success of this program?
3. What potential long-term challenges might this school face as students progress to higher grades?
4. How could this model be adapted or improved for implementation in other regions of Timor-Leste?
