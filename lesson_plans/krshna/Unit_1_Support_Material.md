3. **Challenge**: Comparing Krishna stories to Timorese folk tales may be difficult for some students.
   **Solution**: Provide a structured comparison chart and guide students through the process with specific examples. Encourage them to focus on themes, character types, and moral lessons.

4. **Challenge**: Students may have difficulty understanding the concept of avatar.
   **Solution**: Use familiar examples from popular culture (e.g., shapeshifters in movies) as a starting point, then explain how the Hindu concept differs.

5. **Challenge**: The philosophical aspects of Krishna's teachings may be challenging for some students.
   **Solution**: Start with concrete examples and gradually introduce more abstract concepts. Use role-playing activities to help students relate the teachings to their own lives.

6. **Challenge**: Students from different religious backgrounds may feel uncomfortable discussing Hindu concepts.
   **Solution**: Emphasize the academic and cultural aspects of the lesson. Encourage respectful dialogue and comparison with students' own beliefs without pressuring anyone to accept or reject ideas.
