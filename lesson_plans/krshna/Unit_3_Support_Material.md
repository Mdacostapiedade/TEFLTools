## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to understand the concept of detachment.
   **Solution**: Use relatable examples from students' lives. Emphasize that detachment doesn't mean not caring, but rather not being overly attached to specific outcomes.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in connecting karma yoga to Timorese culture.
   **Solution**: Invite students to share examples of selfless service in their communities. Draw parallels between karma yoga and traditional Timorese values of collective responsibility.

3. **Challenge**: Students may view karma yoga as passive or lacking ambition.
   **Solution**: Stress the importance of skill and excellence in karma yoga. Discuss how detachment can actually lead to better performance and results.

4. **Challenge**: Applying karma yoga to real-life situations may seem abstract.
   **Solution**: Use role-playing exercises and real-world scenarios to make the concepts more concrete. Encourage students to start with small, everyday actions.

5. **Challenge**: Some students may resist the spiritual aspects of karma yoga.
   **Solution**: Present karma yoga as a practical philosophy for well-being and effective action, not necessarily tied to religious beliefs. Focus on its benefits for mental health and social harmony.
