## Lalleshwari's Verses (Translated)

1. "I, Lalla, entered the gate of the mind's garden
   There, Shiva and Shakti were sitting together
   I was absorbed into them, and my mind became pure
   O, how joyous I became!"

2. "The soul, like the moon,
   is new, and always new again.
   And I have seen the ocean
   continuously creating.
   Nothing is absolute.
   Thus I have seen the truth."

3. "The path to self-realization is arduous
   Difficult to tread as the edge of a sword
   But once you realize the truth within
   You'll see it's easier than stepping over a flower"

4. "Shiva is all-pervading
   Yet hidden from sight
   If you look within and seek Him
   All doubt will take flight"

5. "Temple or no temple, it's all the same
   Rituals or no rituals, God is to blame
   Shiva is everywhere, don't you see?
   In you, in me, in all that came to be"
