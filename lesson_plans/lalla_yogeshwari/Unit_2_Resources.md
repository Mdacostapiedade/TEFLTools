## 1. Full Text of Excerpts

### Lalleshwari's Verses (Translated)

1. "I, Lalla, entered the gate of the mind's garden
   And saw Shiva united with Shakti.
   I was immersed in the lake of undying bliss.
   Here, in this lifetime, I've been unchained from the wheel of birth and death."

2. "The soul, like the moon, is new, and always new again.
   And I have seen the ocean continuously creating.
   Nothing is real but the Beloved.
   Nothing matters but love for the Beloved."

3. "The way is not far, nor is it near.
   It is within you, if you can find it.
   Seek it not outside yourself,
   For it dwells in the cave of your heart."

4. "Shiva abides in all things,
   In all things abides Shiva.
   Apart from Shiva I know no one;
   Whom shall I worship, then, and whom propitiate?"

5. "The self-same lesson I gave myself day and night:
   Shed off your ego as a snake its slough.
   Make your body a holy shrine,
   Let your mind be a hermit dwelling therein."
