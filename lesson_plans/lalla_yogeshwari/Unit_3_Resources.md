## Lalleshwari's Verses on Religious Harmony

1. "Shiva abides in all that is, everywhere;
   Then do not discriminate between a Hindu and a Muslim.
   If thou art wise, know thyself!
   That is true knowledge of the Lord."

2. "The same Lord resides in all,
   Why do you discriminate?
   The wise see Him in all,
   The ignorant divide and fall."

3. "Temple and mosque are made of the same clay,
   Different are the bells that ring to pray.
   When the lamps are lit, the light is one,
   Why then do we quarrel and run?"

4. "Some worship stones, some mutter charms,
   Some see God here, some there.
   But I see Him laughing in everything,
   Tell me, who can be so wise?"

5. "Shiva is all-pervading,
   Do not differentiate between Hindus and Muslims.
   If you are clever, recognize your own Self.
   That is the true way to realize God."
