## Lalleshwari's Verses on Social Critique

### Verse 1: On Caste System
```
High-born Brahmin, low-born Shudra,
All are equal in the eyes of Shiva.
Recognize the essence within,
For caste is but an outer skin.
```

### Verse 2: On Gender Discrimination
```
Woman or man, what matters the form?
The soul inside knows no such norm.
In devotion and spiritual quest,
Both can attain the highest crest.
```

### Verse 3: On Religious Orthodoxy
```
Temples of stone cannot contain Him,
Nor can mosques of brick confine Him.
He dwells in the heart, pure and free,
Rituals alone won't let you see.
```

### Verse 4: On Empty Rituals
```
Fasting and feasting, both are vain,
If inner purity you don't gain.
Cleanse your mind of ego's stain,
Then every breath becomes divine refrain.
```
