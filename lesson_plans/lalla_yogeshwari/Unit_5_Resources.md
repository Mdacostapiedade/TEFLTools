## Lalleshwari's Verses on Mystical Experiences

1. "I, Lalla, entered the gate of the mind's garden
   And saw Shiva united with Shakti.
   I was immersed in the lake of undying bliss.
   Here, in this lifetime, I've been unchained from the wheel of birth and death."

2. "The soul, like the moon,
   Is new, and always new again.
   And I have seen the ocean
   Continuously creating.
   Nothing is real but the Beloved.
   Nothing matters but love for the Beloved."

3. "Your way of knowing is a private herb garden.
   Mine is an infinite meadow.
   You have your small containers of theory.
   I have the shoreless ocean of realization."

4. "I wearied myself searching for the Friend,
   With no success.
   Then I looked within and found
   The Beloved there, where It always was."

5. "The moment I realized the depth of the Divine,
   I began to dance in ecstasy.
   O mind, why do you worry?
   The Divine is nearer than your breath."

## Guided Meditation Script: Inspired by Lalleshwari's Teachings

(To be read slowly and calmly, with pauses between sections)

Find a comfortable seated position, with your spine straight but not rigid. Gently close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, allowing your body to relax with each exhale.

Bring your attention to your breath, observing its natural rhythm without trying to change it. As you breathe, imagine that with each inhale, you're drawing in divine light and energy, just as Lalleshwari described.

Now, bring your awareness to your heart center. Imagine a soft, warm light glowing in the center of your chest. This light represents your true self, your inner divinity that Lalleshwari spoke of.

As you continue to breathe, allow this light to expand, gradually filling your entire body. Feel it dissolving any tension or resistance it encounters.

Now, imagine this light extending beyond your body, blurring the boundaries between you and your surroundings. Just as Lalleshwari realized the unity of all things, allow yourself to experience a sense of connection with everything around you.

In this expanded state of awareness, silently repeat to yourself: "I am one with the divine. The divine is within me and all around me."

Rest in this awareness for a few moments, allowing any thoughts or sensations to come and go without attachment.

When you're ready, slowly bring your attention back to your body and your surroundings. Take a deep breath and gently open your eyes, carrying the sense of peace and unity with you as you return to your day.
