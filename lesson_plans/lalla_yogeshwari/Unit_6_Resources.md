# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Lalleshwari's Verses

1. "The soul, like the moon,
   is new, and always new again.
   And I have seen the ocean
   continuously creating.
   Nothing is absolute.
   Everything changes, everything moves,
   everything revolves, everything flies and goes away."

2. "I, Lalla, entered the gate of the mind's garden
   and saw Shiva united with Shakti.
   I was immersed in the lake of undying bliss.
   Here, in this lifetime, I've been unchained from the wheel of birth and death."

3. "The way is not far, nor is it near.
   It is within you, if you can find it.
   The path is not hidden, nor is it revealed.
   It is always there, if you can see it."
