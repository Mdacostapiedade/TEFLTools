# Lesson Plan: Constructing Arguments in Lincoln-Douglas Debate

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with sample arguments and worksheets
- Timer for timed activities
- Projector (optional) for displaying examples

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify the three components of an argument: claim, warrant, and impact
- Distinguish between different types of evidence used in debate
- Construct logical arguments using the claim-warrant-impact model

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

**Controversial Statement Game**
- Write a controversial statement on the board (e.g., "Social media should be banned for anyone under 18")
- Have students quickly write down their initial reaction (agree/disagree) and one reason why
- Ask a few students to share their responses, highlighting the natural use of claims and reasons

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)

Introduce and define key terms:
- Claim
- Warrant
- Impact
- Evidence (empirical, anecdotal, expert testimony)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)

### The Claim-Warrant-Impact Model

1. **Claim**: The main argument or position being asserted
   - Example: "Timor-Leste should invest more in renewable energy"

2. **Warrant**: The reasoning or evidence that supports the claim
   - Example: "Renewable energy reduces dependence on fossil fuels and lowers carbon emissions"

3. **Impact**: The significance or consequences of the argument
   - Example: "This will improve Timor-Leste's energy security and contribute to fighting climate change"

### Types of Evidence in Debate

1. Empirical evidence: Statistical data, scientific studies
2. Anecdotal evidence: Personal stories or examples
3. Expert testimony: Opinions or statements from recognized authorities

Provide examples of each type of evidence related to Timorese issues.

## 6. Practice Activities (25 minutes)

### Activity 1: Identifying Argument Components (10 minutes)
- Distribute worksheets with sample arguments related to Timorese issues
- Students identify the claim, warrant, and impact in each argument
- Review answers as a class

### Activity 2: Evidence Sorting (15 minutes)
- In small groups, give students a set of evidence cards on a Timorese topic (e.g., education reform)
- Groups sort the evidence into empirical, anecdotal, and expert testimony categories
- Discuss which types of evidence might be most persuasive and why

## 7. Production Task (20 minutes)

**Creating Arguments on Local Issues**
- Divide class into small groups
- Assign each group a current Timorese issue (e.g., youth unemployment, environmental conservation)
- Groups create two arguments using the claim-warrant-impact model, incorporating at least two types of evidence
- Groups present their arguments to the class for feedback

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the key components of an argument
- Discuss common mistakes to avoid when constructing arguments
- Quick verbal quiz on identifying claims, warrants, and impacts

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Find a newspaper article on a current Timorese issue
2. Identify three arguments made in the article, breaking them down into claim, warrant, and impact
3. Write one original argument on the same issue using the claim-warrant-impact model

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- **Claim**: The main argument or position being asserted in a debate
- **Warrant**: The reasoning, evidence, or justification that supports the claim
- **Impact**: The significance, consequences, or importance of the argument if it is accepted
- **Empirical Evidence**: Verifiable data or information based on observation or experience
- **Anecdotal Evidence**: Evidence based on personal accounts or specific examples
- **Expert Testimony**: Evidence provided by a recognized authority on a subject
