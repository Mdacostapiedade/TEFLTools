## Components of an Argument: Claim, Warrant, Impact

### Claim
- Definition: The main argument or position being asserted in a debate
- Characteristics:
  * Clear and concise statement
  * Debatable (not a fact)
  * Addresses the resolution or topic at hand
- Examples in Timorese context:
  1. "Timor-Leste should prioritize economic diversification over oil and gas development."
  2. "Mandatory national service would benefit Timorese youth and society."

### Warrant
- Definition: The reasoning, evidence, or justification that supports the claim
- Types of warrants:
  1. Logical reasoning
  2. Empirical evidence
  3. Expert opinion
  4. Moral or ethical principles
- Examples:
  1. "Economic diversification reduces vulnerability to market fluctuations and creates more sustainable job opportunities."
  2. "National service programs have been shown to increase civic engagement and provide valuable skills training in other countries."

### Impact
- Definition: The significance, consequences, or importance of the argument if it is accepted
- Key aspects:
  * Explains why the argument matters
  * Links to broader values or goals
  * Can be short-term or long-term
- Examples:
  1. "By diversifying the economy, Timor-Leste can ensure long-term economic stability and reduce poverty rates."
  2. "Implementing national service would strengthen national unity and improve the employability of Timorese youth."

## Types of Evidence and Their Use in Debate

### Empirical Evidence
- Definition: Verifiable data or information based on observation or experience
- Sources:
  * Scientific studies
  * Government statistics
  * Economic data
- Example: "According to the World Bank, Timor-Leste's GDP growth rate was 3.1% in 2019, down from 3.4% in 2018."
- Use in debate: Provides factual support for claims, adds credibility

### Anecdotal Evidence
- Definition: Evidence based on personal accounts or specific examples
- Sources:
  * Personal experiences
  * Case studies
  * News reports of individual events
- Example: "Maria, a farmer from Baucau, increased her crop yield by 30% after implementing sustainable farming techniques."
- Use in debate: Illustrates real-world impacts, makes arguments relatable

### Expert Testimony
- Definition: Evidence provided by a recognized authority on a subject
- Sources:
  * Academic experts
  * Government officials
  * Industry leaders
- Example: "Dr. Jos√© Ramos-Horta, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former President, argues that regional cooperation is crucial for Timor-Leste's development."
- Use in debate: Adds credibility, provides informed perspectives

### Effective Use of Evidence in Debate
1. Relevance: Ensure evidence directly supports the claim
2. Credibility: Use reliable sources and recent data
3. Context: Explain the significance of the evidence
4. Balance: Combine different types of evidence for a stronger argument

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the claim-warrant-impact model help in structuring a persuasive argument?
2. What are some potential challenges in finding reliable evidence for debates on Timorese issues?
3. How might cultural values in Timor-Leste influence the types of warrants that are most persuasive?
4. In what ways can anecdotal evidence be powerful in a debate, and what are its limitations?
5. How can debaters effectively use expert testimony without relying too heavily on appeals to authority?
6. What strategies can be used to connect local Timorese issues to broader global concerns when constructing arguments?
7. How might the use of evidence in debate differ between urban and rural contexts in Timor-Leste?
8. What role does emotional appeal play in constructing arguments, and how can it be balanced with logical reasoning?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Exercise: Constructing Arguments on Timorese Issues

1. Choose one of the following topics:
   a) Education reform in Timor-Leste
   b) Environmental conservation in Timor-Leste
   c) Economic development strategies for Timor-Leste

2. For your chosen topic, construct two complete arguments using the claim-warrant-impact model. Each argument should include:
   - A clear claim
   - At least two warrants supporting the claim
   - An explanation of the impact

3. For each argument, incorporate at least two different types of evidence (empirical, anecdotal, or expert testimony).

4. Write a brief paragraph explaining why you chose the specific evidence and how it strengthens your argument.

5. Be prepared to present one of your arguments to the class and respond to questions or counterarguments from your peers.

# Assignment Details

## Homework: Analyzing and Constructing Arguments from Current Events

1. Find a newspaper article or news report (print or online) about a current issue in Timor-Leste. The article should be from a reputable source and published within the last month.

2. Read the article carefully and identify three distinct arguments made by the author or quoted sources. For each argument:
   a) Identify the claim
   b) Identify the warrant(s)
   c) Identify the impact (explicit or implied)

3. Write a brief analysis (100-150 words) of how effectively each argument is constructed, considering the strength of the warrants and the clarity of the impact.

4. Choose one of the issues discussed in the article and construct your own original argument using the claim-warrant-impact model. Your argument should:
   - Clearly state a claim related to the issue
   - Provide at least two warrants supporting your claim
   - Explain the impact of your argument
   - Incorporate at least two types of evidence (empirical, anecdotal, or expert testimony)

5. Write a reflection (150-200 words) on the process of constructing your argument. Consider the following questions:
   - What challenges did you face in finding evidence to support your claim?
   - How did you decide which types of evidence to use?
   - How might your argument be received by different audiences in Timor-Leste?

6. Prepare to present your original argument in the next class and be ready to defend it against potential counterarguments.

# Additional Materials and Examples

## Sample Argument Analysis

**Topic: Implementing a plastic bag ban in Timor-Leste**

Claim: Timor-Leste should implement a nationwide ban on single-use plastic bags.

Warrants:
1. Environmental Impact: Plastic bags contribute significantly to pollution in Timor-Leste's coastal areas and waterways.
   Evidence (Empirical): A 2020 study by the Ministry of Environment found that plastic bags make up 30% of marine debris along Timor-Leste's coastline.

2. Economic Benefit: A plastic bag ban would stimulate local industries producing eco-friendly alternatives.
   Evidence (Anecdotal): In Dili, several small businesses have already begun producing reusable bags made from local materials, creating new job opportunities.

3. Public Health: Reducing plastic waste would improve sanitation and reduce breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects.
   Evidence (Expert Testimony): Dr. Ana Silva, a public health expert at the National University of Timor-Leste, states that reducing plastic waste is crucial for improving public health outcomes in urban areas.

Impact: Implementing a plastic bag ban would protect Timor-Leste's natural environment, support sustainable economic development, and improve public health, contributing to a cleaner, healthier, and more prosperous future for the nation.
