### Claim-Warrant-Impact Model Diagram

```
[Claim]
   |

[Warrant]
   |
   v
[Impact]
```

Description: A simple flowchart showing the relationship between claim, warrant, and impact. The claim is at the top, connected by an arrow to the warrant below it, which is in turn connected to the impact at the bottom.

### Types of Evidence Pyramid

```
    /\
   /  \
  /    \
 / Emp. \
/--------\
/ Anec.   \
/----------\
/ Expert T. \
------------
```

Description: A pyramid diagram with three levels. The base level is labeled "Expert Testimony," the middle level "Anecdotal," and the top level "Empirical." This visual represents the hierarchy of evidence strength, with empirical evidence typically being the strongest.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to differentiate between claims and warrants.
   **Solution**: Provide more examples and use the visual diagram. Practice identifying claims and warrants in everyday conversations or news articles.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in finding relevant Timorese examples for arguments.
   **Solution**: Create a class resource bank of current events and issues. Invite guest speakers from local organizations to discuss pressing topics.

3. **Challenge**: Students hesitant to engage in controversial topics.
   **Solution**: Establish clear ground rules for respectful discussion. Start with less contentious issues and gradually introduce more complex topics.

4. **Challenge**: Varying levels of English proficiency among students.
   **Solution**: Provide key terms in both English and Tetum. Allow students to practice in Tetum before transitioning to English.

5. **Challenge**: Limited access to up-to-date information or research.
   **Solution**: Compile a resource folder with relevant articles and reports. Teach students how to effectively use available online resources and fact-check information.

6. **Challenge**: Students struggling with time management during speeches.
   **Solution**: Incorporate regular timed speaking exercises. Teach strategies for prioritizing key points and summarizing effectively.
