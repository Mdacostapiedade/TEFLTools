# Lecture Notes

## Defining Value Premises

- A value premise is the core ethical or moral concept that a debater argues should be prioritized in evaluating the resolution
- Value premises are abstract ideals that societies strive to uphold (e.g., justice, liberty, equality, human dignity)
- In LD debate, value premises provide the ethical framework for the entire debate
- Examples of common value premises:
  * Justice
  * Liberty
  * Equality
  * Human dignity
  * Democracy
  * Social welfare
  * Individual rights
- Value premises should be:
  * Relevant to the resolution
  * Universally accepted as positive
  * Broad enough to encompass multiple perspectives

## Selecting and Defending Criteria

- A criterion is a standard or test used to measure how well a side upholds the value premise in the debate
- Criteria provide a concrete way to evaluate abstract values
- Criteria should:
  * Directly relate to the value premise
  * Be measurable or observable
  * Be achievable within the context of the resolution
- Examples of criteria:
  * For Justice: Fairness, Equal treatment under the law
  * For Liberty: Protection of individual rights, Minimization of government intervention
  * For Equality: Equal opportunity, Equal access to resources
- Defending criteria:
  * Explain how the criterion measures the value premise
  * Demonstrate why this measurement is the most appropriate for the resolution
  * Show how the criterion can be applied to both sides of the debate

## Connecting Values to Timorese Cultural Context

- Consider traditional Timorese values:
  * Community solidarity (Umane-Fetosan relationships)
  * Respect for elders and ancestors
  * Connection to land and nature
  * Oral traditions and storytelling
- Examine how these values intersect with modern democratic ideals
- Explore the influence of Catholicism on Timorese value systems
- Discuss the impact of Timor-Leste's history of colonialism and struggle for independence on national values
- Consider how traditional and modern values can be balanced in contemporary Timorese society

# Discussion Questions

1. How do value premises differ from specific policy goals? Why is this distinction important in LD debate?
2. Can you think of a situation where two different value premises might conflict with each other? How would you resolve this conflict in a debate context?
3. What are some challenges in selecting criteria that effectively measure abstract value premises?
4. How might the cultural context of Timor-Leste influence the selection of value premises and criteria in a debate?
5. Can you identify any traditional Timorese values that might be particularly relevant to contemporary political or social issues?
6. How can debaters effectively balance universal ethical principles with culturally specific values when constructing their cases?
7. What role do value premises and criteria play in making debates more than just a comparison of practical outcomes?
8. How might the process of selecting and defending value premises and criteria in debate contribute to a deeper understanding of ethical reasoning in real-world decision-making?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Value Analysis Essay

Write a 500-word essay analyzing a value premise and criterion pair for the following resolution:

"Resolved: The Timorese government should prioritize economic development over environmental protection."

Instructions:
1. Choose a value premise that you believe is most relevant to this resolution.
2. Select an appropriate criterion that effectively measures your chosen value premise.
3. In your essay, address the following points:
   - Explain your chosen value premise and why it is relevant to the resolution.
   - Describe your selected criterion and how it measures the value premise.
   - Discuss how this value-criterion pair could be applied to both the affirmative and negative sides of the resolution.
   - Consider how this value-criterion pair relates to the Timorese cultural context.
4. Conclude by reflecting on how this value-criterion pair might influence the overall debate on this resolution.

# Assignment Details

## Timorese Value Research Project

1. Choose a traditional Timorese value or cultural practice not discussed in class.
2. Research this value or practice, using at least three sources (which may include interviews with community members or elders).
3. Prepare a 5-minute presentation for the class that includes:
   - An explanation of the value or practice
   - Its historical and cultural significance in Timor-Leste
   - How this value might be applied in a modern debate context
   - Two potential criteria that could be used to measure this value in a debate
   - An example of a current issue in Timor-Leste where this value might be relevant
4. Create a one-page handout summarizing your research to distribute to your classmates.

# Additional Materials and Examples

## Sample Value-Criterion Pairs for Timorese Context

1. Value: Cultural Preservation

2. Value: National Unity
   Criterion: Equitable Resource Distribution Among Regions

3. Value: Sustainable Development
   Criterion: Balance of Economic Growth and Environmental Protection

## Case Study: Applying Values to a Timorese Debate Topic

Resolution: "The Timorese government should implement a national language policy that prioritizes Tetum over Portuguese."

Affirmative Approach:
- Value Premise: Cultural Identity
- Criterion: Preservation and Promotion of Indigenous Language

Negative Approach:
- Value Premise: Global Engagement
- Criterion: Economic and Diplomatic Opportunities

Discuss how these value-criterion pairs might shape the debate and reflect different priorities within Timorese society.
