# 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

# 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggle to differentiate between values and criteria
   - Solution: Provide clear examples and use the visual aid to illustrate the relationship. Practice identifying values and criteria in various contexts.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in connecting values to Timorese cultural context
   - Solution: Invite guest speakers from the community to discuss local values. Encourage students to interview family members about important cultural values.

3. Challenge: Students choose overly broad or vague criteria
   - Solution: Teach the SMART criteria framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) and practice refining broad criteria into more specific ones.

4. Challenge: Lack of engagement in the Values Auction warm-up activity
   - Solution: Use local currency instead of dollars and include values specifically relevant to Timorese youth to increase interest and participation.

5. Challenge: Students struggle to justify their value-criterion choices
   - Solution: Provide a structured framework for justification (e.g., cultural significance, historical importance, current relevance) and model the process with examples.

6. Challenge: Difficulty in applying value-criterion pairs to current issues
   - Solution: Create a regularly updated list of current Timorese issues and practice applying different value-criterion pairs to these topics in class discussions.
