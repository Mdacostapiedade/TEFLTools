## Components of Affirmative and Negative Cases

### Affirmative Case Structure

1. Introduction
   - Capture audience attention
   - Provide context for the resolution

2. Resolution Statement
   - Clearly state the resolution being debated

3. Definitions
   - Define key terms in the resolution
   - Establish the framework for the debate

4. Value Premise and Criterion
   - Identify the core value being upheld
   - Establish a criterion to measure achievement of the value

5. Contentions (usually 2-3)
   - Main arguments supporting the resolution
   - Each contention should:
     * Have a clear claim
     * Provide warrants (reasoning)
     * Explain the impact
     * Link back to the value premise and criterion

6. Conclusion
   - Summarize main points
   - Reaffirm the resolution

### Negative Case Structure

1. Introduction
   - Briefly acknowledge the resolution
   - Indicate opposition

2. Value Premise and Criterion
   - May accept affirmative's value or propose an alternative
   - Establish a criterion that better upholds the value

3. Contentions (usually 1-2)
   - Arguments against the resolution or affirmative case
   - Structure similar to affirmative contentions

4. Responses to Affirmative Case
   - Direct refutation of affirmative arguments
   - Demonstrate how negative position better achieves the value

## Strategies for Case Organization

1. Logical Flow of Arguments
   - Arrange contentions in a logical sequence
   - Build upon previous points

2. Connecting Contentions to Value Premise and Criterion
   - Explicitly link each argument back to the core value
   - Show how contentions fulfill the criterion

3. Using Signposting and Transitions
   - Use clear language to indicate movement between points
   - Employ transitions to create a cohesive narrative

4. Anticipating and Addressing Counterarguments
   - Acknowledge potential opposing views
   - Preemptively refute key counterarguments

5. Balancing Breadth and Depth
   - Cover sufficient ground to support the resolution
   - Provide enough depth to make arguments compelling

6. Using Evidence Effectively
   - Integrate relevant facts, statistics, and expert opinions
   - Explain the significance of evidence in context of the argument

7. Crafting a Memorable Introduction and Conclusion
   - Open with a hook to engage the audience
   - Close with a powerful statement reinforcing the main thesis

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the structure of an affirmative case differ from a negative case, and why are these differences important?

2. What role do value premises and criteria play in Lincoln-Douglas debate? How can they be effectively used to strengthen a case?

3. How can a debater ensure that their contentions are cohesively linked to their value premise and criterion?

4. What strategies can be employed to make a case more persuasive and memorable to judges and audiences?

5. How might case construction in Lincoln-Douglas debate be adapted to address uniquely Timorese social issues?

6. What are some potential challenges in constructing a case on a complex social issue, and how can these challenges be overcome?

7. How can a debater effectively anticipate and address potential counterarguments within their case structure?

8. In what ways can the organization of a case impact its overall effectiveness in a debate?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Affirmative Case Outline Development

1. Choose a current social issue relevant to Timor-Leste from the list generated in the warm-up activity.

2. Develop an outline for an affirmative case on your chosen issue, including the following components:
   - Introduction
   - Resolution statement
   - Definitions of key terms
   - Value premise and criterion
   - 2-3 contentions (with claims, warrants, and impacts)
   - Conclusion

3. For each contention, ensure that you:
   - Clearly state the main claim
   - Provide logical reasoning (warrants) to support the claim
   - Explain the impact of the argument
   - Link the contention back to your value premise and criterion

4. Use signposting and transitions to create a logical flow between sections of your case.

5. In your conclusion, summarize your main points and reaffirm the resolution.

6. Be prepared to share your outline with a peer for review and feedback.

# Assignment Details

## Homework: Completing and Enhancing the Affirmative Case Outline

1. Finish the affirmative case outline started in class, ensuring all components are present and fully developed.

2. Research and add at least two pieces of evidence to support your contentions. This evidence can include:
   - Statistics from reputable sources
   - Expert opinions
   - Historical examples
   - Relevant case studies

3. For each piece of evidence, write a brief explanation of how it strengthens your argument and relates to your value premise and criterion.

4. Review your case for logical flow and coherence. Make any necessary adjustments to improve the overall structure and persuasiveness of your arguments.

5. Prepare a 2-minute summary of your case to present in the next class. This summary should:
   - Clearly state the resolution
   - Briefly explain your value premise and criterion
   - Highlight your main contentions
   - Conclude with a strong reaffirmation of your position

6. Be ready to answer questions about your case and receive constructive feedback from your peers and instructor.
