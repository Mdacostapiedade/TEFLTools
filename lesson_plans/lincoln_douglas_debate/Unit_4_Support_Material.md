## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with English debate terminology
   - **Solution**: Provide a bilingual glossary (English-Tetum) of debate terms and encourage use of simpler language when explaining concepts

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in finding relevant Timorese social issues for debate topics
   - **Solution**: Collaborate with local NGOs or government offices to identify current issues; encourage students to bring in news articles about local concerns

3. **Challenge**: Students hesitant to express opinions on controversial topics
   - **Solution**: Create a safe classroom environment by establishing ground rules for respectful discussion; emphasize that debate is about exploring ideas, not personal attacks

4. **Challenge**: Uneven participation in group activities
   - **Solution**: Assign roles within groups (e.g., researcher, writer, presenter) to ensure all students are actively involved

5. **Challenge**: Time management during practice activities
   - **Solution**: Use a visible timer and give clear time warnings; practice time management skills as part of the lesson

6. **Challenge**: Students struggling to connect values to Timorese context
   - **Solution**: Provide examples of how traditional Timorese values relate to modern social issues; invite a local elder or community leader to discuss values

7. **Challenge**: Difficulty in organizing arguments coherently
   - **Solution**: Use visual aids like flow charts or mind maps to help students see the logical connections between ideas

8. **Challenge**: Limited access to research materials
   - **Solution**: Create a classroom resource center with relevant articles, reports, and books; teach effective internet research skills using available resources
