# Lesson Plan: Refutation and Rebuttal

## Resources Needed
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with sample arguments
- Timer
- Debate resolution cards

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify and explain different types of refutation
2. Apply refutation techniques to opponent arguments
3. Construct effective rebuttals in a debate context

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
### Argument Reversal
1. Divide students into pairs
2. Provide each pair with a simple claim (e.g., "Coffee is the best drink")
3. One student argues for the claim, the other against it
4. After 2 minutes, have students switch sides
5. Discuss how it felt to argue both sides of an issue

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)
Write the following terms on the board and briefly explain each:
- Refutation
- Turn
- Take-out
- Mitigate
- Rebuttal

## Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)
### Types of Refutation
1. Turn: Explain how a turn shows that an opponent's argument actually supports your side
2. Take-out: Describe how a take-out directly challenges the validity of an argument
3. Mitigate: Discuss how mitigation reduces the impact of an opponent's argument

### Principles of Effective Rebuttal
1. Address key arguments
2. Use evidence and logic
3. Maintain organization
4. Connect to your overall case

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)
### Refutation Drill
1. Divide class into small groups
2. Provide each group with a list of common arguments on Timorese topics
3. Have students practice identifying and applying different refutation types to each argument
4. Groups share their best refutations with the class

### Mini-Debate Rebuttals
1. Pair students and assign a simple resolution
2. One student gives a brief constructive speech (2 minutes)
3. The other student practices giving a rebuttal (2 minutes)
4. Switch roles and repeat with a new resolution

## Production Task (20 minutes)
### Rebuttal Speech Construction
1. Provide students with a sample affirmative case on a Timorese issue
2. Students individually prepare a 3-minute negative rebuttal speech
3. Volunteers present their rebuttals to the class
4. Class provides constructive feedback

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
1. Recap the types of refutation and key principles of rebuttal
2. Ask students to share one new strategy they learned
3. Address any remaining questions

## Homework Assignment
1. Write a 1-page rebuttal to the following argument: "Timor-Leste should prioritize economic development over environmental protection."
2. Include at least one example each of a turn, take-out, and mitigation in your rebuttal.
