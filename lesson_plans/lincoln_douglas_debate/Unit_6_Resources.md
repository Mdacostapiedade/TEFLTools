## Purpose and Strategy of Cross-Examination

### Definition and Objectives
- Cross-examination is a 3-minute period in Lincoln-Douglas debate where one debater questions the opponent
- Primary objectives:
  1. Clarify opponent's arguments
  2. Expose weaknesses in opponent's case
  3. Set up your own arguments for later speeches

### Strategic Considerations
- Use cross-examination to:
  - Fill gaps in your flowing (note-taking)
  - Challenge unclear definitions or interpretations
  - Highlight contradictions in opponent's case
  - Secure concessions that support your arguments
- Be mindful of time management
- Maintain a respectful and professional demeanor

## Techniques for Asking Questions

### Types of Questions
1. Open-ended questions
   - Allow for expansive answers
   - Useful for gathering information
   - Example: "How do you define 'economic development' in the context of your argument?"

2. Closed questions
   - Require specific, often yes/no answers
   - Useful for pinning down precise points
   - Example: "Does your plan include increased foreign investment?"

3. Clarification questions
   - Used to ensure understanding of opponent's arguments
   - Example: "When you say 'long-term benefits,' what timeframe are you considering?"

4. Leading questions
   - Guide the respondent towards a particular answer
   - Use cautiously, as they can be seen as manipulative
   - Example: "Wouldn't you agree that environmental protection is crucial for sustainable development?"

### Questioning Strategies
- Start with broader questions, then narrow focus
- Use follow-up questions to probe deeper into responses
- Phrase questions clearly and concisely
- Avoid compound questions (asking multiple things at once)
- Be prepared to rephrase if the opponent doesn't understand

## Techniques for Answering Questions

### General Principles
- Listen carefully to the entire question before responding
- Answer directly and concisely
- Maintain composure under pressure
- Be honest - admit what you must, but explain your position
- Use answers to reinforce your case when possible

### Specific Strategies
1. Clarification
   - If a question is unclear, ask for clarification
   - Example: "Could you please rephrase the question? I want to make sure I understand what you're asking."

2. Bridging
   - Connect your answer to key points in your case
   - Example: "While I agree that economic growth is important, it's crucial to consider the environmental impacts, which ties into my value of sustainability..."

3. Redirection
   - Steer the conversation towards your strengths when appropriate
   - Example: "That's an interesting point, but I think the more important issue here is..."

4. Handling difficult questions
   - If you don't know an answer, admit it but explain why it doesn't undermine your overall argument
   - For loaded questions, address the underlying assumption before answering

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Becoming defensive or argumentative
- Providing long, rambling answers
- Introducing new arguments (save these for speeches)
- Allowing opponent to cut off your answers prematurely

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Exercise: Crafting Effective Cross-Examination Questions

1. Choose one of the following resolutions:
   a. "Timor-Leste should prioritize infrastructure development over education funding."
   b. "The Timorese government should implement stricter regulations on foreign investment."

2. For your chosen resolution, write:
   - 3 open-ended questions
   - 3 closed questions
   - 2 clarification questions
   - 2 follow-up questions (assuming hypothetical initial answers)

3. For each question, briefly explain:
   - The purpose of the question
   - What information you hope to gain or what point you're trying to establish
   - How you might use the answer in your argumentation

4. Review your questions and consider:
   - Are they clear and concise?
   - Do they avoid being argumentative or hostile?
   - How might an opponent try to evade or redirect these questions?

5. Write a short paragraph reflecting on the challenges you faced in crafting these questions and what you learned about effective cross-examination techniques.

# Assignment Details

## Cross-Examination Analysis and Preparation

### Part 1: Video Analysis
1. Watch two online debate videos featuring cross-examination segments. Choose debates on topics relevant to Timor-Leste if possible.
2. For each video, write a 300-word analysis addressing:
   - The most effective questions asked and why they were effective
   - How well debaters responded to tough questions
   - What could have been improved in the cross-examination
   - Any cultural differences you notice compared to Timorese communication styles

### Part 2: Question Preparation
1. For the resolution "Timor-Leste should implement compulsory voting in national elections":
   - Prepare a list of 5 potential cross-examination questions for the affirmative side
   - Prepare a list of 5 potential cross-examination questions for the negative side
2. For each question, provide a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of your strategic intent

### Part 3: Reflection
Write a 200-word reflection on how you might apply cross-examination skills to real-life situations in Timor-Leste, such as community discussions or conflict resolution.

## Sample Cross-Examination Exchange

Resolution: "Timor-Leste should significantly increase its investment in renewable energy."

Affirmative Constructive (excerpt):
"...Therefore, by investing in renewable energy, Timor-Leste can reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, create new jobs in the green sector, and position itself as a leader in sustainable development in Southeast Asia."

Negative Cross-Examination:

N: Thank you for your speech. You mentioned job creation in the renewable energy sector. Do you have any specific estimates for the number of jobs that would be created?

A: While I don't have exact figures, studies in similar developing countries have shown significant job growth in this sector.

N: Can you name any of these similar countries?

A: Countries like Indonesia and the Philippines have seen job growth in renewable energy.

N: Are you aware of the current unemployment rate in Timor-Leste?

A: I don't have the exact figure, but I know it's a significant issue.

N: It's around 4.5% as of 2020. Given this relatively low rate, do you still see job creation as a primary benefit of renewable energy investment?

A: Yes, because it's not just about reducing unemployment, but also about creating higher-quality, sustainable jobs for the future.

N: You also mentioned reducing dependence on fossil fuels. What percentage of Timor-Leste's current energy comes from fossil fuels?

A: A significant portion, though I don't have the exact percentage.

N: And what's the estimated cost of this proposed investment in renewable energy?

A: The cost would depend on the scale of implementation, but it would be a substantial investment.

N: Given Timor-Leste's limited budget, wouldn't this investment take away from other critical areas like education or healthcare?

A: While there would be initial costs, the long-term benefits of renewable energy would ultimately support development in all sectors.

N: Thank you, no further questions.

## Key Takeaways from Sample Exchange

1. The negative debater uses a mix of closed and open-ended questions to gather information and challenge the affirmative case.
2. Questions progress from specific (job numbers) to broader implications (budget priorities).
3. The affirmative debater handles lack of specific knowledge by admitting what they don't know but maintaining their overall argument.
4. The negative debater introduces facts (unemployment rate) to challenge the affirmative's claims.
5. The exchange highlights the importance of being prepared with specific data and examples to support arguments.
