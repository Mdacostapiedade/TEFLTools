## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students asking argumentative or hostile questions
   - **Solution**: Emphasize the importance of maintaining a respectful tone. Demonstrate the difference between assertive and aggressive questioning.

2. **Challenge**: Students struggling to think of questions on the spot
   - **Solution**: Provide practice sessions where students brainstorm questions in advance. Teach techniques for quickly generating questions based on the opponent's speech.

3. **Challenge**: Responders giving long, evasive answers
   - **Solution**: Teach strategies for politely interrupting and redirecting. Practice concise answering techniques.

4. **Challenge**: Students feeling intimidated by the cross-examination process
   - **Solution**: Start with low-stakes practice rounds. Gradually increase difficulty. Provide positive reinforcement for participation.

5. **Challenge**: Difficulty in adapting cross-examination to Timorese cultural norms
   - **Solution**: Discuss cultural perspectives on questioning authority. Adapt examples to be culturally relevant and sensitive.

6. **Challenge**: Uneven skill levels within the class
   - **Solution**: Use peer mentoring. Pair more experienced students with beginners for practice sessions.

7. **Challenge**: Students focusing too much on "winning" rather than learning
   - **Solution**: Emphasize the educational value of the process. Reward good questions and answers, not just "victories" in the debate.
