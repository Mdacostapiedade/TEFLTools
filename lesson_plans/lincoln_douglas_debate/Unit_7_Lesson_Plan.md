# Lesson Plan: Flowing and Time Management in Lincoln-Douglas Debate

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Stopwatches or timer app (1 per pair of students)
- Handouts with sample debate arguments
- Video recording equipment (optional)
- Recorded sample debate (audio or video)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Take organized notes (flow) during a Lincoln-Douglas debate
- Allocate time effectively within speech time limits
- Identify and prioritize key arguments in a debate round

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

### Speed Note-Taking Challenge

1. Pair students up
2. One student reads a short paragraph about a current Timorese issue
3. The other student takes notes, trying to capture key points
4. Students switch roles with a new paragraph
5. Discuss as a class: What was challenging? What strategies did you use?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)

- Flow: The notes taken during a debate round
- Time allocation: How a debater divides their speaking time
- Signposting: Verbally indicating the structure of a speech
- Dropped argument: An argument left unaddressed by the opponent

## 5. Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)

### Flowing Techniques

- Explain the purpose of flowing: tracking arguments and responses
- Demonstrate a basic flowing structure on the whiteboard
- Show how to use abbreviations and symbols for efficiency
- Discuss strategies for organizing information on the flow sheet

### Time Management in Debate

- Explain the importance of using speaking time effectively
- Discuss general time allocation guidelines for each speech
- Demonstrate how to use hand signals or timers to track time
- Explain strategies for prioritizing arguments when time is limited

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Flowing Practice

1. Play a short (2-3 minute) clip from a sample debate
2. Students practice flowing the arguments
3. Compare flows with a partner, discussing differences
4. Repeat with another clip, focusing on improvement

### Time Management Drill

1. Provide students with a list of 5-7 arguments
2. Students have 3 minutes to address as many arguments as possible
3. Partners provide feedback on time usage and argument coverage
4. Repeat, encouraging students to improve their time allocation

## 7. Production Tasks (20 minutes)

### Mini-Debate with Focused Flowing

1. Divide class into groups of three: affirmative, negative, and judge
2. Provide a simple resolution relevant to Timor-Leste
3. Conduct 2-minute constructive speeches and 1-minute rebuttals
4. Judges focus on flowing the debate and providing feedback
5. Rotate roles and repeat

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Ask students to share one new flowing technique they learned
- Discuss common time management challenges and solutions
- Review key points about prioritizing arguments in limited time

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Watch a full Lincoln-Douglas debate online and practice flowing
2. Write a reflection (1 page) on:
   - Challenges faced in flowing the debate
   - Observations on how debaters managed their time
   - Strategies to improve personal flowing and time management skills

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Flow: A method of taking notes during a debate that tracks the progression of arguments and responses throughout the round.
- Time allocation: The way a debater divides their speaking time among different arguments and sections of their speech.
- Signposting: Verbally indicating the structure or organization of a speech to help the audience and judge follow the arguments.
- Dropped argument: An argument made by one side that the other side fails to address or refute in their following speech.
