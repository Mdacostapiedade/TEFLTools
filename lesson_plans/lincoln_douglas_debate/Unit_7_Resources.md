# Flowing and Time Management Resources

## 1. Short Paragraphs for Warm-up Activity

### Paragraph 1: Coffee Industry in Timor-Leste

Timor-Leste's coffee industry has been growing steadily in recent years. The country's high-altitude regions produce high-quality Arabica coffee, which is gaining recognition in international markets. However, challenges remain, including limited infrastructure, inconsistent quality control, and competition from other coffee-producing nations. The government and NGOs are working to support farmers through training programs and improved processing facilities.

### Paragraph 2: Education in Timor-Leste

Education in Timor-Leste has made significant progress since independence, but faces ongoing challenges. The literacy rate has improved, and more children are attending school. However, issues such as a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate facilities, and language barriers persist. The government has implemented policies to address these issues, including teacher training programs and efforts to balance the use of Portuguese and Tetum in instruction.

## 2. Lecture Notes

### Flowing Techniques

1. Purpose of flowing
   - Track arguments and responses throughout the debate
   - Create a visual map of the debate round
   - Aid in organizing rebuttal speeches

2. Basic flowing structure
   - Use a landscape-oriented page
   - Divide into columns for each speech
   - Leave space between arguments for responses

3. Abbreviations and symbols
   - Use standard abbreviations: b/c (because), w/ (with), govt (government)
   - Develop personal shorthand for common terms
   - Use arrows to show argument flow between speeches

4. Organization strategies
   - Group related arguments together
   - Use different colors for affirmative and negative points
   - Number main arguments for easy reference

### Time Management in Debate

1. Importance of effective time use
   - Ensures all key points are addressed
   - Maintains a balanced and comprehensive argument
   - Demonstrates preparation and skill to judges

2. Time allocation guidelines
   - Constructive speeches: 
     * Introduction: 30 seconds
     * Value/Criterion: 1 minute
     * Contentions: 3-4 minutes
     * Conclusion: 30 seconds
   - Rebuttal speeches:
     * Address opponent's case: 1-1.5 minutes
     * Defend own case: 1-1.5 minutes

3. Using timers and signals
   - Practice with a stopwatch or timer app
   - Arrange hand signals with a partner (e.g., 2 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds remaining)
   - Place a watch or timer where it's visible during the speech

4. Prioritizing arguments
   - Identify the most important points to address
   - Group similar arguments to address efficiently
   - Be prepared to drop less crucial points if time runs short

## 3. Discussion Questions

1. How does effective flowing contribute to success in a debate round?
2. What are some strategies for maintaining focus while flowing during a fast-paced debate?
3. How can time management skills developed in debate be applied to other areas of academic or professional life?
4. What are the potential consequences of poor time management in a debate round?
5. How might flowing techniques be adapted for taking notes in other classes or meetings?
6. What are some cultural considerations in Timor-Leste that might affect time management in public speaking?

## 4. Writing Exercise Instructions

### Flowing Practice Reflection

After completing the flowing practice activity:

1. Write a short paragraph (5-7 sentences) describing your experience with flowing.
2. Include:
   - Challenges you faced
   - Strategies that worked well for you
   - Areas where you need to improve
   - How you plan to practice and develop your flowing skills

### Time Management Strategy Development

1. Create a personal time management plan for a 5-minute Lincoln-Douglas speech.
2. Include:
   - A breakdown of how you would allocate time to different sections
   - Specific strategies you would use to stay on track
   - Contingency plans for if you fall behind or ahead of schedule
3. Write a brief explanation (3-4 sentences) justifying your choices.

## 5. Assignment Details

### Homework: Debate Analysis and Reflection

1. Watch a full Lincoln-Douglas debate online (provide links to suitable debates adapted for Timor-Leste context if available).
2. Practice flowing the entire debate.
3. Write a one-page reflection addressing the following points:
   - Specific challenges you faced while flowing the debate
   - Observations on how the debaters managed their time during speeches
   - At least three strategies you plan to implement to improve your personal flowing and time management skills
   - How these skills might be useful in other aspects of your academic or personal life

Submission: Bring your written reflection and flow sheets to the next class for discussion.
