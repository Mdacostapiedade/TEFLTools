## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

### Flowing Practice Worksheet

1. Listen to the provided debate clip and fill in the flow sheet below.
2. Use abbreviations and symbols to capture key points efficiently.
3. After the clip, compare your flow with a partner and discuss any differences.

[Include a blank flow sheet structure similar to the one in the visual aids section]

### Time Management Drill Worksheet

1. You have 3 minutes to address as many of the following arguments as possible:
   - [List 5-7 sample arguments relevant to a current Timorese issue]
2. Plan your time allocation below:
   - Argument 1: ___ seconds
   - Argument 2: ___ seconds
   [Continue for all arguments]
3. After the drill, reflect on:
   - Which arguments did you prioritize and why?
   - How could you improve your time management in the next round?

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to keep up with the speed of arguments in flowing.
   **Solution**: Start with slower, shorter practice clips and gradually increase speed and length. Encourage use of abbreviations and symbols.

2. **Challenge**: Students allocating too much time to less important arguments.
   **Solution**: Teach a framework for quickly assessing argument importance. Practice identifying key arguments in sample debates.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty in adapting flowing techniques to Tetum or other local languages.
   **Solution**: Work with students to develop language-specific abbreviations and flowing conventions. Create a class glossary of debate terms in local languages.

4. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by managing both content and time simultaneously.
   **Solution**: Break down the skills into smaller components. Practice content organization and time management separately before combining them.

5. **Challenge**: Lack of confidence in public speaking affecting time management.
   **Solution**: Incorporate regular speaking exercises that focus on pacing and delivery. Provide a supportive environment for practice and feedback.

6. **Challenge**: Limited access to technology for timing or recording debates.
   **Solution**: Teach manual time-keeping methods and encourage peer timing. Use role-play and live practice debates when recording equipment is unavailable.
