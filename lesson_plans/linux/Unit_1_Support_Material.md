## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students with varying levels of computer experience
   - Tip: Pair more experienced students with beginners for peer support. Provide extra practice exercises for advanced students.

2. Challenge: Technical issues with Linux installation or virtual machines
   - Tip: Prepare a troubleshooting guide for common issues. Have a few live USB drives with Linux ready as a backup.

3. Challenge: Students feeling overwhelmed by the command line interface
   - Tip: Start with simple, practical examples. Emphasize the power and efficiency of CLI through real-world scenarios.

4. Challenge: Difficulty understanding Linux file system structure
   - Tip: Use visual aids and analogies to explain the hierarchy. Provide hands-on exercises for students to explore the file system.

5. Challenge: Language barriers in understanding technical terms
   - Tip: Create a glossary of terms in both English and Tetum. Use visual representations where possible to reinforce concepts.

6. Challenge: Limited internet access for downloading resources
   - Tip: Prepare offline resources in advance, including documentation and practice materials. Consider setting up a local network repository for software packages.
