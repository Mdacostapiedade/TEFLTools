# Lesson Plan: Introduction to the Lymphatic System

## Resources Needed
- Anatomical charts of the lymphatic system
- Handouts with blank diagrams of the lymphatic system
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector for PowerPoint presentation
- Sticky notes

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Describe the basic anatomy of the lymphatic system
2. Explain at least three functions of the lymphatic system
3. Identify common lymphatic disorders in Timor-Leste
4. Relate local beliefs about swelling and fluid retention to lymphatic health

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Think-Pair-Share: Ask students to think about what they know about the body's drainage system. Have them pair up and share their ideas, then discuss as a class.

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)
Write the following terms on the board and briefly explain each:
- Lymph
- Lymph nodes
- Lymphatic vessels
- Interstitial fluid
- Edema

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Lymphatic System Anatomy
   - Use anatomical charts to show the major components of the lymphatic system
   - Explain the structure and location of lymph nodes, vessels, and organs

2. Functions of the Lymphatic System
   - Fluid balance
   - Immune defense
   - Fat absorption

3. Common Lymphatic Disorders in Timor-Leste
   - Lymphedema
   - Lymphatic filariasis
   - Post-surgical swelling

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)
1. Labeling Activity (15 minutes)
   - Distribute handouts with blank diagrams of the lymphatic system
   - Have students work in pairs to label major components

2. Group Discussion (15 minutes)
   - Divide class into small groups
   - Assign each group a topic: local beliefs about swelling, fluid retention, or "bad blood"
   - Have groups discuss and record their ideas on sticky notes
   - Groups present their findings to the class

## Production Task (20 minutes)
- Create a simple poster explaining one function of the lymphatic system
- Students can work in pairs or small groups
- Posters should include both text and visuals

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
- Quick quiz: Ask students to write down three new things they learned about the lymphatic system
- Address any misconceptions or questions that arose during the lesson

## Homework Assignment
- Research a common lymphatic disorder in Timor-Leste
- Write a one-page summary including:
  1. Description of the disorder
  2. Common symptoms
  3. How it relates to lymphatic system function

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
1. Lymph: Clear, colorless fluid that circulates through the lymphatic system
2. Lymph nodes: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and contain immune cells
3. Lymphatic vessels: Network of thin tubes that carry lymph throughout the body
4. Interstitial fluid: Fluid between cells in tissues
5. Edema: Swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in body tissues
