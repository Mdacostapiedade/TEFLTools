# Lesson Plan: Principles of Manual Lymphatic Drainage

## Resources Needed
- Illustrated manual of MLD techniques (translated into Tetum)
- Anatomical charts of the lymphatic system
- Practice mats or tables for hands-on sessions
- Projector and screen for demonstrations
- Handouts on MLD history and basic techniques

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain the basic theory behind MLD
2. Demonstrate the correct pressure and basic strokes used in MLD
3. Identify indications and contraindications for MLD
4. Perform basic MLD techniques on a partner

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Pair discussion: Students share their experiences or knowledge of massage techniques used in Timorese traditional medicine
- Class sharing: Pairs report back, instructor notes similarities and differences with MLD on the board

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)
Introduce and explain key terms:
- Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD)
- Lymph
- Lymphatic vessels
- Lymph nodes
- Edema
- Contraindication

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Brief history of MLD development (5 minutes)
2. Explanation of MLD theory and how it differs from traditional massage (10 minutes)
3. Demonstration of basic MLD strokes and correct pressure (15 minutes)
   - Stationary circles
   - Pump technique
   - Rotary technique
   - Scoop technique

## Practice Activities (40 minutes)
1. Guided practice: Students follow instructor in performing basic MLD strokes on their own arms (15 minutes)
2. Pair practice: Students take turns practicing MLD techniques on each other's arms and hands, with instructor circulating to provide feedback (25 minutes)

## Production Tasks (30 minutes)
1. Small group activity: Groups of 3-4 students create a poster listing indications and contraindications for MLD (15 minutes)
2. Group presentations: Each group presents their poster to the class, explaining their choices (15 minutes)

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
1. Q&A session: Students ask questions about MLD techniques or theory
2. Quick quiz: Instructor asks true/false questions about key MLD principles, students respond with thumbs up/down

## Homework Assignment
1. Read handout on MLD history and basic techniques
2. Practice basic MLD strokes on self for 10 minutes daily
3. Write a short reflection (1 paragraph) on how MLD might be integrated with traditional Timorese healing practices

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD): A gentle massage technique designed to stimulate the flow of lymph fluid
- Lymph: A clear, colorless fluid containing white blood cells that bathes the tissues and drains through the lymphatic system into the bloodstream
- Lymphatic vessels: The network of thin tubes that carry lymph throughout the body
- Lymph nodes: Small structures located along lymphatic vessels that filter lymph and store white blood cells
- Edema: Swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body's tissues
- Contraindication: A condition or factor that serves as a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment due to the harm that it would cause the patient
