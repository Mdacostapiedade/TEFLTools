# Lesson Plan: MLD for Upper Body

## Resources Needed
- Anatomical charts of upper body lymphatic system
- Massage tables or mats
- Pillows and towels
- Hand sanitizer
- Illustrated handouts of MLD sequences (in Tetum)
- Whiteboard and markers

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Perform basic MLD techniques for the neck, shoulder, and arm
2. Explain the MLD sequence for upper body to patients in Tetum
3. Identify cultural considerations when performing MLD on the upper body
4. Demonstrate adaptations of MLD techniques for Timorese patients

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Pair discussion: Students share experiences of giving or receiving massage in Timorese culture
- Class sharing: Instructor facilitates brief discussion on cultural attitudes towards touch in healthcare

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)
- Introduce and explain key terms in Tetum and English:
  * Lymph nodes (nódulu linfátiku)
  * Drainage pathways (dalan drenajen)
  * Gentle pressure (presaun suave)
  * Circular motions (movimentu sirkulár)
- Students practice pronouncing terms and match Tetum-English flashcards

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Review anatomy of upper body lymphatic system using charts
2. Demonstrate MLD sequence for neck and shoulder:
   - Explain and show each movement
   - Highlight importance of gentle pressure and direction
3. Demonstrate MLD sequence for arm and hand:
   - Show proper hand placement and stroke techniques
   - Emphasize differences from traditional massage
4. Discuss cultural considerations:
   - Modesty concerns
   - Gender sensitivities
   - Incorporating traditional healing concepts

## Practice Activities (45 minutes)
1. Paired practice: Students take turns performing neck and shoulder MLD
2. Small group rotation: Practice arm and hand MLD under instructor supervision
3. Role-play: Students explain MLD process to each other in Tetum

## Production Tasks (30 minutes)
1. Group presentations: Each group demonstrates a complete upper body MLD sequence
2. Peer feedback: Students evaluate each other's technique and communication

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Q&A session: Address student questions and clarify any misunderstandings
- Quick quiz: Students identify correct hand placements and stroke directions on diagrams

## Homework Assignment
1. Practice upper body MLD sequence on a family member or friend
2. Write a short reflection (in Tetum) on cultural adaptations needed for MLD in their community
3. Prepare a simple patient education script in Tetum for explaining upper body MLD

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD): A gentle massage technique to encourage lymph flow
- Lymph nodes: Small structures that filter lymph and contain immune cells
- Drainage pathways: Routes that lymph follows through the body
- Gentle pressure: Light touch used in MLD, typically described as the weight of a coin
- Circular motions: Round movements used in some MLD strokes
- Modesty: Cultural norms regarding body coverage and exposure
- Adaptation: Modifying techniques to suit local cultural or individual needs
