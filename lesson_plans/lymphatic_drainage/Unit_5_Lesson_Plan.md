# Lesson Plan: MLD for Specific Conditions

## Resources Needed
- Anatomical charts of the lymphatic system
- Illustrated manual of MLD techniques (translated into Tetum)
- Practice mats or tables for hands-on sessions
- Handouts on common conditions (post-surgical swelling, chronic venous insufficiency, lymphatic filariasis)
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector for presentations (if available)

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Apply MLD techniques to common health issues in Timor-Leste
2. Develop treatment plans incorporating MLD for specific conditions
3. Demonstrate proper MLD techniques for post-surgical swelling, chronic venous insufficiency, and lymphatic filariasis

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Quick quiz: Students pair up and quiz each other on basic MLD techniques learned in previous units
- Class discussion: Share experiences of encountering patients with swelling or lymphatic issues in their practice

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)
Introduce and explain key terms:
- Post-surgical swelling
- Chronic venous insufficiency
- Lymphatic filariasis
- Treatment plan
- Contraindications

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Overview of MLD for specific conditions
2. Post-surgical swelling:
   - Causes and symptoms
   - MLD techniques and precautions
3. Chronic venous insufficiency:
   - Pathophysiology
   - MLD approach and benefits
4. Lymphatic filariasis:
   - Prevalence in Timor-Leste
   - MLD strategies for management

## Practice Activities (45 minutes)
1. Divide class into three groups, each focusing on one condition
2. Groups review case studies and develop MLD treatment plans
3. Groups practice MLD techniques specific to their assigned condition

## Production Tasks (45 minutes)
1. Group presentations:
   - Each group presents their treatment plan and demonstrates MLD techniques for their assigned condition
   - Q&A session after each presentation

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
1. Summarize key points for each condition
2. Address any remaining questions or concerns
3. Quick review quiz on main concepts covered

## Homework Assignment
1. Develop a detailed MLD treatment plan for a hypothetical patient with one of the conditions discussed
2. Research and write a short report on another lymphatic condition common in Timor-Leste and how MLD might be beneficial

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Post-surgical swelling: Edema that occurs after a surgical procedure
- Chronic venous insufficiency: A condition where veins have difficulty returning blood from the legs to the heart
- Lymphatic filariasis: A parasitic disease that can cause severe swelling in the limbs and genitals
