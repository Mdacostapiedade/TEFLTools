# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Marine Ecosystems of Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Large map of Timor-Leste
- Colored markers or pins
- Whiteboard and markers
- Laptops or tablets with internet access (1 per group)
- Handouts with images of key marine habitats
- "Coral Reef Fishes of Timor-Leste" by Gerald R. Allen and Mark V. Erdmann

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe the geographical features of Timor-Leste's coastline and marine territories
- Identify and explain the importance of key marine habitats in Timor-Leste
- Locate major marine ecosystems on a map of Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to share their experiences with local marine environments
- Conduct a quick poll: "How many of you have visited a coral reef? A mangrove forest? A seagrass bed?"
- Briefly discuss the importance of these ecosystems to local communities

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Write the following terms on the whiteboard and briefly explain each:
- Coral reef
- Mangrove
- Seagrass bed
- Biodiversity
- Ecosystem
- Marine territory

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of Timor-Leste's coastline and marine territories
  * Show map of Timor-Leste, highlighting the coastline and surrounding waters
  * Discuss the country's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
  * Explain Timor-Leste's position within the Coral Triangle

- Key marine habitats in Timor-Leste
  * Coral reefs: distribution, types, and ecological importance
  * Mangroves: location, species diversity, and ecosystem services
  * Seagrass beds: distribution, species composition, and ecological role

- Importance of these habitats
  * Biodiversity hotspots
  * Coastal protection
  * Fish nurseries
  * Carbon sequestration

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Divide the class into small groups
- Provide each group with a map of Timor-Leste and colored markers
- Ask groups to research and mark the locations of major coral reefs, mangrove forests, and seagrass beds on their maps
- Have groups add notes about the characteristics and importance of each habitat

## 7. Production Task (20 minutes)

- Each group presents their completed map to the class
- Groups explain their choices for habitat locations and share interesting facts they discovered during their research

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Conduct a quick quiz using the following questions:
  1. Name three important marine habitats in Timor-Leste.
  2. Why are coral reefs important for Timor-Leste?
  3. What ecosystem services do mangroves provide?
  4. Where is Timor-Leste located in relation to the Coral Triangle?

- Address any misconceptions or questions that arose during the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:
  1. The importance of coral reefs to Timor-Leste's economy and environment
  2. Challenges facing mangrove conservation in Timor-Leste
  3. The role of seagrass beds in supporting local fisheries

- Students should include at least three references in their essay

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Coral reef: A diverse underwater ecosystem characterized by reef-building corals
- Mangrove: A tree or shrub that grows in coastal saline or brackish water
- Seagrass bed: An underwater ecosystem dominated by flowering plants adapted to marine environments
- Biodiversity: The variety of life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
- Ecosystem: A community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment
- Marine territory: The area of sea over which a country has jurisdiction or sovereign rights
- Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ): A sea zone prescribed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea over which a state has special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources
