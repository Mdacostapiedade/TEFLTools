## Overview of Timor-Leste's Coastline and Marine Territories

### Geographical Features
- Timor-Leste has approximately 735 km of coastline
- Located in the Coral Triangle, a global center of marine biodiversity
- Shares maritime borders with Indonesia and Australia

### Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
- Timor-Leste's EEZ extends 200 nautical miles from its coastline
- Total area of approximately 77,051 kmÂ²
- Rich in marine resources, including fish stocks and potential oil and gas reserves

### Coral Triangle
- Timor-Leste is part of the Coral Triangle, along with Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, and Solomon Islands
- Known as the "Amazon of the Seas" due to its exceptional marine biodiversity
- Home to 76% of the world's coral species and more than 3,000 fish species

## Key Marine Habitats in Timor-Leste

### Coral Reefs
- Fringing reefs along most of the coastline
- Major reef areas: Atauro Island, Jaco Island, and the Oecusse enclave
- Support over 400 species of hard corals
- Provide habitat for diverse fish communities and other marine life

### Mangroves
- Approximately 1,300 hectares of mangrove forests
- Major mangrove areas: Metinaro, Hera, and Com
- At least 19 mangrove species recorded in Timor-Leste
- Provide crucial ecosystem services such as coastal protection and fish nurseries

### Seagrass Beds
- Extensive seagrass meadows along the north coast
- Important areas: Atauro Island, Batugade, and Suai
- At least 5 seagrass species recorded in Timor-Leste
- Critical habitat for dugongs and sea turtles

## Importance of Marine Habitats

### Biodiversity
- Coral reefs: support thousands of species of fish, invertebrates, and other marine life
- Mangroves: provide habitat for unique flora and fauna adapted to brackish environments
- Seagrass beds: support diverse communities of fish, invertebrates, and marine mammals

### Coastal Protection
- Coral reefs: act as natural barriers, reducing wave energy and protecting coastlines from erosion
- Mangroves: stabilize shorelines, reduce erosion, and protect coastal communities from storm surges

### Fish Nurseries
- All three habitats serve as important nursery grounds for many fish species
- Provide shelter and food for juvenile fish, supporting fisheries productivity

### Carbon Sequestration
- Mangroves and seagrass beds are highly effective at capturing and storing carbon dioxide
- Play a crucial role in mitigating climate change impacts

# Discussion Questions

1. How does Timor-Leste's location within the Coral Triangle influence its marine biodiversity?
2. What are the main threats to coral reefs in Timor-Leste, and how might these impact local communities?
3. How do mangrove forests contribute to both environmental protection and local livelihoods?
4. Why are seagrass beds important for marine conservation in Timor-Leste?
5. How might climate change affect Timor-Leste's marine ecosystems, and what can be done to increase their resilience?
6. What role do traditional ecological knowledge and practices play in the conservation of marine habitats in Timor-Leste?
7. How can the development of marine protected areas benefit both biodiversity conservation and local communities in Timor-Leste?
8. What are the potential conflicts between economic development and marine conservation in Timor-Leste, and how might these be addressed?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. The importance of coral reefs to Timor-Leste's economy and environment
2. Challenges facing mangrove conservation in Timor-Leste
3. The role of seagrass beds in supporting local fisheries

Your essay should include:
- An introduction that clearly states your topic and main argument
- At least three main points supporting your argument
- Specific examples or case studies from Timor-Leste
- A conclusion that summarizes your key points and offers insights for future conservation efforts
- At least three references from reputable sources (scientific journals, government reports, or NGO publications)

Use proper citation format (e.g., APA or MLA) for your references.

# Assignment Details

## Map Creation of Timor-Leste's Marine Habitats

### Objectives:
- Identify and locate major marine ecosystems in Timor-Leste
- Understand the distribution of key marine habitats along the coastline
- Practice research and map-making skills

### Materials:
- Large map of Timor-Leste (provided)
- Colored markers or pins
- Internet-connected devices for research

### Instructions:
1. Form groups of 3-4 students
2. Using the provided map of Timor-Leste, mark the locations of:
   - Major coral reef areas
   - Significant mangrove forests
   - Known seagrass beds
3. Use different colors or symbols for each habitat type
4. Add brief notes to your map about the characteristics or importance of each marked location
5. Include a legend explaining your color/symbol choices
6. Prepare a short (3-5 minute) presentation explaining your map to the class

### Grading Criteria:
- Accuracy of habitat locations (30%)
- Completeness of map (including all three habitat types) (20%)
