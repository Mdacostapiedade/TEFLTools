# Support Material for Introduction to Marine Ecosystems of Timor-Leste

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Coral reef: A diverse underwater ecosystem characterized by reef-building corals
- Mangrove: A tree or shrub that grows in coastal saline or brackish water
- Seagrass bed: An underwater ecosystem dominated by flowering plants adapted to marine environments
- Biodiversity: The variety of life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
- Ecosystem: A community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment
- Marine territory: The area of sea over which a country has jurisdiction or sovereign rights
- Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ): A sea zone prescribed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea over which a state has special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources
- Coral Triangle: A marine area located in the western Pacific Ocean, known for its high marine biodiversity
- Ecosystem services: The benefits people obtain from ecosystems
- Carbon sequestration: The process of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Map of Timor-Leste:
   - Large map showing the coastline, major cities, and surrounding waters
   - Highlight the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
   - Mark the country's position within the Coral Triangle

2. Marine Habitat Diagram:
   - Cross-section view of the coastline showing:
     * Coral reef zones (reef flat, reef crest, fore reef)
     * Mangrove forest with root systems
     * Seagrass bed
   - Label key features and organisms in each habitat

3. Ecosystem Services Infographic:
   - Visual representation of ecosystem services provided by:
     * Coral reefs (e.g., coastal protection, tourism, fisheries)
     * Mangroves (e.g., carbon sequestration, nursery habitat, erosion control)
     * Seagrass beds (e.g., sediment stabilization, nutrient cycling, fish habitat)

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Marine Habitat Identification Sheet:
   - Images of coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds from Timor-Leste
   - Brief descriptions of each habitat's characteristics
   - Space for students to note key features and importance

2. Map Activity Worksheet:
   - Outline map of Timor-Leste's coastline
   - Instructions for marking major marine habitats
   - Questions prompting students to explain their habitat placement choices

3. Marine Ecosystem Quiz:
   - Multiple-choice and short-answer questions covering key concepts from the lesson
   - Include questions on habitat characteristics, importance, and geographical distribution

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Limited student experience with marine environments:
   - Use plenty of visual aids and videos to bring the ecosystems to life
   - Organize a field trip to a local coastal area if possible

2. Difficulty understanding complex ecological concepts:
   - Use analogies to familiar terrestrial ecosystems
   - Employ hands-on activities and games to reinforce concepts

3. Language barriers:
   - Provide key vocabulary in both English and Tetum
   - Use visual aids to support explanations

4. Limited access to technology:
   - Prepare printed materials as backups for online resources
   - Encourage group work to share available devices

5. Misconceptions about marine conservation:
   - Address common myths and misconceptions directly
   - Invite local experts or fishers to share their knowledge and experiences

6. Engaging students with varying levels of interest:
   - Incorporate local cultural knowledge and practices related to marine resources
   - Use diverse teaching methods to cater to different learning styles

7. Difficulty in visualizing underwater habitats:
   - Use 3D models or dioramas if available
   - Encourage students to create their own artistic representations of marine habitats
