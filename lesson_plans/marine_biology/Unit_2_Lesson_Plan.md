# Lesson Plan: Marine Biodiversity in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- "Coral Reef Fishes of Timor-Leste" by Gerald R. Allen and Mark V. Erdmann
- "A Field Guide to Tropical Reef Fishes of the Indo-Pacific" by Gerald R. Allen
- Laminated fish and coral identification cards
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Blank paper and colored pencils for food web diagrams

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify at least 10 common marine species found in Timor-Leste waters
- Explain the ecological roles of 5 key species in the local marine ecosystem
- Create a basic food web diagram for a Timorese marine ecosystem

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display images of various marine species found in Timor-Leste waters
- Ask students to share any personal experiences or knowledge about these species
- Conduct a quick poll on which species students find most interesting and why

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Biodiversity
- Ecosystem
- Food web
- Keystone species
- Endemic species
- Pelagic
- Benthic
- Coral polyp
- Symbiosis

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Fish Diversity in Timor-Leste
- Overview of fish families common in Timor-Leste waters
- Highlight endemic species and their importance
- Discuss the roles of herbivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous fish in the ecosystem

### Coral Species and Their Importance
- Introduction to hard and soft corals found in Timor-Leste
- Explain the role of corals as ecosystem engineers
- Discuss coral-fish relationships and their ecological significance

### Marine Mammals and Reptiles
- Overview of whale, dolphin, and dugong species in Timorese waters
- Discuss the presence and importance of sea turtles
- Explain the roles of these larger animals in the marine ecosystem

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### Species Identification Exercise (20 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with laminated identification cards and guidebooks
- Have students practice identifying species and discussing their characteristics

### Food Web Creation (20 minutes)
- Introduce the concept of a food web using a simple example
- Assign each group a specific Timorese marine habitat (e.g., coral reef, seagrass bed)
- Have groups create a food web diagram for their assigned habitat

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

### Group Presentations
- Each group presents their food web diagram to the class
- Groups explain the ecological relationships they've identified
- Encourage questions and discussion from other students

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Conduct a quick quiz on species identification and ecological roles
- Review key points about marine biodiversity in Timor-Leste
- Discuss the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem health and human well-being

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research one marine species found in Timor-Leste and prepare a one-page report on its ecological role, habitat requirements, and any conservation concerns
- Begin compiling a personal field guide of Timorese marine species, to be continued throughout the course

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Biodiversity: The variety of life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
- Ecosystem: A community of living organisms interacting with their environment
- Food web: A system of interlocking and interdependent food chains
- Keystone species: A species that has a disproportionately large effect on its environment relative to its abundance
- Endemic species: A species that is unique to a particular geographic location
- Pelagic: Relating to the open ocean
- Benthic: Relating to the bottom of a body of water
- Coral polyp: The small, soft-bodied organisms that make up coral colonies
- Symbiosis: A close and long-term biological interaction between two different biological organisms
