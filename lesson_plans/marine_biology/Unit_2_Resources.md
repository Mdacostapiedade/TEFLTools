# Lecture Notes

## Fish Diversity in Timor-Leste

### Overview of Fish Families
- Timor-Leste's waters host over 800 reef fish species
- Common families include:
  * Pomacentridae (damselfishes and clownfishes)
  * Labridae (wrasses)
  * Scaridae (parrotfishes)
  * Acanthuridae (surgeonfishes and unicornfishes)
  * Chaetodontidae (butterflyfishes)
  * Serranidae (groupers)

### Endemic Species
- Several endemic species found in Timor-Leste, including:
  * Timor Damselfish (Pomacentrus cf. amboinensis)
  * Atauro Cardinalfish (Ostorhinchus atauroensis)
- Importance of endemics:
  * Indicators of unique evolutionary history
  * Often adapted to specific local conditions
  * High conservation value

### Ecological Roles
- Herbivorous fish (e.g., parrotfish, surgeonfish):
  * Control algal growth on coral reefs
  * Contribute to reef resilience
- Carnivorous fish (e.g., groupers, snappers):
  * Top-down control of prey populations
  * Maintain ecosystem balance
- Omnivorous fish (e.g., some wrasses, damselfishes):
  * Diverse diets contribute to nutrient cycling
  * Often play roles in cleaning symbiosis

## Coral Species and Their Importance

### Hard and Soft Corals
- Hard corals (Scleractinia):
  * Primary reef-builders
  * Common genera: Acropora, Porites, Montipora
- Soft corals (Alcyonacea):
  * Provide habitat complexity
  * Common genera: Sarcophyton, Sinularia, Lobophytum

### Corals as Ecosystem Engineers
- Create three-dimensional habitat structure
- Provide shelter for diverse marine life
- Contribute to coastal protection by reducing wave energy

### Coral-Fish Relationships
- Obligate corallivores (e.g., some butterflyfishes)
- Coral-dwelling species (e.g., certain gobies, damselfish)
- Symbiotic relationships (e.g., clownfish and anemones)

## Marine Mammals and Reptiles

### Whales and Dolphins
- Species observed in Timorese waters:
  * Sperm whales
  * Blue whales
  * Various dolphin species (e.g., spinner, bottlenose)
- Ecological roles:
  * Top predators in marine food webs
  * Nutrient cycling through vertical migration

### Dugongs
- Herbivorous marine mammals
- Feed primarily on seagrasses
- Important for maintaining seagrass ecosystem health

### Sea Turtles
- Species found in Timor-Leste:
  * Green sea turtle
  * Hawksbill turtle
  * Leatherback turtle
- Ecological roles:
  * Seagrass bed maintenance (green turtles)
  * Sponge control on reefs (hawksbill turtles)
  * Jellyfish population control (leatherback turtles)

# Discussion Questions

1. How does fish diversity contribute to the overall health of coral reef ecosystems in Timor-Leste?
2. What are the potential consequences of losing endemic species in Timor-Leste's waters?
3. Discuss the importance of herbivorous fish in maintaining coral reef resilience. How might overfishing of these species impact reef ecosystems?
4. How do corals function as ecosystem engineers, and why is this role crucial for marine biodiversity?
5. Compare and contrast the ecological roles of whales, dugongs, and sea turtles in Timor-Leste's marine ecosystems.
6. How might climate change impact the marine biodiversity of Timor-Leste, particularly considering coral reefs and their associated species?
7. Discuss the potential cascading effects of removing a keystone species from a Timorese marine ecosystem.
8. How can understanding marine biodiversity in Timor-Leste contribute to more effective conservation strategies?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Marine Species Profile

1. Choose one marine species found in Timor-Leste waters.
2. Research the species using credible sources, including scientific literature and field guides.
3. Write a 500-word profile of the species, including:
   - Scientific and common names
   - Physical description
   - Habitat preferences
   - Diet and feeding behavior
   - Reproductive strategies
   - Ecological role in Timorese marine ecosystems
   - Any known conservation concerns or threats
   - Interesting facts or unique adaptations
4. Include a properly cited image of the species.
5. Provide a list of references used in your research.

# Assignment Details

## Food Web Diagram and Analysis

1. Create a detailed food web diagram for a specific Timorese marine ecosystem (e.g., coral reef, seagrass bed, mangrove forest).
2. Include at least 15 species in your food web, representing various trophic levels.
3. Use arrows to show energy flow between species.
4. Color-code organisms by their trophic level (e.g., green for producers, yellow for primary consumers, etc.).
5. Write a 750-word analysis of your food web, addressing the following points:
   - Identify and explain the roles of producers, consumers, and decomposers in your food web.
   - Discuss any keystone species present and their importance to the ecosystem.
   - Explain at least three examples of species interactions (e.g., predation, competition, symbiosis) illustrated in your food web.
   - Hypothesize how the removal of one species might affect the entire food web, providing specific examples of potential cascading effects.
   - Discuss how understanding this food web can inform conservation efforts in Timor-Leste.
6. Submit both the food web diagram and the written analysis.
