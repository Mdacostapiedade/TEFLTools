# Support Material for Marine Biodiversity in Timor-Leste Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Biodiversity**: The variety of life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
- **Ecosystem**: A community of living organisms interacting with their environment
- **Food web**: A system of interlocking and interdependent food chains
- **Keystone species**: A species that has a disproportionately large effect on its environment relative to its abundance
- **Endemic species**: A species that is unique to a particular geographic location
- **Pelagic**: Relating to the open ocean
- **Benthic**: Relating to the bottom of a body of water
- **Coral polyp**: The small, soft-bodied organisms that make up coral colonies
- **Symbiosis**: A close and long-term biological interaction between two different biological organisms

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Map of Timor-Leste's Marine Habitats**
   - A color-coded map showing the distribution of coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangrove forests along the coast of Timor-Leste

2. **Common Fish Families Infographic**
   - Visual representation of common fish families found in Timor-Leste waters, including silhouettes and key identifying features

3. **Coral Reef Ecosystem Diagram**
   - Cross-section diagram of a coral reef, highlighting different zones and common species found in each

4. **Marine Food Web Poster**
   - A simplified food web diagram showing key species and their relationships in Timor-Leste's marine ecosystem

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Species Identification Worksheet**
   - Images of 15-20 common marine species found in Timor-Leste
   - Space for students to write the species name and one key identifying feature
   - Multiple-choice questions about the ecological role of each species

2. **Food Web Creation Activity Sheet**
   - List of 20 marine species found in Timor-Leste
   - Instructions for creating a food web diagram
   - Blank space for students to draw their food web
   - Reflection questions about the relationships they've identified

3. **Marine Habitat Comparison Chart**
   - Table with columns for coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangroves
   - Rows for characteristics such as primary producers, common species, and ecosystem services
   - Students fill in the chart based on lesson content and additional research

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "The Ecology of Fishes on Coral Reefs" edited by Peter F. Sale
2. "Coral Reefs of the World" by Charles Sheppard
3. iNaturalist app for species identification practice
4. Coral Reef Alliance website (www.coral.org) for educational resources
5. World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) database for taxonomic information

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with scientific names of species.
   **Solution**: Focus on common names and family-level identification. Introduce scientific names gradually and relate them to easier-to-remember characteristics.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to live specimens or field trips.
   **Solution**: Use high-quality images, videos, and virtual reality resources. Consider partnering with local aquariums or marine research centers for specimen loans or virtual tours.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty in understanding complex ecological relationships.
   **Solution**: Start with simple food chains before introducing more complex food webs. Use physical props or interactive digital tools to visualize relationships.

4. **Challenge**: Varying levels of prior knowledge among students.
   **Solution**: Conduct a pre-lesson assessment to gauge student knowledge. Provide additional resources for students who need more background and challenge activities for advanced learners.

5. **Challenge**: Connecting local biodiversity to global conservation issues.
   **Solution**: Use case studies that link Timor-Leste's marine ecosystems to broader regional and global conservation efforts, such as the Coral Triangle Initiative.
