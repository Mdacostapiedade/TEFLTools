# Lesson Plan: Threats to Marine Ecosystems in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer
- Whiteboard and markers
- Printed case studies of local environmental issues
- Poster paper and colored markers for group presentations
- Handouts with key vocabulary and concepts

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify at least three major threats to Timor-Leste's marine environment
- Explain the impact of human activities on local marine ecosystems
- Analyze a case study of a local environmental issue
- Propose potential solutions to marine threats

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display images of healthy and degraded marine ecosystems in Timor-Leste
- Ask students to discuss in pairs what differences they observe and potential causes

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (15 minutes)

- Introduce and define key terms:
  - Overfishing
  - Destructive fishing practices
  - Coastal development
  - Marine pollution
  - Climate change
  - Ocean acidification
- Use visual aids and local examples to illustrate each concept

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overfishing and destructive fishing practices
  - Discuss current fishing practices in Timor-Leste
  - Explain impacts on fish populations and ecosystem balance
- Coastal development and pollution
  - Present examples of coastal development projects
  - Discuss types of pollution affecting marine ecosystems
- Climate change impacts on Timor-Leste's marine environment
  - Explain rising sea temperatures and coral bleaching
  - Discuss sea level rise and impacts on coastal communities

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Divide class into small groups
- Distribute case studies of local environmental issues (e.g., coral reef damage, mangrove deforestation)
- Groups analyze their case study, identifying:
  - The main threat(s) to the ecosystem
  - Causes of the threat(s)
  - Current and potential impacts on the ecosystem and local communities

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

- Groups prepare a short presentation on their case study analysis
- Presentations should include:
  - Summary of the environmental issue
  - Identified threats and their causes
  - Impacts on the ecosystem and community
  - Proposed solutions to address the threat(s)
- Each group presents to the class (5-7 minutes per group)

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Facilitate a class discussion on common themes across presentations
- Create a mind map on the whiteboard summarizing the main threats and potential solutions
- Review key vocabulary and concepts

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students write a 500-word reflection on the most pressing threat to Timor-Leste's marine ecosystems and propose three specific actions to address it

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Overfishing: Catching fish faster than they can reproduce, leading to depletion of fish populations
- Destructive fishing practices: Methods that damage marine habitats, such as dynamite fishing or bottom trawling
- Coastal development: Construction of buildings, roads, and infrastructure along coastlines
- Marine pollution: Introduction of harmful substances or materials into the marine environment
- Climate change: Long-term alteration of global weather patterns and temperatures due to human activities
- Ocean acidification: Decrease in the pH of the ocean caused by absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
