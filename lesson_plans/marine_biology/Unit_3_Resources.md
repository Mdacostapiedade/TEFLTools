# Lecture Notes

## Overfishing and Destructive Fishing Practices

### Current Fishing Practices in Timor-Leste
- Subsistence fishing: Small-scale, traditional methods using hand lines, nets, and small boats
- Commercial fishing: Increasing presence of larger vessels, both domestic and foreign
- Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing: A significant issue in Timor-Leste's waters

### Impacts on Fish Populations and Ecosystem Balance
- Depletion of target species: e.g., tuna, grouper, snapper
- Disruption of food chains: Removal of predators or prey species affects entire ecosystem
- Bycatch: Unintended capture of non-target species, including endangered species
- Habitat destruction: Bottom trawling and dynamite fishing damage coral reefs and seabed habitats

### Destructive Fishing Methods
- Dynamite fishing: Use of explosives to stun or kill fish
- Cyanide fishing: Use of sodium cyanide to stun fish for the aquarium trade
- Bottom trawling: Dragging heavy nets across the seafloor, damaging habitats

## Coastal Development and Pollution

### Examples of Coastal Development Projects in Timor-Leste
- Port expansion in Dili
- Coastal road construction
- Tourism infrastructure development

### Impacts of Coastal Development
- Habitat loss: Destruction of mangroves, seagrass beds, and coastal vegetation
- Sedimentation: Increased runoff and erosion affecting coral reefs and water quality
- Alteration of coastal processes: Changes in sediment transport and shoreline dynamics

### Types of Marine Pollution Affecting Timor-Leste
- Plastic pollution: Discarded fishing gear, single-use plastics, microplastics
- Agricultural runoff: Pesticides, fertilizers, and sediment from farming practices
- Sewage and wastewater: Lack of proper treatment facilities in coastal areas
- Oil and chemical spills: Risks from increased maritime traffic and offshore exploration

### Effects of Pollution on Marine Ecosystems
- Eutrophication: Excess nutrients leading to algal blooms and oxygen depletion
- Bioaccumulation: Concentration of pollutants in marine food chains
- Habitat degradation: Smothering of coral reefs and seagrass beds by sediment and algae

## Climate Change Impacts on Timor-Leste's Marine Environment

### Rising Sea Temperatures
- Coral bleaching: Loss of symbiotic algae due to heat stress
- Changes in species distribution: Migration of fish and other marine life to cooler waters
- Increased frequency of marine heatwaves

### Ocean Acidification
- Reduction in seawater pH due to absorption of atmospheric CO2
- Impacts on calcifying organisms: Corals, mollusks, and some plankton species
- Potential disruption of marine food webs

### Sea Level Rise
- Coastal erosion and inundation of low-lying areas
- Saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers
- Threats to coastal infrastructure and communities

### Extreme Weather Events
- Increased intensity of tropical cyclones
- Storm surge and coastal flooding
- Damage to coastal and marine habitats

# Discussion Questions

1. How do traditional fishing practices in Timor-Leste compare to modern commercial fishing methods in terms of sustainability?

2. What are the potential long-term consequences of overfishing on Timor-Leste's economy and food security?

3. How might coastal development projects be designed to minimize their impact on marine ecosystems?

4. What role can local communities play in monitoring and reducing marine pollution?

5. How might climate change impacts on marine ecosystems affect traditional livelihoods in Timor-Leste?

6. What are some potential strategies for increasing the resilience of Timor-Leste's coastal communities to sea level rise?

7. How can Timor-Leste balance the need for economic development with marine conservation goals?

8. What are some examples of successful marine conservation initiatives from other countries that could be adapted for Timor-Leste?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Essay on Marine Threats

Write a 500-word reflection on what you consider to be the most pressing threat to Timor-Leste's marine ecosystems. Your essay should include:

1. An introduction clearly stating which threat you believe is most pressing and why.
2. A brief explanation of the threat, including its causes and current impacts.
3. A discussion of potential future consequences if the threat is not addressed.
4. Three specific, actionable proposals to address the threat, considering local context and resources.
5. A conclusion summarizing your main points and reiterating the importance of addressing this threat.

Use evidence from class discussions, readings, and your own observations to support your arguments. Be sure to consider both ecological and socioeconomic factors in your analysis.

# Assignment Details

## Case Study Analysis and Presentation

### Objective
To analyze a real-world environmental issue affecting Timor-Leste's marine ecosystems and propose potential solutions.

### Instructions
1. In groups of 3-4, you will be assigned a case study of a local environmental issue.
2. Read and analyze the case study, identifying:
   - The main threat(s) to the ecosystem
   - Causes of the threat(s)
   - Current and potential impacts on the ecosystem and local communities
3. Prepare a 5-7 minute presentation that includes:
   - A summary of the environmental issue
   - Identified threats and their causes
   - Impacts on the ecosystem and community
   - At least three proposed solutions to address the threat(s)
4. Create a visual aid (e.g., poster, PowerPoint) to support your presentation
5. Be prepared to answer questions from the class and instructor

### Grading Criteria
- Accuracy and depth of analysis (30%)
- Quality and feasibility of proposed solutions (30%)
- Clarity and organization of presentation (20%)
- Visual aid effectiveness (10%)
- Group collaboration and time management (10%)

# Additional Materials

## Case Study Example: Coral Reef Damage in Atauro Island

Atauro Island, located north of Dili, is known for its rich marine biodiversity and pristine coral reefs. However, in recent years, local dive operators and fishers have reported increasing damage to coral reefs in popular diving and fishing areas.

Observations include:
- Broken coral fragments on the seafloor
- Algal overgrowth on some reef sections
- Decreased fish abundance in affected areas
- Anchor damage from boats in shallow reef areas

Local community members report:
- Increased number of tourism boats visiting the area
- Some instances of illegal fishing by foreign vessels
- Changes in local fishing practices, with some using larger nets
- Warmer water temperatures during recent summers

Your task is to analyze this case study, identify the main threats to the coral reef ecosystem, and propose potential solutions that consider both environmental protection and the needs of the local community.
