Here's the support material for the lesson plan on "Threats to Marine Ecosystems in Timor-Leste," formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Lesson: Threats to Marine Ecosystems in Timor-Leste

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Overfishing**: Catching fish faster than they can reproduce, leading to depletion of fish populations
- **Destructive fishing practices**: Methods that damage marine habitats, such as dynamite fishing or bottom trawling
- **Coastal development**: Construction of buildings, roads, and infrastructure along coastlines
- **Marine pollution**: Introduction of harmful substances or materials into the marine environment
- **Climate change**: Long-term alteration of global weather patterns and temperatures due to human activities
- **Ocean acidification**: Decrease in the pH of the ocean caused by absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
- **Ecosystem balance**: The stable state of an ecosystem where all elements are in harmony
- **Coral bleaching**: The process where corals expel their symbiotic algae due to stress, often caused by rising sea temperatures
- **Mangrove deforestation**: The removal of mangrove forests, often for coastal development or aquaculture

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Healthy vs. Degraded Ecosystem Comparison**:
   - Two side-by-side images showing a healthy coral reef ecosystem teeming with diverse fish and coral species, contrasted with a degraded ecosystem featuring bleached corals, algal overgrowth, and few fish.

2. **Threats to Marine Ecosystems Infographic**:
   - A visual representation of the main threats discussed in the lesson, including icons for overfishing, coastal development, pollution, and climate change, with arrows showing their impacts on marine life.

3. **Climate Change Impact Diagram**:
   - A flowchart illustrating the process of climate change impacts on marine ecosystems, from increased CO2 emissions to ocean warming, sea level rise, and coral bleaching.

4. **Coastal Development Impact Illustration**:
   - A before-and-after sketch of a coastal area, showing the transformation from a natural coastline with mangroves to a developed area with buildings, roads, and visible pollution sources.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Case Study Analysis Worksheet**:
   - Title: Local Environmental Issue Analysis
   - Sections:
     - Issue Description
     - Main Threat(s) Identified
     - Causes of the Threat(s)
     - Current Impacts on Ecosystem
     - Potential Future Impacts
     - Proposed Solutions
   - Space for notes and sketches

2. **Marine Threat Identification Activity**:
   - A series of images depicting various marine environments in Timor-Leste
   - Students identify and label threats visible in each image
   - Questions prompting students to explain the potential impacts of each identified threat

3. **Solution Brainstorming Template**:
   - Divided into sections for different threats (e.g., overfishing, pollution, climate change)
   - Prompts for students to list potential solutions at individual, community, and government levels

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "State of the Coral Triangle: Timor-Leste" report by the Asian Development Bank
2. WorldFish Center's resources on small-scale fisheries in Timor-Leste
3. Coral Triangle Initiative website (www.coraltriangleinitiative.org)
4. NOAA's "Coral Reef Conservation" educational materials
5. WWF's "Coral Triangle" program resources
6. Local news articles on recent environmental issues in Timor-Leste's marine areas

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited prior knowledge of marine ecosystems.
   - **Solution**: Begin with a basic overview of marine ecosystems and gradually introduce more complex concepts. Use plenty of visual aids and local examples.

2. **Challenge**: Some students might not see the immediate relevance of marine conservation to their lives.
   - **Solution**: Emphasize the connection between healthy marine ecosystems and local livelihoods, food security, and cultural practices in Timor-Leste.

3. **Challenge**: Technical vocabulary might be difficult for some students.
   - **Solution**: Create a word wall with key terms and their definitions. Regularly review and use these terms throughout the lesson.

4. **Challenge**: Students may feel overwhelmed by the scale of environmental threats.
   - **Solution**: Focus on local, actionable solutions and success stories to maintain a sense of hope and empowerment.

5. **Challenge**: Varying levels of English proficiency among students.
   - **Solution**: Provide handouts with key information in both English and Tetum. Encourage peer explanations and group discussions in their preferred language.

6. **Challenge**: Limited access to technology for presentations.
   - **Solution**: Have alternative non-digital presentation methods ready, such as poster paper and markers for group work.
