# Lesson Plan: Marine Conservation Strategies in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Printed maps of Timor-Leste's coastline
- Colored pencils or markers
- Flipchart paper
- Handouts on different conservation strategies
- Access to internet for research (if available)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify and describe at least three different marine conservation strategies
- Explain the concept and purpose of marine protected areas (MPAs)
- Analyze the effectiveness of community-based conservation initiatives in Timor-Leste
- Evaluate national and international conservation policies relevant to Timor-Leste
- Design a basic marine protected area plan for a local site

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display images of healthy and degraded marine ecosystems in Timor-Leste
- Ask students to discuss in pairs:
  1. What differences do you notice between these ecosystems?
  2. What might have caused these differences?
  3. How could we prevent or reverse the degradation?
- Share responses as a class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Marine Protected Area (MPA)
- No-take zone
- Sustainable use
- Biodiversity hotspot
- Stakeholder engagement
- Ecosystem-based management

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### a. Marine Protected Areas in Timor-Leste
- Definition and purpose of MPAs
- Types of MPAs (no-take, multi-use, etc.)
- Current MPAs in Timor-Leste (e.g., Nino Konis Santana National Park)
- Benefits and challenges of implementing MPAs

### b. Community-based Conservation Initiatives
- Importance of local involvement in conservation
- Examples of successful community-led projects in Timor-Leste
- Tara Bandu: traditional Timorese conservation practices

### c. National and International Conservation Policies
- Timor-Leste's national marine conservation policies
- Relevant international agreements (e.g., Convention on Biological Diversity)
- Role of regional initiatives (e.g., Coral Triangle Initiative)

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### a. MPA Design Exercise (25 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a map of a section of Timor-Leste's coastline
- Task: Design a hypothetical marine protected area for the given site
  - Identify key habitats and species to protect
  - Determine boundaries and zones (no-take, sustainable use, etc.)
  - Consider local community needs and potential conflicts

### b. Conservation Strategy Comparison (15 minutes)
- In the same groups, have students create a pros and cons list for:
  1. Marine Protected Areas
  2. Community-based conservation initiatives
  3. National/international policies
- Share findings with the class

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

Debate: "Are MPAs the most effective conservation strategy for Timor-Leste?"
- Divide the class into two teams: for and against
- Give teams 10 minutes to prepare arguments
- Conduct a 15-minute debate
- 5-minute class discussion on the key points raised

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the main conservation strategies discussed
- Ask students to share one new thing they learned and one question they still have
- Address any remaining questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research a successful marine conservation project from another developing country
- Write a 1-page summary explaining:
  1. The conservation strategy used
  2. Why it was successful
  3. How a similar approach could be applied in Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Marine Protected Area (MPA): A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values.

- No-take zone: An area where the removal of marine life is strictly prohibited.

- Sustainable use: The use of components of biological diversity in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity.

- Biodiversity hotspot: A biogeographic region with significant levels of biodiversity that is threatened by human habitation.

- Stakeholder engagement: The process by which an organization involves people who may be affected by the decisions it makes or can influence the implementation of its decisions.

- Ecosystem-based management: An integrated approach to management that considers the entire ecosystem, including humans, with the goal of maintaining an ecosystem in a healthy, productive and resilient condition.
