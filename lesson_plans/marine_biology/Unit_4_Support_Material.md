Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Marine Conservation Strategies in Timor-Leste, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Marine Conservation Strategies in Timor-Leste

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Marine Protected Area (MPA)**: A clearly defined geographical space in the ocean, managed through legal or other effective means, to achieve long-term conservation of nature and associated ecosystem services.

- **No-take zone**: An area within an MPA where the removal of marine life is strictly prohibited.

- **Sustainable use**: The use of marine resources in a way that maintains biodiversity and ecosystem functions while meeting present needs without compromising future generations.

- **Biodiversity hotspot**: A biogeographic region with significant levels of biodiversity that is under threat from human activities.

- **Stakeholder engagement**: The process of involving people or groups who may be affected by or can influence marine conservation decisions.

- **Ecosystem-based management**: An integrated approach to marine resource management that considers entire ecosystems, including humans, to maintain healthy, productive, and resilient conditions.

- **Tara Bandu**: A traditional Timorese practice of setting rules or prohibitions to regulate natural resource use and social behavior.

- **Coral Triangle**: A marine area in the western Pacific Ocean that includes the waters of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, and the Solomon Islands, known for its exceptional marine biodiversity.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited student knowledge of marine ecosystems
   - Tip: Begin with a brief overview of Timor-Leste's marine habitats and key species. Use visual aids and local examples to make the content more relatable.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in understanding complex conservation strategies
   - Tip: Use simplified explanations and real-world examples. Incorporate hands-on activities like the MPA design exercise to reinforce understanding.

3. Challenge: Lack of engagement in debate activity
   - Tip: Provide clear guidelines and structure for the debate. Assign roles within teams (e.g., researcher, speaker) to ensure all students participate.

4. Challenge: Limited access to up-to-date information on Timor-Leste's marine conservation efforts
   - Tip: Reach out to local NGOs or government agencies for recent reports or data. Encourage students to conduct interviews with community members or local experts.

5. Challenge: Difficulty in relating global conservation concepts to local context
   - Tip: Consistently draw connections between international strategies and local practices. Highlight traditional conservation methods like Tara Bandu and discuss their modern applications.

6. Challenge: Varying levels of English proficiency
   - Tip: Provide key vocabulary in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and hands-on activities to support understanding. Encourage peer explanations and group discussions.
