# Support Material for Sustainable Fisheries Management in Timor-Leste Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Sustainable yield**: The level at which a natural resource can be used without long-term depletion
- **Bycatch**: Unwanted marine creatures caught during commercial fishing for a different species
- **Overfishing**: Catching fish faster than they can reproduce, leading to population decline
- **Mesh size**: The size of the openings in a fishing net, which determines the size of fish that can be caught
- **Closed seasons**: Periods when fishing of certain species is prohibited to allow for reproduction and population recovery
- **Quota systems**: Limits on the amount of fish that can be caught within a specific time period
- **Artisanal fishing**: Small-scale, traditional fishing practices typically used by local communities
- **Semi-industrial fishing**: Fishing operations that are larger than artisanal but smaller than industrial scale
- **Industrial fishing**: Large-scale commercial fishing operations using advanced technology and large vessels
- **Pole-and-line fishing**: A sustainable fishing method where fish are caught individually using a pole, line, and hook
- **Trap fishing**: Using stationary nets or cages to catch fish, often considered more sustainable than active fishing methods

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Sustainable vs. Unsustainable Fishing Methods Comparison Chart**
   - A side-by-side comparison of sustainable and unsustainable fishing methods, including images and brief descriptions of each method.

2. **Timor-Leste Fisheries Sector Infographic**
   - Visual representation of key statistics on fish production, employment, and economic contribution of the fisheries sector in Timor-Leste.

3. **Sustainable Fishing Gear Diagram**
   - Illustrations of sustainable fishing gear types relevant to Timor-Leste, including pole-and-line, traps, and sustainable net configurations.

4. **Fisheries Regulation Timeline**
   - A visual timeline showing the implementation of key fisheries regulations and international agreements in Timor-Leste.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Sustainable Fishing Methods Checklist**
   - A list of fishing methods with checkboxes for students to mark as sustainable or unsustainable, with space for explanations.

2. **Fisheries Regulation Analysis Worksheet**
   - A table listing key fisheries regulations in Timor-Leste, with columns for students to note the regulation's purpose, potential benefits, and challenges in implementation.

3. **Community Fisheries Management Plan Template**
   - A structured template for students to use when developing their sustainable fisheries management plans, including sections for current practices assessment, proposed methods, community engagement strategies, and monitoring plans.

4. **Local Fisher Interview Guide**
   - A set of questions for students to use when interviewing local fishers or fish market vendors, covering topics such as fishing practices, challenges faced, and perceptions of sustainability.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barriers**
   - Challenge: Students may struggle with technical terms in English.
   - Solution: Provide a glossary with local language translations and use visual aids to reinforce concepts.

2. **Limited Local Data**
   - Challenge: Up-to-date data on Timor-Leste's fisheries may be scarce.
   - Solution: Encourage students to conduct their own local research and observations. Use case studies from similar countries when local data is unavailable.

3. **Conflicting Views on Traditional vs. Modern Practices**
   - Challenge: Students may have differing opinions on traditional fishing methods versus modern sustainable practices.
   - Solution: Facilitate respectful discussions, emphasizing the importance of balancing tradition with sustainability. Encourage students to find ways to incorporate traditional knowledge into modern conservation efforts.

4. **Limited Access to Technology**
   - Challenge: Some students may have limited access to computers or the internet for research.
   - Solution: Provide printed resources and encourage group work to share available technology. Organize field trips to local libraries or resource centers if possible.

5. **Engaging Students with Varied Fishing Experience**
   - Challenge: Students may have different levels of familiarity with fishing practices.
   - Solution: Use peer teaching opportunities, pairing students with fishing experience with those who have less. Incorporate hands-on activities and field trips to level the playing field.
