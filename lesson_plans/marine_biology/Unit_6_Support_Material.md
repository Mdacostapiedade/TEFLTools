## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Limited local examples**: 
   - Challenge: Timor-Leste may have few established ecotourism projects to draw from.
   - Solution: Use examples from similar countries in Southeast Asia and discuss how they could be adapted to the Timorese context.

2. **Language barriers**: 
   - Challenge: Some students may struggle with English terminology.
   - Solution: Provide a glossary of key terms in both English and Tetum, and encourage peer explanations.

3. **Varying levels of environmental awareness**: 
   - Challenge: Students may have different levels of understanding about environmental issues.
   - Solution: Start with a brief assessment of existing knowledge and adjust the lesson content accordingly.

4. **Limited internet access**: 
   - Challenge: Research activities may be difficult if internet access is unreliable.
   - Solution: Prepare offline resources such as printed articles, reports, and case studies.

5. **Balancing economic and conservation perspectives**: 
   - Challenge: Students may focus more on economic benefits than conservation.
   - Solution: Emphasize the long-term economic benefits of conservation and use role-playing exercises to explore different stakeholder perspectives.

6. **Engaging students with different learning styles**: 
   - Challenge: The lesson involves various activities that may not suit all learning styles.
   - Solution: Incorporate a mix of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic activities, and allow students to choose roles in group work that suit their strengths.
