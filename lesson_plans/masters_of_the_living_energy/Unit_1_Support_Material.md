## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to understand abstract spiritual concepts.
   - **Tip**: Use concrete examples and personal anecdotes to illustrate ideas. Encourage students to relate concepts to their own experiences.

2. **Challenge**: Cultural appropriation concerns when adapting Andean practices to Timorese context.
   - **Tip**: Emphasize respect and cultural exchange rather than appropriation. Discuss the importance of preserving the integrity of both traditions while exploring similarities.

3. **Challenge**: Students may have differing religious backgrounds and beliefs.
   - **Tip**: Create a respectful, open environment for discussion. Frame the lesson as an exploration of cultural worldviews rather than promoting any specific belief system.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in pronouncing Quechua or Timorese terms.
   - **Tip**: Provide a pronunciation guide and practice key terms as a class. Encourage students to help each other with pronunciation.

5. **Challenge**: Limited access to resources on Timorese spirituality.
