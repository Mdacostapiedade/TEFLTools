## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Cultural sensitivity**: Be mindful of appropriation concerns. Emphasize respect and cultural context when practicing adapted rituals.

2. **Language barriers**: Provide clear definitions and visual aids for Quechua and Timorese terms. Consider creating a glossary handout.

3. **Skepticism**: Some students may be skeptical of shamanic practices. Encourage open-mindedness and focus on cultural and anthropological aspects.

4. **Varied background knowledge**: Students may have different levels of familiarity with the topic. Use the warm-up activity to gauge knowledge and adjust accordingly.

5. **Time management**: The role-play activity may take longer than expected. Have a shortened version ready if needed.

6. **Emotional reactions**: Some students may have strong emotional responses to the content. Be prepared to offer support and create a safe space for discussion.

7. **Lack of resources**: If certain ceremonial items are unavailable, encourage creative substitutions that respect the spirit of the practice.

8. **Connecting to local context**: Continuously draw parallels between Andean and Timorese practices to maintain relevance for students.
