### Activity 1: Threat Analysis (20 minutes)
- In small groups, students create a mind map of threats to a specific Timorese spiritual practice
- Groups present their findings to the class

### Activity 2: Preservation Strategies Brainstorm (20 minutes)
- Using the "World Caf√©" method, students rotate between stations to brainstorm preservation strategies for different aspects of indigenous wisdom (e.g., healing practices, rituals, language)

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

- Students work in pairs to develop a proposal for preserving a specific Timorese spiritual practice
- Proposals should include:
  - Description of the practice

  - Preservation strategies
  - Plan for adaptation to modern context

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Gallery walk: Students post their proposals and review others' work
- Class discussion on common themes and innovative ideas

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Create an educational resource (e.g., infographic, short video, podcast) that explains an Andean concept using Timorese cultural references
