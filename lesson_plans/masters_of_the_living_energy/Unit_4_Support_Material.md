## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may have limited knowledge of their own cultural traditions.
   Solution: Encourage students to interview family members or community elders before the lesson to gather information about traditional practices.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in drawing parallels between Andean and Timorese traditions.
   Solution: Provide specific examples of similar concepts or practices from both cultures, and guide students in identifying underlying principles rather than surface-level similarities.

3. Challenge: Students may view traditional practices as outdated or irrelevant.
   Solution: Highlight contemporary applications of indigenous wisdom, such as in sustainable agriculture or mental health practices, to demonstrate its ongoing relevance.

4. Challenge: Sensitivity around discussing sacred or secret knowledge.
   Solution: Establish clear guidelines for respectful discussion and emphasize that the focus is on general principles rather than revealing protected cultural information.

5. Challenge: Varying levels of comfort with spiritual or energetic concepts.
   Solution: Frame discussions in terms of cultural worldviews and philosophies rather than requiring personal belief or participation in spiritual practices.

6. Challenge: Time management for group activities.
   Solution: Assign specific roles within groups (e.g., timekeeper, note-taker) and provide clear time limits for each phase of group work.

7. Challenge: Ensuring equal participation in discussions.
   Solution: Use techniques like round-robin sharing or think-pair-share to encourage input from all students.
