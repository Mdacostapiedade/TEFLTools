# Excerpts and Short Stories

## From "Masters of the Living Energy" by Joan Parisi Wilcox

### On Saminchakuy

"Saminchakuy is a fundamental Andean energy practice that involves releasing heavy energy, or hucha, from your poq'po (energy body). To perform saminchakuy, you first connect with Pachamama (Mother Earth) by visualizing roots growing from your feet deep into the earth. Then, starting from your head, you use your hands to brush down your body, imagining that you are sweeping away heavy energy. As you reach your feet, visualize the hucha flowing into the earth, where it will be transformed back into sami (light energy) by Pachamama."

### On Hucha Mikhuy

"Hucha mikhuy, or 'eating' heavy energy, is an advanced technique practiced by Andean paqos (mystics). Unlike saminchakuy, which releases hucha, hucha mikhuy involves transmuting heavy energy within one's own being. The paqo draws hucha into their qosqo (energy center near the navel), where it is 'digested' and transformed back into sami. This practice requires a strong connection to kawsay pacha (the living energy) and a deep understanding of energy dynamics."

1. Describe your physical and emotional sensations during the saminchakuy practice.
2. How did your understanding of energy change after learning about Andean concepts?
3. Compare your experience with Andean techniques to any Timorese practices you're familiar with.
4. Reflect on how these practices might be integrated into your daily life.
5. Discuss any challenges or insights you encountered during the exercises.

# Assignment Details

## Design a Personal Cleansing Ritual

Create a personal cleansing ritual that incorporates elements from both Andean and Timorese traditions. Your ritual should include:

1. A clear intention or purpose for the ritual
2. At least one Andean technique (e.g., saminchakuy)
3. At least one element inspired by Timorese purification practices
4. Use of local plants or materials
5. A component that honors the concept of ayni (reciprocity)

Write a 2-page description of your ritual, explaining each step and its significance. Include a brief rationale for how you've combined the two traditions and any adaptations you've made to suit the local context.

## Sample Despacho Ceremony Adapted for Timorese Context

A despacho is an Andean offering ceremony. Here's a simplified version adapted for Timor-Leste:

1. Create a base using a large banana leaf.
2. Place symbols of the three worlds: a feather (upper world), a seed (middle world), and a stone (lower world).
3. Add local flowers, grains, and sweets as offerings.
4. Include symbols of personal intentions written on small pieces of paper.
5. Wrap the offering in the banana leaf, tying it with natural fiber.
6. Burn or bury the despacho while offering prayers of gratitude.
