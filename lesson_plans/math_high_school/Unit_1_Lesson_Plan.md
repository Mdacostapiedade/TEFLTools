# Lesson Plan: Foundations of Mathematics Education in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Sample Timorese math textbooks (various grade levels)
- Handouts with Timorese education system overview
- Flip chart paper and markers for group work
- Projector and computer (if available)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe the current state of mathematics education in Timor-Leste
- Identify at least three cultural and linguistic factors influencing math learning in Timor-Leste
- Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of current math textbooks used in Timorese schools

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Students reflect on their own experiences learning mathematics in Timor-Leste, then share with a partner, and finally with the whole class.
- Guiding questions: What was challenging? What was helpful? How did language impact your learning?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)

Write and explain the following terms on the board:
- Curriculum
- Bilingual education
- Mother tongue instruction
- Ethnomathematics

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Overview of Timorese Education System and Math Curriculum
- Brief history of education in Timor-Leste
- Current structure of the education system
- Overview of the national mathematics curriculum for secondary education

### Language Considerations in Math Education
- Official languages: Tetum and Portuguese
- Role of local languages in early math education
- Challenges of transitioning between languages in math instruction

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### Activity 1: Education System Analysis (20 minutes)
- In small groups, students create a visual representation (diagram or flowchart) of the Timorese education system using provided handouts.
- Groups present their visuals, discussing how mathematics fits into each level of education.

### Activity 2: Textbook Evaluation (20 minutes)
- In pairs, students examine sample math textbooks, focusing on:
  1. Language used
  2. Cultural relevance of examples and problems
  3. Clarity of explanations
  4. Types of exercises and activities
- Pairs share their findings with the class, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.

## 7. Production Task (20 minutes)

Students work individually to create a one-page proposal outlining:
1. One major challenge in Timorese math education
2. A potential solution to address this challenge
3. How this solution considers cultural and linguistic factors

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Class discussion: What are the most pressing issues in mathematics education in Timor-Leste?
- Quick review of key points covered in the lesson
- Students share one new insight they gained from the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will:
1. Interview a family member or community elder about their experience with mathematics education.
2. Write a 1-2 page reflection comparing the interviewee's experience with current math education practices in Timor-Leste.
3. Prepare three questions for further discussion in the next class based on their interview and reflection.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Curriculum: The subjects comprising a course of study in a school or college.
- Bilingual education: A system of education where instruction is given in two languages.
