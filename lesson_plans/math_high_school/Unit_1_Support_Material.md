## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barriers**:
   - Use visual aids and manipulatives to support understanding
   - Encourage peer translation and explanation
   - Develop a classroom math vocabulary wall in multiple languages

2. **Limited Resources**:
   - Utilize locally available materials for hands-on activities
   - Encourage resource sharing among teachers and schools
   - Adapt online resources for offline use when internet is unavailable

3. **Cultural Relevance**:
   - Collaborate with local community members to gather culturally relevant examples
   - Incorporate traditional games and practices into math lessons
   - Be sensitive to cultural norms when designing group activities or using certain examples

4. **Mixed Ability Classrooms**:
   - Implement differentiated instruction techniques
   - Use peer tutoring and collaborative learning strategies
   - Provide extension activities for advanced students and additional support for struggling learners

5. **Engaging Students**:
   - Connect math concepts to real-life situations in Timor-Leste
   - Use storytelling and local history to introduce mathematical ideas
   - Incorporate physical activities and outdoor learning when possible

6. **Assessment Challenges**:
   - Use a variety of assessment methods beyond traditional tests
   - Implement ongoing formative assessment to track progress
   - Consider language proficiency when assessing mathematical understanding
