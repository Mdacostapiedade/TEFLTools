# Lesson Plan: Diverse Teaching Approaches in Mathematics

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with sample math problems
- Manipulatives (e.g., base-10 blocks, geometric shapes)
- Flip chart paper and markers for group work
- Projector and computer (if available)
- Copies of Timorese math textbooks

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, participants will be able to:
- Identify at least three student-centered learning approaches for math instruction
- Demonstrate a collaborative learning technique through a micro-teaching session
- Create a lesson plan that incorporates diverse teaching strategies suitable for Timorese classrooms

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Participants reflect on their most memorable math lesson as a student. What made it memorable? Share with a partner, then discuss as a class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Student-centered learning
- Collaborative learning
- Cooperative learning
- Differentiation
- Scaffolding

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of student-centered learning approaches in mathematics
  - Inquiry-based learning
  - Problem-based learning
  - Discovery learning
- Introduction to collaborative and cooperative learning techniques
  - Jigsaw method
  - Think-Pair-Share
  - Round Robin
- Strategies for adapting teaching methods to Timorese contexts
  - Using local materials and examples
  - Addressing language considerations
  - Incorporating cultural elements

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

- Small Group Work: Divide participants into groups of 4-5. Each group selects a math concept from the Timorese secondary curriculum and designs a 10-minute lesson using one of the student-centered approaches discussed.

- Gallery Walk: Groups post their lesson plans on flip chart paper around the room. Participants circulate, review other groups' plans, and provide feedback using sticky notes.

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Micro-teaching Sessions: Each group presents their 10-minute lesson to the class, demonstrating the chosen student-centered approach.

- Peer Feedback: After each micro-teaching session, participants provide constructive feedback on the effectiveness of the teaching strategy and its suitability for Timorese classrooms.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Whole Class Discussion: Reflect on the strengths and challenges of implementing diverse teaching approaches in Timorese math classrooms.
- Quick Write: Participants write down one new strategy they plan to implement in their own teaching and why.

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Create a detailed lesson plan for a 45-minute math lesson that incorporates at least two different student-centered or collaborative learning techniques. The lesson should be tailored to a specific grade level and topic from the Timorese math curriculum.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Student-centered learning: An approach to education focusing on the needs of the students, rather than those of others involved in the educational process.
- Collaborative learning: An educational approach involving groups of students working together to solve a problem, complete a task, or create a product.
- Cooperative learning: A specific kind of collaborative learning where students work together in small groups on a structured activity.
- Differentiation: Tailoring instruction to meet individual needs of students.
- Scaffolding: A teaching method that enables a student to solve a problem, carry out a task, or achieve a goal through a gradual shedding of outside assistance.
