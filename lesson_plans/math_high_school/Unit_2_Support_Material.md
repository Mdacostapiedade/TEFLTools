# Support Material for Diverse Teaching Approaches in Mathematics

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Student-centered learning**: An approach to education focusing on the needs of the students, rather than those of others involved in the educational process.
- **Collaborative learning**: An educational approach involving groups of students working together to solve a problem, complete a task, or create a product.
- **Cooperative learning**: A specific kind of collaborative learning where students work together in small groups on a structured activity.
- **Differentiation**: Tailoring instruction to meet individual needs of students.
- **Scaffolding**: A teaching method that enables a student to solve a problem, carry out a task, or achieve a goal through a gradual shedding of outside assistance.
- **Inquiry-based learning**: A form of active learning that starts by posing questions, problems or scenarios rather than simply presenting established facts.
- **Problem-based learning**: A student-centered approach where students learn about a subject by working in groups to solve an open-ended problem.
- **Discovery learning**: An inquiry-based learning method in which students interact with their environment by exploring and manipulating objects, wrestling with questions and controversies, or performing experiments.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Student-Centered vs. Teacher-Centered Learning Diagram**
   (Description: A side-by-side comparison showing the flow of information and interaction in both approaches. In the student-centered side, arrows point from students to each other and to the teacher, while in the teacher-centered side, arrows mainly point from the teacher to the students.)

2. **Collaborative Learning Techniques Flowchart**
   (Description: A flowchart showing the steps of implementing Jigsaw, Think-Pair-Share, and Round Robin techniques, with brief explanations of each step.)

3. **Adapting Teaching Methods to Timorese Context Infographic**
   (Description: An infographic showcasing local materials, language considerations, and cultural elements that can be incorporated into math lessons, with visual examples and brief explanations.)

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Collaborative Learning Technique Planning Sheet**
   Content: A template for teachers to plan a lesson using one of the collaborative learning techniques discussed. Includes sections for:
   - Chosen technique
   - Math concept to be taught
   - Step-by-step implementation plan
   - Materials needed
   - Assessment strategy

2. **Student-Centered Approach Evaluation Rubric**
   Content: A rubric for participants to use when evaluating their peers' micro-teaching sessions. Criteria include:
   - Effectiveness of chosen approach
   - Student engagement
   - Clarity of instructions
   - Relevance to Timorese context
   - Time management

3. **Adapting Math Problems Worksheet**
   Content: A set of generic math problems with space for participants to rewrite them using local contexts and examples relevant to Timorese students.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barriers**
   - Tip: Use visual aids and manipulatives to support verbal explanations
   - Tip: Develop a math word wall with terms in both Tetum and Portuguese

2. **Limited Resources**
   - Tip: Utilize locally available materials for hands-on activities (e.g., seeds, stones for counting)
   - Tip: Encourage students to create their own math manipulatives using recycled materials

3. **Large Class Sizes**
   - Tip: Implement peer tutoring systems to provide additional support
   - Tip: Use group work strategies to manage activities in large classes

4. **Varying Skill Levels**
   - Tip: Provide tiered assignments that allow students to work at their own pace
   - Tip: Use flexible grouping to match students with appropriate challenges

5. **Cultural Relevance**
   - Tip: Collaborate with local community members to identify relevant math applications
   - Tip: Incorporate traditional Timorese games and art into math lessons

6. **Resistance to New Teaching Methods**
   - Tip: Gradually introduce new techniques alongside familiar methods
   - Tip: Share success stories and evidence of improved student outcomes with colleagues and administrators
