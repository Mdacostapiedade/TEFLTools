# Lesson Plan: Practical Applications and Problem-Solving in Timorese Mathematics

## Resources Needed
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with local industry scenarios (agriculture, fishing, etc.)
- Calculators
- Graph paper
- Polya's problem-solving steps poster

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify mathematical concepts in real-world Timorese contexts
2. Apply Polya's problem-solving method to local scenarios
3. Create contextually relevant math problems based on Timorese industries

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
1. Display images of local Timorese industries (e.g., rice farming, fishing, coffee production)
2. Ask students to brainstorm in pairs: "What mathematical concepts might be involved in these industries?"
3. Share ideas as a class, creating a mind map on the whiteboard

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)
Introduce and explain key terms:
- Context
- Application
- Problem-solving
- Industry
- Variable

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)
1. Introduce the importance of applying mathematics to real-world situations
2. Present Polya's problem-solving method:
   a. Understand the problem
   b. Devise a plan
   c. Carry out the plan
   d. Look back and reflect
3. Demonstrate the method using a sample problem from Timorese agriculture:
   "A farmer has 1000 square meters of land. He wants to plant rice on 3/4 of the land and corn on the remaining 1/4. How many square meters will be used for each crop?"

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)
1. Divide students into small groups
2. Distribute handouts with different local industry scenarios
3. Groups apply Polya's method to solve their assigned problem
4. Circulate to provide guidance and support

## Production Tasks (30 minutes)
1. Each group creates their own math problem based on a Timorese industry
2. Groups exchange problems and solve each other's creations using Polya's method
3. Class discussion on the effectiveness of the problems and solutions

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
1. Recap the key steps of Polya's problem-solving method
2. Discuss how contextualizing math problems can make them more relevant and engaging
3. Quick quiz: Students match industry scenarios with appropriate mathematical concepts

## Homework Assignment
1. Create two math problems based on everyday situations in your community
2. Solve each problem using Polya's method, showing all steps clearly
3. Reflect on how the context helped or challenged your problem-solving process

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
