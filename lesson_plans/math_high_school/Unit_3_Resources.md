  * Increased engagement
  * Better understanding of real-world applications
  * Cultural relevance and preservation

### Identifying Mathematical Concepts in Local Industries
1. Agriculture

### Steps to Contextualize Math Problems
1. Identify the mathematical concept to be taught
2. Research local industries or situations where this concept applies
3. Develop a realistic scenario that incorporates the math concept
4. Ensure the problem is age-appropriate and culturally sensitive
5. Include relevant details that make the problem authentic

### Examples of Contextualized Problems
1. Rice Farming Problem:
   "A farmer in Baucau has a rectangular rice field measuring 50 meters by 30 meters. He needs to build a fence around the entire field. How many meters of fencing material will he need?"

2. Fishing Industry Problem:
   "A fishing cooperative in Dili caught 250 kg of fish on Monday, 180 kg on Tuesday, and 320 kg on Wednesday. What was the average daily catch for these three days?"

3. Coffee Export Problem:
   "A coffee plantation in Ermera produces 1500 kg of coffee beans. If 80% of the beans are exported and the rest are sold locally, how many kilograms are sold in each market?"

## Developing Critical Thinking Through Mathematical Reasoning

### Introduction to Critical Thinking in Mathematics
- Definition of critical thinking in mathematical context
- Importance of reasoning skills in problem-solving

### Key Components of Mathematical Reasoning
1. Analyzing information
2. Identifying patterns and relationships
3. Making conjectures and forming hypotheses
4. Constructing logical arguments
5. Evaluating solutions and methods

### Strategies to Promote Critical Thinking
1. Encourage multiple solution methods
2. Ask open-ended questions
3. Promote discussion and debate
4. Use real-world problems with no clear answers
5. Incorporate error analysis activities

### Polya's Problem-Solving Method
1. Understand the problem
   - Read carefully
   - Identify known and unknown information
   - Determine conditions and constraints
2. Devise a plan
   - Consider various strategies
   - Break down complex problems
   - Look for patterns or similar problems
3. Carry out the plan
   - Implement the chosen strategy
   - Check each step
   - Be prepared to try a different approach if needed
4. Look back and reflect
   - Verify the solution
   - Consider alternative methods
   - Reflect on the process and learning

### Applying Polya's Method to a Timorese Context
Example Problem: "A tais weaver can complete a traditional cloth in 12 days working alone. If she works with her daughter, they can complete the cloth in 8 days. How long would it take the daughter to weave the cloth by herself?"

1. Understand the problem:
   - Known: Time for weaver alone (12 days), time for weaver and daughter together (8 days)
   - Unknown: Time for daughter alone
   - Condition: Assumes consistent work rate

2. Devise a plan:
   - Use the concept of work rate
   - Set up an equation relating the work rates

3. Carry out the plan:
   - Let x be the number of days the daughter takes alone
   - Weaver's daily rate: 1/12
   - Daughter's daily rate: 1/x
   - Combined daily rate: 1/8
   - Equation: 1/12 + 1/x = 1/8
   - Solve for x

4. Look back and reflect:
   - Check if the solution makes sense
   - Consider if there are other ways to solve the problem
   - Discuss real-world factors that might affect the solution
