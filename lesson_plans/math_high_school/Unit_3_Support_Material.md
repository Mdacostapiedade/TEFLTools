Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Practical Applications and Problem-Solving in Timorese Mathematics, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Context**: The situation or environment in which a math problem is set
- **Application**: The use of mathematical concepts to solve real-world problems
- **Problem-solving**: The process of finding solutions to difficult or complex issues
- **Industry**: Economic activity concerned with the processing of raw materials and manufacture of goods
- **Variable**: A symbol representing a number we don't know yet, often used in algebra
- **Polya's method**: A four-step approach to problem-solving in mathematics
- **Fraction**: A part of a whole, represented as one number divided by another
- **Area**: The amount of space inside the boundary of a 2D shape

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Mind Map: "Mathematical Concepts in Timorese Industries"
   (A central bubble labeled "Timorese Industries" with branches to various industries like "Rice Farming", "Fishing", "Coffee Production". Each industry bubble has smaller bubbles around it with relevant math concepts such as "Area Calculation", "Percentages", "Volume Measurement", etc.)

2. Polya's Problem-Solving Method Flowchart
   (A flowchart with four main boxes connected by arrows:
   1. Understand the Problem
   2. Devise a Plan
   3. Carry Out the Plan
   4. Look Back and Reflect
   Each box contains bullet points with key questions or actions for that step.)

3. Visual Representation of the Sample Problem
   (A rectangle representing 1000 square meters of land, divided into four parts. Three parts (3/4) are shaded and labeled "Rice", while one part (1/4) is unshaded and labeled "Corn".)

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. "Real-World Math in Timorese Industries" Worksheet
   - Contains 5 scenario-based problems from different local industries
   - Each problem includes space for students to apply Polya's method
   - Example problem: "A coffee farmer harvests 500 kg of coffee cherries. If 20% of the harvest is lost during processing, how many kilograms of processed coffee will the farmer have?"

2. "Create Your Own Timorese Math Problem" Template
   - Provides a structure for students to create their own industry-based math problems
   - Includes sections for:
     * Choosing an industry
     * Identifying relevant math concepts
     * Writing the problem statement
     * Providing the solution using Polya's method

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Ethnomathematics in East Timor" by Kay Owens
2. "Teaching Mathematics in Multilingual Classrooms" by Mamokgethi Setati
3. Online resource: NRICH Mathematics (https://nrich.maths.org/) for problem-solving activities
4. Video series: "Math in the Real World" by Khan Academy
5. Local resource: "Traditional Measurement Systems in Timor-Leste" (a compilation of local measuring units and their conversions to metric system)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barriers:
   - Use visual aids and manipulatives to explain concepts
   - Encourage peer explanations in local languages
   - Develop a bilingual math vocabulary wall

2. Limited Resources:
   - Use locally available materials for hands-on activities
   - Encourage students to bring in real-world examples from home
   - Create a classroom "math kit" with basic tools that can be shared

3. Varying Skill Levels:
   - Implement differentiated instruction techniques
   - Use mixed-ability grouping for collaborative activities
   - Provide extension activities for advanced students

4. Cultural Relevance:
   - Regularly consult with local community members to ensure authenticity of contexts
   - Be sensitive to cultural norms when creating problem scenarios
   - Incorporate traditional problem-solving methods alongside formal mathematical approaches

5. Engagement with Abstract Concepts:
   - Start with concrete examples before moving to abstract representations
   - Use analogies and metaphors relevant to Timorese culture
   - Implement hands-on activities and simulations to make concepts tangible
