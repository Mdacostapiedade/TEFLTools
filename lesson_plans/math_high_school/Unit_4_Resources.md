## Place Value

### Introduction
- Place value is the value of a digit based on its position in a number
- Understanding place value is crucial for performing operations and understanding number relationships

### Key Concepts
1. Digit positions: ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.
2. Each place value is 10 times greater than the place to its right
3. Zero as a placeholder

### Examples
- 345: 3 hundreds, 4 tens, 5 ones
- 2,067: 2 thousands, 0 hundreds, 6 tens, 7 ones

### Demonstration
- Use base-10 blocks or local materials (stones, beans) to represent numbers
- Show how regrouping works when adding or subtracting

## Mental Math Strategies

### Addition Strategies
1. Making tens: 8 + 7 = (8 + 2) + 5 = 15
2. Compensation: 49 + 26 = (50 + 26) - 1 = 75

### Subtraction Strategies
1. Counting up: 83 - 79 = 4 (count up from 79 to 83)
2. Using addition: 52 - 25 = ? is the same as 25 + ? = 52

### Multiplication Strategies
1. Multiplying by 5: half the number, then multiply by 10
   Example: 18 x 5 = (18 ÷ 2) x 10 = 9 x 10 = 90
2. Multiplying by 9: multiply by 10 and subtract the original number
   Example: 7 x 9 = (7 x 10) - 7 = 70 - 7 = 63

## Estimation Techniques

### Rounding
- To nearest 10: look at ones digit, round up if 5 or more
- To nearest 100: look at tens digit, round up if 5 or more

### Front-End Estimation
- Focus on the most significant digits
- Example: 328 + 271 ≈ 300 + 200 = 500

### Clustering
- Group similar numbers and multiply
- Example: 22 + 19 + 23 + 21 ≈ 4 x 20 = 80

# Discussion Questions

1. How does understanding place value help in performing mental calculations?
2. What are some real-life situations where estimation skills would be useful in Timor-Leste?
3. How can we make learning about number operations more culturally relevant to Timorese students?
4. What challenges might students face when transitioning from concrete representations (like base-10 blocks) to abstract number concepts?
5. How can we encourage students to check the reasonableness of their answers?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflection on Number Sense

Write a 1-2 page reflection addressing the following points:
1. Describe a situation from your daily life where you use mental math or estimation.
2. Explain how understanding place value has helped you in your math studies or daily activities.
3. Discuss one mental math strategy you find particularly useful and why.
4. Propose an idea for teaching number sense to younger students using local materials or contexts.

# Assignment Details

## Create a Number Sense Resource

Develop a learning resource to help students understand and practice number sense concepts. Your resource should:

1. Focus on one specific aspect of number sense (e.g., place value, mental math, estimation)
2. Be suitable for secondary school students in Timor-Leste
3. Incorporate local contexts or materials
4. Include clear instructions and examples
5. Provide opportunities for student practice and self-assessment

Possible formats:
- A set of task cards with problems and solutions
- A game that reinforces number sense skills
- A visual aid explaining a mental math strategy
- A worksheet with real-world problems requiring estimation

Submit your resource along with a brief explanation of how it supports number sense development and how it could be used in a Timorese classroom.

## Mental Math Strategies Cheat Sheet

1. Adding 9: Add 10 and subtract 1
2. Multiplying by 11 (2-digit numbers): 
   - Write the sum of the digits between the original digits
   - Example: 45 x 11 = 495 (4 + 5 = 9)
3. Squaring numbers ending in 5:
   - Multiply the tens digit by the next whole number
   - Append 25 to the result
   - Example: 35² = (3 x 4)25 = 1225

## Estimation Word Problem Examples

1. A farmer harvests approximately 250 coconuts per tree. If there are 18 trees in the grove, about how many coconuts will be harvested in total?

2. The distance between two villages is 137 kilometers. If a bus travels at an average speed of 40 kilometers per hour, approximately how long will the journey take?

3. A local market sells rice for $0.75 per kilogram. If a family needs about 40 kilograms of rice for a month, estimate their monthly rice expense.
