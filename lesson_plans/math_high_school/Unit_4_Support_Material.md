# Support Material for Developing Number Sense and Operations

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Place value**: The value of a digit based on its position in a number
- **Mental math**: Performing calculations in one's head without writing them down
- **Estimation**: Making an educated guess about a quantity or calculation
- **Rounding**: Adjusting a number to the nearest ten, hundred, thousand, etc.
- **Reasonableness**: Determining if an answer makes sense in the context of a problem
- **Decomposing**: Breaking a number into smaller parts
- **Composing**: Combining smaller parts to form a larger number
- **Base-10 system**: A number system based on powers of 10
- **Digit**: A single symbol used to make numerals (0-9 in base-10)
- **Operation**: A mathematical process, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Place Value Chart:
```
Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones
    1     |    2     |  3   |  4
```

2. Number Line:
```
0---10---20---30---40---50---60---70---80---90---100
```

3. Mental Math Strategies Diagram:
```
Making Tens:
8 + 7 = (8 + 2) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15

Compensation:
49 + 23 = (50 + 23) - 1 = 73 - 1 = 72
```

4. Rounding Rules:
```
5 or more, raise the score
4 or less, let it rest
```

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Place Value Practice:
   - Write numbers in expanded form (e.g., 1,234 = 1,000 + 200 + 30 + 4)
   - Identify the value of underlined digits in various numbers
   - Compose numbers using given digits

2. Mental Math Challenge:
   - 10 questions for addition and subtraction (e.g., 45 + 29, 63 - 18)
   - 10 questions for multiplication (e.g., 7 x 8, 12 x 5)

3. Estimation Worksheet:
   - Round numbers to nearest 10, 100, 1000
   - Estimate sums, differences, products, and quotients
   - Real-world estimation problems (e.g., estimating grocery bill, distance traveled)

4. Word Problem Creation:
   - Template for creating word problems using local contexts
   - Space for students to write their own problems and solutions

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Online Resources:
   - Khan Academy: Place Value and Number Sense
   - IXL Math: Number Sense and Operations Practice
   - Math is Fun: Mental Math Techniques

2. Books:
   - "Number Talks: Helping Children Build Mental Math and Computation Strategies" by Sherry Parrish
   - "Elementary and Middle School Mathematics: Teaching Developmentally" by John A. Van de Walle

3. Apps:
   - Math Workout (for mental math practice)
   - Prodigy Math Game (for engaging math practice)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barriers:
   - Use visual aids and manipulatives to demonstrate concepts
   - Provide a bilingual math vocabulary list (Tetum-Portuguese)
   - Encourage students to explain concepts in their own words

2. Limited Resources:
   - Use locally available materials (stones, beans) as manipulatives
   - Create reusable resources (laminated number lines, place value charts)
   - Encourage mental math to reduce reliance on calculators

3. Mixed Ability Levels:
   - Implement differentiated instruction with tiered activities
   - Use peer tutoring to support struggling students
   - Provide extension activities for advanced learners

4. Misconceptions about Place Value:
   - Use concrete representations before moving to abstract concepts
   - Emphasize the relationship between digit position and value
   - Practice decomposing and composing numbers regularly

5. Difficulty with Mental Math:
   - Start with simpler problems and gradually increase difficulty
   - Teach and practice specific strategies regularly
   - Encourage students to share their mental math processes

6. Lack of Real-World Connections:
   - Use local contexts in word problems (e.g., market prices, crop yields)
   - Invite local professionals to discuss how they use math in their work
   - Assign projects that require math application in daily life situations
