## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Limited Resources**
   - Challenge: Lack of materials for game creation
   - Solution: Use locally available materials (stones, sticks, bottle caps) as game pieces

2. **Language Barriers**
   - Challenge: Students struggling with math vocabulary
   - Solution: Create bilingual math word walls and encourage peer translation

3. **Cultural Sensitivity**
   - Challenge: Ensuring games are culturally appropriate
   - Solution: Consult with local elders or community leaders about game content

4. **Mixed Ability Levels**
   - Challenge: Games too easy/difficult for some students
   - Solution: Design games with multiple levels of difficulty or adaptable rules

5. **Technology Limitations**
   - Challenge: Limited or no access to computers/internet
   - Solution: Focus on offline games and provide printed versions of online resources

6. **Time Management**
   - Challenge: Games taking longer than expected
   - Solution: Set clear time limits and have a quick backup activity ready

7. **Student Engagement**
   - Challenge: Some students not participating fully
   - Solution: Rotate roles within games and use peer teaching to involve all students

8. **Assessment Concerns**
   - Challenge: Difficulty in assessing learning through games
   - Solution: Use observation checklists and follow-up questions to evaluate understanding
