# Lesson Plan: Cultural and Language Considerations in Math Education

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with examples of traditional Timorese patterns
- Bilingual dictionaries (Tetum-Portuguese)
- Colored paper and scissors
- Computers with internet access (if available)
- Sample math textbooks in Tetum and Portuguese

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify key mathematical vocabulary in both Tetum and Portuguese
- Explain the importance of bilingual instruction in mathematics
- Recognize mathematical concepts in traditional Timorese patterns
- Create a simple bilingual math glossary
- Design a math activity that incorporates elements of Timorese culture

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display a traditional Timorese tais pattern on the board
- Ask students to identify any mathematical concepts they can see in the pattern (e.g., symmetry, geometric shapes, repetition)
- Discuss responses as a class, introducing relevant vocabulary in both Tetum and Portuguese

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce the following terms in both Tetum and Portuguese:
  - Symmetry / Simetria
  - Pattern / Padrão
  - Geometry / Geometria
  - Translation / Translação
  - Rotation / Rotação
- Have students repeat the words and practice using them in sentences

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (25 minutes)

- Explain the concept of ethnomathematics and its relevance to Timorese education
- Discuss the importance of bilingual instruction in mathematics:
  - Facilitates understanding for students more comfortable in Tetum
  - Prepares students for higher education where Portuguese may be used
  - Preserves cultural identity while advancing mathematical knowledge
- Demonstrate how to analyze a traditional pattern for mathematical concepts:
  - Identify shapes, symmetry, and transformations
  - Discuss how these concepts can be taught using cultural examples

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Distribute handouts with different Timorese patterns
- Have each group:
  1. Identify mathematical concepts present in their pattern
  2. List relevant vocabulary in both Tetum and Portuguese
  3. Explain how they would use the pattern to teach a specific math concept

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

Task 1: Creating Bilingual Math Glossaries (20 minutes)
- Students work in pairs to create a bilingual math glossary
- Focus on 10-15 key terms related to geometry and patterns
- Encourage students to include visual representations where appropriate

Task 2: Designing Culturally Relevant Math Activities (20 minutes)
- Students individually design a short math activity that incorporates Timorese cultural elements
- The activity should target a specific mathematical concept and include instructions in both Tetum and Portuguese

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Have 2-3 students share their culturally relevant math activities
- Discuss as a class how these activities support both mathematical understanding and cultural appreciation
- Review key vocabulary in both languages

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Complete the bilingual math glossary, adding 5 more terms
- Refine the culturally relevant math activity and prepare to teach it to the class in the next session
- Research one traditional Timorese craft or art form and identify at least three mathematical concepts it incorporates

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Ethnomathematics: The study of the relationship between mathematics and culture
- Bilingual instruction: Teaching that uses two languages to deliver content and instruction
- Tais: Traditional Timorese woven cloth with intricate patterns
- Symmetry: A precise and mathematically well-defined concept of patterned self-similarity
- Translation: A geometric transformation that moves every point of a figure the same distance in the same direction
- Rotation: A geometric transformation that turns a figure about a fixed point
- Geometric shape: A shape with defined dimensions and properties, such as triangles, circles, and rectangles
