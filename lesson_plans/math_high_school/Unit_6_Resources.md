# Lecture Notes

## Ethnomathematics and Its Relevance to Timorese Education

### What is Ethnomathematics?
- Defined as the study of mathematical ideas and practices in different cultural contexts
- Coined by Brazilian mathematician Ubiratan D'Ambrosio in the 1970s
- Recognizes that mathematics is a cultural product and varies across societies

### Relevance to Timorese Education
- Validates traditional knowledge and practices
- Bridges the gap between home and school mathematics
- Enhances cultural pride and identity
- Improves engagement and understanding of mathematical concepts

### Examples in Timorese Context
- Tais weaving: Incorporates geometry, symmetry, and pattern recognition
- Traditional architecture: Uses spatial reasoning and measurement
- Agricultural practices: Involves estimation, counting, and basic arithmetic

## Bilingual Instruction in Mathematics

### Importance of Bilingual Approach
- Addresses the linguistic diversity in Timor-Leste (Tetum, Portuguese, local languages)
- Facilitates comprehension for students more comfortable in Tetum
- Prepares students for higher education where Portuguese is often used
- Preserves cultural identity while advancing mathematical knowledge

### Strategies for Bilingual Math Instruction
- Use of cognates between Tetum and Portuguese
- Visual aids with labels in both languages
- Code-switching techniques during instruction
- Development of bilingual math glossaries

### Challenges and Solutions
- Limited math resources in Tetum
- Varying proficiency levels in Portuguese
- Need for teacher training in bilingual instruction

## Analyzing Traditional Patterns for Mathematical Concepts

### Steps for Analysis
1. Identify basic shapes and elements
2. Look for symmetry (reflection, rotation, translation)
3. Observe repetition and patterns
4. Recognize proportions and scaling
5. Identify geometric transformations

### Mathematical Concepts in Tais Patterns
- Geometry: Triangles, rectangles, rhombuses
- Symmetry: Bilateral and rotational
- Transformations: Translation, reflection, rotation
- Algebra: Linear patterns, sequences
- Measurement: Proportions, scaling

### Using Patterns in Math Instruction
- Introduce geometric concepts through pattern analysis
- Teach transformations by manipulating pattern elements
- Develop algebraic thinking through pattern extension
- Practice measurement skills by recreating patterns

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Exercise 1: Bilingual Math Concept Explanation

Write a short paragraph (100-150 words) explaining a mathematical concept of your choice in both Tetum and Portuguese. Ensure that the explanation is clear, concise, and uses appropriate mathematical vocabulary in both languages. Consider how you would present this explanation to secondary school students in Timor-Leste.

## Exercise 2: Cultural Math Activity Design

Design a math activity (200-250 words) that incorporates a traditional Timorese cultural element. Your activity should:
- Target a specific mathematical concept suitable for secondary school level
- Include clear instructions in both Tetum and Portuguese
- Explain how the activity connects to Timorese culture
- Describe the materials needed and the step-by-step process
- Include at least one discussion question to promote critical thinking

# Assignment Details

## Assignment 1: Bilingual Math Glossary

Create a comprehensive bilingual math glossary containing at least 30 mathematical terms relevant to secondary school mathematics. For each term, provide:
- The term in Tetum
- The term in Portuguese
- A clear definition in both languages
- An example or visual representation where appropriate

Submit the glossary in a table format, either as a digital document or a handwritten booklet.

## Assignment 2: Cultural Pattern Analysis and Lesson Plan

1. Select a traditional Timorese pattern (e.g., from tais, architecture, or crafts).
2. Analyze the pattern for mathematical concepts, identifying at least five different concepts.
3. Create a detailed lesson plan (500-750 words) for teaching one of these concepts using the pattern. The lesson plan should include:
   - Lesson objectives
   - Materials needed
   - Step-by-step instructional activities
   - Assessment methods
   - Bilingual instructions and explanations (Tetum and Portuguese)
   - Adaptations for different learning levels

Submit both the analysis and the lesson plan as a single document.

# Additional Materials and Examples

## Sample Tais Pattern Analysis

Mathematical concepts identified:
1. Symmetry: Bilateral symmetry along vertical axis
2. Geometric shapes: Rhombuses, triangles, and rectangles
3. Transformations: Translation of smaller motifs
4. Proportion: Consistent sizing of repeated elements
5. Sequences: Alternating color patterns

## Bilingual Math Vocabulary Flashcards

Create a set of flashcards for common geometric terms:

1. Circle / Círculo / Sírkulu
2. Square / Quadrado / Kuadradu
3. Triangle / Triângulo / Triángulu
4. Rectangle / Retângulo / Retángulu

[Include visual representations for each term]

## Cultural Math Problem Example

In Tetum:
Juana halo tais ida ho naruk metru 2 no luan sentímetru 80. Nia hakarak fahe tais ne'e ba peça ki'ik ho medida 40 cm x 20 cm. Peça hira mak Juana bele hetan husi tais ida ne'e?

In Portuguese:
Juana fez um tais com 2 metros de comprimento e 80 centímetros de largura. Ela quer dividir este tais em peças menores com medidas de 40 cm x 20 cm. Quantas peças Juana pode obter deste tais?

[Include a visual representation of the problem]
