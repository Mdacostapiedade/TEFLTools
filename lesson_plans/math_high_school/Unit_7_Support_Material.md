Here are the support materials for the lesson on Assessment and Evaluation Techniques in Mathematics:

# Support Materials

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Formative assessment**: Ongoing evaluation during the learning process to provide feedback and improve teaching and learning
- **Summative assessment**: Evaluation at the end of a learning unit to measure student achievement
- **Rubric**: A scoring guide that lists criteria for evaluating work and describes levels of quality
- **Criteria**: Specific elements or characteristics used to judge performance
- **Performance levels**: Descriptions of varying degrees of quality or achievement in a rubric
- **Culturally responsive assessment**: Assessment practices that consider and respect students' cultural backgrounds and experiences
- **Misconception**: An incorrect idea or understanding of a concept
- **Feedback**: Information provided about a student's performance to improve learning

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Rubric Creation Worksheet:
   - Title: Creating a Math Project Rubric
   - Sections:
     a. Project description (geometric shapes in traditional Timorese architecture)
     b. Criteria brainstorming (e.g., accuracy, creativity, cultural relevance)
     c. Performance level descriptions (3-4 levels for each criterion)
     d. Rubric template to fill in

2. Student Work Analysis Guide:
   - Steps for analyzing student work:
     1. Identify correct elements
     2. Spot errors or misconceptions
     3. Determine patterns across multiple samples
     4. Reflect on implications for instruction
   - Questions to consider during analysis
   - Space for notes and observations

   - Video demonstrations of effective feedback techniques in math classrooms

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students unfamiliar with rubrics
   - Tip: Introduce rubrics gradually, involve students in creating simple rubrics

2. Challenge: Limited resources for diverse assessments
   - Tip: Use locally available materials, focus on oral assessments and observations

3. Challenge: Balancing cultural relevance with curriculum requirements
   - Tip: Adapt standard problems to local contexts, use familiar scenarios in word problems

4. Challenge: Language barriers in assessment
   - Tip: Use visual aids, allow explanations in local languages, provide bilingual glossaries

5. Challenge: Resistance to new assessment methods
   - Tip: Explain benefits to students and parents, gradually introduce new techniques alongside traditional ones

6. Challenge: Time constraints for individual feedback
   - Tip: Use peer assessment, small group feedback sessions, and written comments on select assignments
