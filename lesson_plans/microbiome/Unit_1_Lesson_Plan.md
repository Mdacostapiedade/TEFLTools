# Lesson Plan: Introduction to the Brain-Gut-Microbiota Axis

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts with diagram of the brain-gut-microbiota axis
- Sticky notes
- Flip chart paper

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define the brain-gut-microbiota axis and its components
- Explain the bidirectional communication between the brain and gut
- Identify key players in the brain-gut-microbiota axis
- Relate traditional Timorese beliefs to modern understanding of diet and mental health

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to write on sticky notes any traditional Timorese sayings or beliefs about the connection between food and mood or mental state
- Have students share their notes and create a word cloud on the whiteboard

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Brain-gut-microbiota axis
- Bidirectional communication
- Microbiota
- Neurotransmitters
- Vagus nerve

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of the brain-gut-microbiota axis
  * Definition and importance
  * Historical context and recent scientific developments
- Key players in the axis:
  * Brain: structure and function related to the axis
  * Gut: anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal tract
  * Microbiota: types of microorganisms and their roles
- Bidirectional communication pathways:
  * Neural pathways (e.g., vagus nerve)
  * Endocrine pathways
  * Immune system interactions
  * Microbial metabolites

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- Small group discussion: Compare and contrast traditional Timorese beliefs about diet and mental health with modern scientific understanding
- Pair work: Students explain the brain-gut-microbiota axis to each other using the provided diagram

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

- In groups of 3-4, students create a detailed diagram illustrating the brain-gut-microbiota axis, including:
  * Key players
  * Communication pathways
  * Examples of how diet might influence the axis
- Groups present their diagrams to the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Class discussion: How might understanding the brain-gut-microbiota axis impact health practices in Timor-Leste?
- Quick quiz: Students answer 5 multiple-choice questions about the lesson content

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research a traditional Timorese food and write a 1-page report on its potential effects on the brain-gut-microbiota axis, citing at least two scientific sources

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Brain-gut-microbiota axis: The bidirectional communication system between the central nervous system, the gastrointestinal tract, and the microorganisms living in the gut
- Bidirectional communication: Two-way interaction between different parts of a system
- Microbiota: The community of microorganisms living in a specific environment, such as the gut
- Neurotransmitters: Chemical messengers that transmit signals between nerve cells
- Vagus nerve: The longest cranial nerve, connecting the brain to various organs including the gut, playing a crucial role in the brain-gut-microbiota axis
