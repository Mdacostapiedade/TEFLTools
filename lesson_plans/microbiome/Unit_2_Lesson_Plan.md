# Lesson Plan: Nutrition and Mental Health in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Textbook: "The Gut-Brain Axis: Dietary, Probiotic, and Prebiotic Interventions on the Microbiota"
- "Timor-Leste Food and Nutrition Survey" report
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts on key nutrients for brain health
- Local Timorese food items or pictures
- Nutritional analysis software or apps

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the basic principles of nutritional neuroscience
- Identify key nutrients essential for brain health
- Analyze typical Timorese dietary patterns and their potential impact on mental health
- Design a brain-healthy meal using local Timorese ingredients

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display various pictures of Timorese dishes on the projector
- Ask students to identify the dishes and list the main ingredients
- Discuss: "How do you think these foods might affect our brain and mental health?"

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Nutritional neuroscience
- Neurotransmitters
- Omega-3 fatty acids
- Antioxidants
- Micronutrients
- Macronutrients

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

a. Introduction to nutritional neuroscience
   - Definition and scope
   - How nutrition affects brain function and mental health

b. Key nutrients for brain health
   - Omega-3 fatty acids
   - B vitamins
   - Antioxidants
   - Minerals (e.g., zinc, magnesium, iron)
   - Protein

c. Overview of Timorese dietary patterns
   - Traditional foods and their nutritional value
   - Common nutritional deficiencies in Timor-Leste
   - Potential impact on mental health

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

a. Nutrient identification exercise (15 minutes)
   - Provide students with a list of common Timorese foods
   - In small groups, have students identify the key brain-healthy nutrients in each food

b. Nutritional analysis of a typical Timorese meal (15 minutes)
   - Present a common Timorese meal
   - Using nutritional analysis software or apps, guide students in analyzing its nutritional content
   - Discuss potential deficiencies or excesses in relation to brain health

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

a. Design a brain-healthy meal (25 minutes)
   - In pairs, students create a meal plan using local Timorese ingredients
   - Emphasize incorporating key nutrients for brain health
   - Consider cultural acceptability and accessibility of ingredients

b. Presentation and feedback (15 minutes)
   - Each pair presents their meal plan to the class
   - Classmates and instructor provide feedback on nutritional adequacy and cultural appropriateness

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points of nutritional neuroscience and its relevance to Timorese diet
- Discuss challenges and opportunities for improving nutrition for mental health in Timor-Leste
- Address any remaining questions from students

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research one traditional Timorese food and its potential impact on brain health
- Write a 500-word report including:
  1. Nutritional composition of the food
  2. Its potential benefits or drawbacks for mental health
  3. Suggestions for incorporating or modifying it to enhance brain health

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Nutritional neuroscience: The study of how nutrients affect brain function and mental health
- Neurotransmitters: Chemical messengers in the brain that transmit signals between neurons
- Omega-3 fatty acids: Essential fats crucial for brain function and development
- Antioxidants: Compounds that protect cells from damage caused by free radicals
- Micronutrients: Essential nutrients needed in small amounts, such as vitamins and minerals
- Macronutrients: Nutrients needed in larger amounts, including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats
