# Support Material for Nutrition and Mental Health in Timor-Leste Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Nutritional neuroscience: The study of how nutrients affect brain function and mental health
- Neurotransmitters: Chemical messengers in the brain that transmit signals between neurons
- Omega-3 fatty acids: Essential fats crucial for brain function and development
- Antioxidants: Compounds that protect cells from damage caused by free radicals
- Micronutrients: Essential nutrients needed in small amounts, such as vitamins and minerals
- Macronutrients: Nutrients needed in larger amounts, including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats
- Gut-brain axis: The bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain
- Probiotics: Live microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit
- Prebiotics: Non-digestible food components that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria
- Neuroplasticity: The brain's ability to form and reorganize synaptic connections, especially in response to learning or experience

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Brain-Gut-Microbiota Axis Diagram:
   - A simple illustration showing the brain connected to the gut via the vagus nerve
   - Depict the gut with various microbiota represented
   - Include arrows indicating bidirectional communication

2. Nutrient-Rich Timorese Foods Chart:
   - Create a chart with images of common Timorese foods
   - List key brain-healthy nutrients found in each food
   - Include brief descriptions of how each nutrient benefits brain health

3. Mental Health and Nutrition Infographic:
   - Visual representation of how different nutrients affect mood and cognitive function
   - Use icons to represent various mental health states (e.g., happy face, sad face)
   - Connect these to food icons representing nutrient sources

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Nutrient Identification Worksheet:
   - List of 10-15 common Timorese foods
   - Columns for students to identify key nutrients and their brain health benefits
   - Space for students to suggest ways to incorporate these foods into daily meals

2. Brain-Healthy Meal Planning Guide:
   - Template for creating a balanced, brain-healthy meal
   - Sections for protein sources, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and fruits/vegetables
   - Checklist of essential brain nutrients to include in the meal

3. Nutritional Analysis Activity Sheet:
   - Provide nutritional information for a typical Timorese meal
   - Guide students through analyzing its nutritional content
   - Questions prompting students to identify potential deficiencies or excesses in relation to brain health

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Scientific Articles:
   - "The Gut-Brain Axis: Interactions Between Enteric Microbiota, Central and Enteric Nervous Systems" by Marilia Carabotti et al.
   - "Nutritional psychiatry: Your brain on food" by Eva Selhub, Harvard Health Blog

2. Books:
   - "The Psychobiotic Revolution" by Scott C. Anderson
   - "This Is Your Brain on Food" by Uma Naidoo

3. Online Resources:
   - World Health Organization's page on Nutrition in Timor-Leste
   - The Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Nutrition

4. Local Resources:
   - Timor-Leste National Nutrition Strategy reports
   - Local NGO publications on food security and nutrition in Timor-Leste

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Limited access to diverse foods:
   - Focus on locally available, nutrient-rich alternatives
   - Discuss food preservation techniques to extend availability of seasonal produce

2. Cultural beliefs about food and mental health:
   - Approach the topic sensitively, acknowledging traditional beliefs
   - Use local examples and success stories to illustrate the connection between nutrition and mental health

3. Language barriers:
   - Prepare key terms in both English and Tetum
   - Use visual aids to support explanations

4. Limited nutritional analysis resources:
   - Prepare simplified nutritional information sheets for common local foods
   - Teach basic calculation methods for estimating nutritional content

5. Resistance to changing dietary habits:
   - Emphasize small, gradual changes rather than complete diet overhauls
   - Highlight the cultural significance of traditional, nutrient-rich foods

6. Addressing misconceptions about mental health:
   - Provide clear, scientific explanations of the brain-gut connection
   - Invite local health professionals or community leaders to discuss the importance of mental health

By addressing these challenges proactively, teachers can ensure a more effective and culturally sensitive learning experience for students in Timor-Leste.
