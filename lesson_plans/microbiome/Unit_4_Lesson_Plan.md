# Lesson Plan: Ultra-processed Foods and Gut Microbiota in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts with examples of ultra-processed foods
- Smartphones or tablets for online survey creation
- Poster paper and markers for group activities
- Sample ultra-processed food packages from Timor-Leste

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define ultra-processed foods and provide examples relevant to Timor-Leste
- Explain the impact of ultra-processed foods on gut microbiota
- Analyze ultra-processed food consumption trends in Timor-Leste
- Design and conduct a survey on ultra-processed food consumption
- Create educational materials about the risks of ultra-processed foods

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display various food packages (both ultra-processed and minimally processed) from Timor-Leste
- Ask students to categorize them into two groups based on their perception of which are healthier
- Discuss their choices and introduce the concept of ultra-processed foods

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Ultra-processed foods
- Food additives
- Gut microbiota
- Dysbiosis
- Nutrient density

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Definition and characteristics of ultra-processed foods
- Examples of ultra-processed foods common in Timor-Leste
- Impact of ultra-processed foods on gut microbiota
- Overview of ultra-processed food consumption trends in Timor-Leste
- Potential health consequences of high ultra-processed food consumption

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Group activity: Analyze nutrition labels from ultra-processed foods found in Timor-Leste
- Identify additives, added sugars, and other characteristics of ultra-processed foods
- Compare nutrient density of ultra-processed foods with minimally processed alternatives

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Divide the class into small groups
- Each group designs a brief survey to assess ultra-processed food consumption in their local community
- Groups create educational materials (e.g., posters, infographics) on the risks of ultra-processed foods for Timorese audiences

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Groups present their surveys and educational materials
- Class discussion on strategies to reduce ultra-processed food consumption in Timor-Leste
- Recap key points about ultra-processed foods and their impact on gut microbiota

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Conduct the designed survey with at least 10 people in their local community
- Research traditional Timorese foods that could serve as healthier alternatives to ultra-processed options
- Write a short reflection on personal ultra-processed food consumption and potential areas for improvement

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Ultra-processed foods: Formulations of ingredients, mostly of exclusive industrial use, resulting from a series of industrial processes.
- Food additives: Substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance taste, appearance, or other qualities.
- Gut microbiota: The community of microorganisms living in the digestive tracts of humans and animals.
- Dysbiosis: An imbalance in the gut microbial community associated with disease states.
- Nutrient density: The ratio of nutrients to calories in a food item.
