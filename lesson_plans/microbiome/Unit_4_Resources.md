## Definition and Examples of Ultra-processed Foods

### What are ultra-processed foods?
- Foods that have undergone multiple industrial processes
- Often contain additives, preservatives, and artificial ingredients
- Typically high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, and salt
- Low in fiber, vitamins, and minerals

### Examples of ultra-processed foods in Timor-Leste:
1. Instant noodles
2. Carbonated soft drinks
3. Packaged snacks (chips, cookies)
4. Processed meats (canned meat, sausages)
5. Sweetened breakfast cereals
6. Flavored milk drinks
7. Instant coffee mixes

### NOVA classification system:
1. Unprocessed or minimally processed foods
2. Processed culinary ingredients
3. Processed foods
4. Ultra-processed foods

## Impact of Ultra-processed Foods on Gut Microbiota

### Gut microbiota basics:
- Trillions of microorganisms living in the digestive tract
- Play crucial roles in digestion, immunity, and overall health

### Effects of ultra-processed foods on gut microbiota:
1. Reduced microbial diversity
2. Increased harmful bacteria
3. Decreased beneficial bacteria
4. Disruption of gut barrier function
5. Increased inflammation

### Mechanisms of disruption:
- High sugar content feeding harmful bacteria
- Lack of fiber reducing beneficial bacteria
- Artificial additives altering microbial composition
- Emulsifiers damaging the gut lining

## Ultra-processed Food Consumption Trends in Timor-Leste

### Current situation:
- Limited data available on ultra-processed food consumption in Timor-Leste
- Increasing urbanization and modernization leading to dietary shifts
- Growing availability of imported ultra-processed foods

### Factors contributing to increased consumption:
1. Convenience and time-saving appeal
2. Aggressive marketing strategies
3. Changing taste preferences
4. Perceived modernity and status
5. Lack of nutrition education

### Potential consequences:
- Rising rates of obesity and non-communicable diseases
- Micronutrient deficiencies
- Disruption of traditional dietary patterns
- Economic impact on local food systems
