Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Ultra-processed Foods and Gut Microbiota in Timor-Leste, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Lesson Plan

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Ultra-processed foods: Formulations of ingredients, mostly of exclusive industrial use, resulting from a series of industrial processes.
- Food additives: Substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance taste, appearance, or other qualities.
- Gut microbiota: The community of microorganisms living in the digestive tracts of humans and animals.
- Dysbiosis: An imbalance in the gut microbial community associated with disease states.
- Nutrient density: The ratio of nutrients to calories in a food item.
- Emulsifiers: Additives used to mix ingredients that normally don't combine, like oil and water.
- Preservatives: Substances added to foods to prevent spoilage, discoloration, or contamination.
- Artificial sweeteners: Non-nutritive substances used to sweeten foods and beverages.
- Refined carbohydrates: Grains that have been processed to remove the bran and germ, leaving only the endosperm.
- Probiotics: Live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Ultra-processed Food Spectrum:
   A diagram showing a continuum from minimally processed to ultra-processed foods, with examples from Timor-Leste at each stage.

2. Gut Microbiota Composition:
   A pie chart illustrating the major bacterial phyla found in a healthy gut microbiome.

3. Impact of Ultra-processed Foods on Gut Microbiota:
   An infographic showing how ultra-processed foods can lead to dysbiosis, inflammation, and potential health consequences.

4. Nutrient Density Comparison:
   A bar graph comparing the nutrient density of traditional Timorese foods with ultra-processed alternatives.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

2. Nutrition Label Analysis Guide:
   - Step-by-step instructions for reading nutrition labels
   - Tips for identifying ultra-processed foods based on ingredient lists
   - Practice section with sample nutrition labels from Timorese products

3. Survey Design Template:
   - Outline for creating a brief survey on ultra-processed food consumption
   - Sample questions and response formats
   - Tips for conducting surveys in the local community

4. Healthy Alternatives Checklist:
   - List of common ultra-processed foods in Timor-Leste
   - Space for students to suggest healthier, minimally processed alternatives
   - Nutritional comparison section for each pair of foods

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Scientific Articles:
   - "Ultra-processed foods and health outcomes: A narrative review" (Nutrients, 2020)
   - "The impact of ultra-processed foods on gut microbiota and health" (Current Opinion in Food Science, 2021)

2. Websites:
   - World Health Organization (WHO) page on healthy diet
   - NOVA Food Classification System explanation

3. Books:
   - "The Gut-Brain Axis: Dietary, Probiotic, and Prebiotic Interventions on the Microbiota" by Niall Hyland and Catherine Stanton
   - "Ultra-Processed People: The Science Behind Food That Isn't Food" by Chris van Tulleken

4. Local Resources:
   - Timor-Leste Ministry of Health nutrition guidelines
   - Reports from local NGOs on food consumption patterns in Timor-Leste

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Limited access to ultra-processed foods in rural areas:
   - Focus on products available in local markets and small shops
   - Discuss the increasing availability of these foods and potential future impacts

2. Language barriers with nutrition labels:
   - Provide translations of common terms found on imported food packages
   - Create a glossary of food additive names in local languages

3. Cultural sensitivity around traditional foods:
   - Emphasize the nutritional value of traditional Timorese cuisine
   - Frame the discussion as preserving cultural food practices in the face of globalization

4. Limited internet access for online surveys:
   - Prepare paper-based survey alternatives
   - Discuss other methods of data collection, such as in-person interviews

5. Difficulty understanding scientific concepts:
   - Use local analogies and examples to explain complex ideas
   - Incorporate hands-on activities and visual aids to reinforce learning

6. Resistance to changing dietary habits:
   - Focus on small, achievable changes rather than complete diet overhauls
   - Discuss the long-term benefits of reducing ultra-processed food consumption

7. Limited resources for creating educational materials:
   - Encourage use of locally available materials for posters and presentations
   - Teach simple graphic design techniques using free online tools
