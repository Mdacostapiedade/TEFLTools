# Lesson Plan: Developmental Origins of the Brain-Gut-Microbiota System

## 1. Resources Needed

- Textbook: "The Gut-Brain Axis: Dietary, Probiotic, and Prebiotic Interventions on the Microbiota"
- "Timor-Leste Food and Nutrition Survey" report
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on prenatal nutrition guidelines
- Case study materials on maternal and infant nutrition in Timor-Leste

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the prenatal influences on the brain-gut-microbiota axis
- Describe the importance of early-life nutrition in microbiota development
- Analyze breastfeeding practices in Timor-Leste and their impact on gut microbiota
- Develop recommendations for improving early-life nutrition in Timorese communities

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Students reflect on their own early-life nutrition experiences or those of their family members. They share with a partner and then discuss as a class how these experiences might have influenced their health.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Microbiota
- Colonization
- Prenatal nutrition
- Postnatal nutrition
- Exclusive breastfeeding
- Complementary feeding

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Lecture on prenatal influences on the brain-gut-microbiota axis
- Discussion of early-life nutrition and its role in microbiota development
- Presentation on breastfeeding practices in Timor-Leste, using data from the "Timor-Leste Food and Nutrition Survey" report

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- Small group activity: Students analyze nutritional guidelines for pregnant women in Timor-Leste and compare them to international standards.
- Class discussion on the challenges and opportunities for improving prenatal nutrition in Timorese communities.

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

- Case study analysis: In groups, students examine a case study on maternal and infant nutrition in a rural Timorese community. They identify key issues and propose solutions.
- Groups present their findings and recommendations to the class.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students answer multiple-choice questions on key concepts covered in the lesson.
- Class discussion on the most important takeaways from the lesson.

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students will research and write a 2-page report on a traditional Timorese practice related to maternal or infant nutrition. They should analyze its potential impact on the brain-gut-microbiota axis and suggest ways to integrate beneficial practices into modern healthcare recommendations.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Microbiota: The community of microorganisms living in a specific environment, such as the gut.
- Colonization: The process by which microorganisms establish themselves in a new environment, like an infant's gut.
- Prenatal nutrition: The dietary intake and nutritional status of a woman during pregnancy.
- Postnatal nutrition: The dietary intake and nutritional status of an infant after birth.
- Exclusive breastfeeding: Feeding an infant only breast milk for the first six months of life.
- Complementary feeding: The process of introducing solid foods to an infant's diet while continuing breastfeeding.
