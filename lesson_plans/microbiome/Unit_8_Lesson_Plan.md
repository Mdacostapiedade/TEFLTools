# Lesson Plan: Epigenetics, Nutritional Programming, and Lifestyle Psychiatry in Timor-Leste

## Resources Needed

- Textbook: "The Gut-Brain Axis: Dietary, Probiotic, and Prebiotic Interventions on the Microbiota"
- Selected articles from "Nutritional Neuroscience" journal
- "Timor-Leste Food and Nutrition Survey" report
- Computers with internet access for research
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on epigenetics and nutritional programming basics
- Local food samples or images representing traditional Timorese cuisine

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Define epigenetics and explain its role in mental health
2. Describe the concept of nutritional programming across the lifespan
3. Apply principles of lifestyle psychiatry to the Timorese context
4. Develop culturally appropriate strategies for promoting mental health through nutrition and lifestyle changes

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

1. Display images of various Timorese foods on the screen.
2. Ask students to work in pairs and discuss:
   - How might these foods impact mental health?
   - Are there any traditional beliefs in Timor-Leste about the connection between these foods and well-being?
3. Share responses with the class, noting common themes.

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Write the following terms on the whiteboard and briefly explain each:
- Epigenetics
- DNA methylation
- Histone modification
- Nutritional programming
- Lifestyle psychiatry
- Bioactive compounds

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduction to Epigenetics (10 minutes)
   - Definition and basic mechanisms (DNA methylation, histone modification)
   - How epigenetic changes can affect gene expression
   - Examples of environmental factors influencing epigenetics

2. Nutritional Programming Across the Lifespan (10 minutes)
   - Concept of critical periods in development
   - How early nutrition can impact long-term health outcomes
   - Examples relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., effects of malnutrition during pregnancy)

3. Lifestyle Psychiatry in Timor-Leste (10 minutes)
   - Overview of lifestyle psychiatry principles
   - Adapting lifestyle interventions to the Timorese context
   - Potential challenges and opportunities in implementing lifestyle psychiatry approaches

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Epigenetics Case Study Analysis (15 minutes)
   - Divide students into small groups
   - Provide each group with a case study describing an individual's lifestyle and environmental exposures
   - Ask groups to identify potential epigenetic influences and discuss how these might impact mental health

2. Nutritional Programming Timeline (15 minutes)
   - Students create a timeline of critical periods in human development
   - For each period, they identify key nutrients and environmental factors that may influence long-term mental health outcomes
   - Discuss how these factors apply to the Timorese population

## Production Tasks (40 minutes)

1. Develop a Public Health Campaign (20 minutes)
   - In groups, students create a brief outline for a public health campaign promoting lifestyle changes for better mental health in Timor-Leste
   - Campaigns should incorporate principles of epigenetics and nutritional programming
   - Groups present their ideas to the class

2. Personalized Nutrition and Lifestyle Plan (20 minutes)
   - Individually, students create a personalized nutrition and lifestyle plan for a hypothetical Timorese patient with a mental health disorder
   - Plans should consider local food availability, cultural practices, and potential epigenetic influences

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

1. Recap key points from the lesson
2. Facilitate a brief discussion on how understanding epigenetics and nutritional programming can improve mental health interventions in Timor-Leste
3. Address any remaining questions from students

## Homework Assignment

1. Research Assignment:
   - Investigate a traditional Timorese food or practice
   - Analyze its potential impact on epigenetics and mental health
   - Write a 500-word report summarizing findings and suggesting how this knowledge could be incorporated into lifestyle psychiatry approaches

2. Reflection:
   - Write a brief reflection (250 words) on how the concepts learned in this lesson might influence your future practice as a healthcare professional in Timor-Leste

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

1. Epigenetics: The study of heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence.

2. DNA methylation: The addition of methyl groups to DNA molecules, which can modify gene expression without changing the DNA sequence.

3. Histone modification: Changes to histone proteins that can affect how tightly DNA is wrapped around them, influencing gene expression.

4. Nutritional programming: The concept that nutrition during critical periods of development can have long-lasting effects on health and disease risk.

5. Lifestyle psychiatry: An approach to mental health that emphasizes the role of lifestyle factors, including diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management, in preventing and treating mental health disorders.

6. Bioactive compounds: Chemicals found in foods that have an effect on living tissue and can influence health outcomes.
