## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barrier:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle with English terms.
   - Solution: Provide all key concepts in both English and Tetum. Use local metaphors and examples to explain abstract ideas.

2. Cultural Sensitivity:
   - Challenge: Some concepts may seem at odds with traditional beliefs.
   - Solution: Always relate new ideas to local traditions. Invite discussion on how grace concepts align with or differ from Timorese spirituality.

3. Trauma Responses:
   - Challenge: Ego relaxation practices may trigger trauma responses in some students.
   - Solution: Be prepared with grounding techniques. Have local mental health resources available. Emphasize that participation is voluntary.

4. Resistance to Meditation:
   - Challenge: Some students may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with meditation practices.
   - Solution: Start with short, guided sessions. Offer alternatives like walking meditation or contemplative art activities.

5. Abstract Concepts:
   - Challenge: Students may find it difficult to grasp abstract spiritual concepts.
   - Solution: Use concrete examples from daily Timorese life. Encourage students to share personal experiences that relate to the concepts.

6. Limited Resources:
   - Challenge: Lack of materials or proper space for activities.
   - Solution: Be creative with local resources. Use natural settings for meditation when possible. Encourage students to create their own visual aids using available materials.
