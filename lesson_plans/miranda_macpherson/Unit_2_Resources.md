## Timorese Folktale: The Surrender of the Mountain

Long ago, in the heart of Timor-Leste, there stood a proud mountain named Ramelau. Ramelau was the tallest and mightiest of all the mountains, and he boasted of his strength to the other mountains and the valleys below.

One day, a great storm came to the land. The wind howled and the rain poured, but Ramelau stood firm, refusing to bend. "I am the strongest!" he proclaimed. "I will never surrender to this storm!"

As the storm raged on, Ramelau began to feel the strain. His trees were uprooted, and his rocks began to crumble. Still, he refused to yield.

A wise old banyan tree at Ramelau's base called out to him, "Great Ramelau, there is no shame in surrendering to forces greater than ourselves. True strength lies in knowing when to stand firm and when to bend."

Ramelau, in his pride, ignored the banyan tree's advice. But as the storm grew even fiercer, he realized that his stubbornness was causing more harm than good. With a heavy heart, he finally decided to surrender to the storm.

To his surprise, as soon as he let go of his resistance, he felt a great sense of peace. The wind seemed to caress rather than batter him, and the rain nourished his soil instead of eroding it. When the storm passed, Ramelau emerged stronger and more beautiful than ever before.

From that day on, Ramelau understood the power of surrender. He shared his wisdom with all who came to climb his slopes, teaching them that true strength comes not from constant resistance, but from knowing when to yield and when to stand firm.

## The Practice of "Welcoming In" and "Melting Out"

   - Steps:
     a. Acknowledge the present moment or situation
     b. Open your awareness to all aspects of the experience
     c. Mentally "invite in" even difficult or uncomfortable elements
   - Benefits: Reduces resistance, increases presence, fosters acceptance

2. "Melting Out" (Nabeen Sai)
   - Definition: Releasing tension and resistance, allowing oneself to soften and flow
   - Steps:
     a. Identify areas of tension or resistance in body and mind
     b. Visualize these areas softening or dissolving
     c. Allow a sense of "letting go" to spread throughout your being
   - Benefits: Releases physical and emotional tension, promotes relaxation, facilitates surrender

3. Combining the practices
   - Begin with "Welcoming In" to accept the present moment
   - Transition to "Melting Out" to release resistance
   - Cultivate a continuous flow between acceptance and release

4. Applications in daily life

## Guided Meditation Script: Surrendering to the Ground of Grace

Find a comfortable seated position, with your spine straight but not rigid. Allow your eyes to gently close.

Take a few deep breaths, feeling your body settle into its natural rhythm of breathing.

Bring your awareness to the earth beneath you. Feel the solid ground supporting your body.

Imagine that this ground is not just physical, but a vast field of grace, always present, always supporting you.

As you breathe in, feel this grace rising up through your body, nourishing every cell.

As you breathe out, allow yourself to soften, to surrender a little more into this ground of grace.

If you notice any tension or resistance in your body or mind, gently acknowledge it. Say to yourself, "I welcome this too."

With each breath, invite yourself to relax more deeply into the support that is always here.

You may notice thoughts or feelings arising. Let them come and go, like clouds passing in the sky. The ground of grace remains constant beneath them.

Take a moment to recognize that this ground of grace is not separate from you. You are part of it, held within it always.

As we come to the end of this meditation, carry with you the sense of being held and supported. Know that you can return to this awareness at any time.

Slowly open your eyes, bringing this sense of grace and surrender into your day.
