## Short Story: "The Bridge of Trust"

In a small village nestled in the mountains of Timor-Leste, there lived two families who had been at odds for generations. The source of their conflict had been lost to time, but the fear and mistrust remained.

One day, a great storm came, washing away the bridge that connected their two sides of the village. Both families found themselves isolated, unable to reach the market or their fields.

An elder from one family, remembering the teachings of grace she had learned, proposed that they work together to rebuild the bridge. At first, the idea was met with skepticism and fear. But as food grew scarce, they realized they had no choice but to cooperate.

Slowly, cautiously, members of both families began to work side by side. As they labored, they shared stories, meals, and eventually, laughter. The bridge they built was stronger than the one that had been lost, just as the bonds they formed were stronger than the fears that had divided them.

When the bridge was complete, they held a ceremony, invoking the spirit of their ancestors and the grace of Maromak. They named it the "Bridge of Trust," a symbol of their newfound unity.

From that day forward, the families chose to live in the grace of trust rather than the shadow of fear, transforming not just their own lives, but the future of their village.

## Guided Meditation Script: Cultivating Trust in the Ground of Grace

Find a comfortable position and gently close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths, allowing your body to relax with each exhale.

Imagine yourself standing on the rich, fertile soil of Timor-Leste. Feel the ground beneath your feet, solid and supportive. This is the ground of grace, always present, always supporting you.

As you stand here, become aware of any fears or doubts you're carrying. Without judgment, simply notice them. Now, imagine these fears as heavy stones in your hands.

One by one, gently place these stones on the ground before you. As each stone touches the earth, feel a sense of relief, of letting go.

Now, turn your attention to the warmth of the sun on your skin. This is the warmth of grace, of unconditional love. Let it soak into your being, filling you with light and comfort.

Feel the gentle breeze, carrying the whispers of your ancestors, reminding you of your resilience, your strength. This too is grace, supporting and guiding you.

Look around and see that you are not alone. Your community stands with you, each person also supported by this ground of grace. Feel the connection between you, the trust that is possible.

Take a moment to appreciate the peace and strength you feel in this moment. Know that you can return to this place, this feeling, whenever you need to.

When you're ready, gently open your eyes, carrying this sense of trust and grace with you.
