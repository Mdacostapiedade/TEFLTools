## Timorese Reconciliation Story: The Unrolling of the Big Mat

In the village of Laleia, two families had been locked in a bitter land dispute for generations. The conflict had divided the community and caused much suffering. One day, the village elder called for a "nahe biti boot" ceremony.

The two families gathered on a large woven mat in the center of the village. The elder spoke of the importance of unity and the pain caused by division. He asked each family to share their grievances and listen to the other with open hearts.

As the sun set, the families began to see the humanity in each other's struggles. Slowly, they found common ground and agreed to share the disputed land. The elder then symbolically rolled up the mat, signifying the end of the conflict.

From that day forward, the families worked together on the land, and their cooperation brought prosperity to the entire village. The story of the "unrolling of the big mat" became a symbol of reconciliation throughout Timor-Leste.

## Case Study: Compassion-Based Reconciliation in Liquiça

In 1999, the town of Liquiça experienced a brutal massacre that left deep scars in the community. In 2010, a group of survivors initiated a compassion-based reconciliation program. The program included:

1. Monthly dialogue circles between victims and former perpetrators
2. Communal art projects symbolizing healing and unity
3. Joint community service activities
4. Traditional healing rituals led by local spiritual leaders
5. Training in compassion meditation for all participants

Over five years, the program led to:
- Decreased tension and increased cooperation in the community
- Healing of trauma symptoms among participants
- Successful reintegration of former perpetrators
- A community-led peace education initiative in local schools

This case study demonstrates how compassion-based approaches can support long-term reconciliation and healing in post-conflict settings.
