# Excerpts and Short Stories

## The Bamboo and the Storm

In a small village in Timor-Leste, there stood a tall bamboo tree. One day, a fierce storm came, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. While other trees fought against the wind, the bamboo bent and swayed gracefully.

A young boy watched in amazement as the bamboo survived the storm unharmed. He asked his grandfather, "How did the bamboo not break?"

The grandfather smiled and said, "The bamboo teaches us about grace. It does not resist the wind but moves with it. It is strong because it is flexible. In life, we too can learn to bend without breaking, to flow with challenges rather than fight them."

The boy nodded, understanding that true strength comes from adaptability and grace, not rigidity.
