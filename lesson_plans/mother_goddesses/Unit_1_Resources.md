### The Legend of Bui Iku

Long ago, in the mountains of Timor-Leste, there lived a powerful goddess named Bui Iku. She was known as the mother of all living things, with the ability to bring forth life from the earth and control the waters that nourished the land.

Bui Iku had long, flowing hair that reached the ground, and when she combed it, seeds would fall from her tresses, sprouting into lush vegetation wherever they landed. Her eyes were said to be as deep as the ocean, and when she cried, her tears formed rivers and streams that brought water to the people.

One day, a great drought struck the land. The people prayed to Bui Iku for help. She heard their pleas and decided to sacrifice herself for the good of all. She lay down on the parched earth, and her body transformed into the landscape. Her hair became the forests, her bones the mountains, and her blood the rivers. From that day on, the people of Timor-Leste have honored Bui Iku as the mother goddess who gave her life to sustain theirs.

### The Tale of Maromak Oan

In the heart of Timor-Leste, there is a sacred tale of Maromak Oan, the daughter of God. She was sent to Earth to watch over the Timorese people and ensure their prosperity.

Maromak Oan took the form of a beautiful woman with skin as golden as the sun and eyes that sparkled like stars. She taught the people how to cultivate the land, care for animals, and live in harmony with nature. Her laughter brought the rains, and her gentle touch made the crops grow strong.

However, Maromak Oan was not only a nurturing figure. When the people became greedy or disrespectful of the natural world, she would unleash her fury through storms and earthquakes, reminding them of the importance of balance and respect.

To this day, many Timorese believe that Maromak Oan continues to watch over them, guiding their lives and protecting their land. They honor her through rituals and by maintaining a deep connection with the natural world she entrusted to their care.
