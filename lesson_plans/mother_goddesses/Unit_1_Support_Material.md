## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited prior knowledge of mother goddess concepts.
   **Solution**: Begin with a general discussion about nurturing figures in students' lives to create a relatable foundation before introducing goddess concepts.

2. **Challenge**: Some students may feel uncomfortable discussing spiritual beliefs different from their own.
   **Solution**: Emphasize respect for diverse beliefs and focus on cultural and historical aspects rather than religious truth claims.

3. **Challenge**: Limited resources on Timor-Leste specific mother goddess traditions.
   **Solution**: Encourage students to interview family members or local elders to gather oral traditions and personal stories.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in understanding the dual nature (creative and destructive) of mother goddesses.
   **Solution**: Use examples from nature (e.g., forest fires that lead to new growth) to illustrate the concept of necessary destruction for renewal.

5. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to connect ancient goddess concepts to modern life.
   **Solution**: Discuss how goddess symbolism appears in contemporary culture (e.g., Mother Nature in environmental movements) and explore local festivals or traditions that may have roots in goddess worship.
