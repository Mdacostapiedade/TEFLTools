## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may be hesitant to share personal beliefs or experiences.
   **Solution**: Create a safe, non-judgmental environment. Emphasize that the goal is understanding, not agreement. Allow students to share anonymously if preferred.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in accessing traditional ceremonial items.
   **Solution**: Encourage creativity in using symbolic representations. Collaborate with local community members to borrow or recreate items.

3. **Challenge**: Balancing respect for traditional beliefs with critical analysis.
   **Solution**: Frame discussions in terms of cultural understanding rather than truth claims. Encourage students to compare beliefs with scientific explanations without dismissing either.

4. **Challenge**: Students from different religious backgrounds may feel uncomfortable.
   **Solution**: Emphasize the academic nature of the study. Draw parallels with students' own cultural beliefs where appropriate.

5. **Challenge**: Limited information on specific Timor-Leste traditions.
   **Solution**: Encourage students to conduct interviews with family members or community elders. Use this as an opportunity to discuss the importance of preserving oral traditions.
