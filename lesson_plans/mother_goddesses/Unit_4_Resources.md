# Additional Materials

## Excerpt from "The Sacred Springs of Timor-Leste" by Maria da Costa (fictional text for illustrative purposes)

"As the first light of dawn broke over the hills, Avó Marta led us down the winding path to Be Malae spring. The air was thick with the scent of frangipani and the distant sound of waves lapping against Atauro's shore. 'This water,' she said, dipping her gnarled hands into the crystal-clear pool, 'has flowed since the time of our ancestors. It carries their wisdom, their strength.'

She cupped the water in her palms, lifting it towards the sky in offering. 'We come here not just to drink or to wash,' Avó Marta continued, her voice low and reverent, 'but to connect with the spirits of the water, of our land. They protect us, guide us, but also demand our respect.'

As if on cue, a gentle breeze rustled through the surrounding trees, carrying with it the faintest whisper of otherworldly voices. I shivered, not from cold, but from the palpable sense of the sacred that permeated this place. Avó Marta smiled, reading my expression. 'Yes, child. The spirits are always here, watching, listening. Remember this when you take from the spring. Always give thanks, always show respect.'"
