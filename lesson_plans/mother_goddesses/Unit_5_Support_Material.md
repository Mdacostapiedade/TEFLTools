## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students from different cultural backgrounds may have varying levels of familiarity with mother goddess concepts.
   **Solution**: Encourage students to share their own cultural perspectives and emphasize that there's no "right" or "wrong" interpretation.

2. **Challenge**: Some students may feel uncomfortable discussing personal family experiences.
   **Solution**: Make sharing optional and provide alternative prompts focusing on general cultural observations rather than personal experiences.

3. **Challenge**: Students might struggle to connect ancient goddess concepts with modern life.
   **Solution**: Provide contemporary examples of how mother goddess ideas influence current practices or beliefs in various cultures.

4. **Challenge**: Maintaining respect for diverse spiritual beliefs while encouraging critical thinking.
   **Solution**: Establish ground rules for respectful discussion and frame the lesson as an exploration of cultural practices rather than a debate on religious truth.

5. **Challenge**: Limited access to resources about Timor-Leste culture specifically.
   **Solution**: Supplement with broader resources on Southeast Asian cultures and encourage students to conduct interviews with community members to gather local knowledge.
