# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Mountain Agriculture in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts with maps of Timor-Leste's mountain regions
- Photos/videos of traditional mountain farming practices
- Transportation for field trip
- Notebooks and pens for students

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe the geographic and climatic conditions of Timor-Leste's mountain regions
- Identify at least 3 key challenges and 3 opportunities for mountain agriculture
- Explain 2-3 traditional farming practices used in Timor-Leste's mountains
- Discuss potential impacts of climate change on mountain agriculture

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Show students a series of photos of mountain farms in Timor-Leste. Ask them to identify what they see and discuss in pairs:
- What crops are being grown?
- What challenges might farmers face in this environment?
- What advantages might this environment offer?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Agroecosystem
- Terracing
- Intercropping
- Climate resilience
- Food security

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Overview of Timor-Leste's Mountain Ecosystems
- Geographic features: elevation, slope, soil types
- Climatic conditions: rainfall patterns, temperature ranges
- Major mountain ranges and agricultural areas

### Traditional Farming Systems and Crops
- Shifting cultivation practices
- Common staple crops: maize, cassava, sweet potato
- Traditional crop varieties and their adaptations

### Impacts of Climate Change on Mountain Agriculture
- Observed changes in temperature and rainfall patterns
- Effects on crop yields and growing seasons
- Increased risk of erosion and landslides

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

Students work in small groups to:
1. Label key mountain regions on a map of Timor-Leste
2. Match traditional crops to their suitable elevation ranges
3. List potential impacts of climate change on mountain farms

## 7. Production Task: Field Trip (2 hours)

Visit to a local mountain farm:
- Observe and document farming practices
- Interview farmers about challenges and opportunities
- Sketch farm layout and crop arrangements

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

Class discussion:
- What were the most interesting observations from the field trip?
- How do the realities of mountain farming compare to initial expectations?
- What questions remain about mountain agriculture in Timor-Leste?

## 9. Homework Assignment

Write a 2-page reflection paper addressing:
1. Three key challenges facing mountain farmers in Timor-Leste
2. Three opportunities for improving mountain agriculture
3. One traditional practice observed and its potential benefits/drawbacks

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Agroecosystem: An ecosystem modified by humans for agricultural production
- Terracing: Creating level planting areas on hillsides to reduce erosion and conserve water
- Intercropping: Growing two or more crops in proximity to maximize land use and interactions
- Climate resilience: The ability to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to climate-related events and trends
- Food security: The state of having reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food
