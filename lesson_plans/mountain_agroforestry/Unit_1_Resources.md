# Lecture Notes

## Overview of Timor-Leste's Mountain Ecosystems

### Geographic Features
- Elevation: Ranges from sea level to 2,963m (Mount Ramelau)
- Slope: Steep terrain, often 30-60% gradients
- Soil types: 
  - Shallow, rocky soils on steep slopes
  - Clay-rich soils in valleys
  - Generally low in organic matter and nutrients

### Climatic Conditions
- Rainfall patterns:
  - Wet season: November to April
  - Dry season: May to October
  - Annual rainfall: 1,500-2,000mm in mountains
- Temperature ranges:
  - Lowlands: 21-35째C
  - Mountains: 15-25째C
  - Frost possible above 2,000m

### Major Mountain Ranges and Agricultural Areas
- Ramelau Range: Central highlands, includes highest peak
- Matebian Range: Eastern region
- Kablaki Range: South-central area
- Key agricultural areas:
  - Aileu: Coffee, vegetables
  - Ermera: Coffee, fruit trees
  - Ainaro: Maize, potatoes, coffee

## Traditional Farming Systems and Crops

### Shifting Cultivation Practices
- Locally known as "to처s"
- Slash-and-burn technique
- Rotation cycle: 2-3 years cultivation, 5-7 years fallow
- Challenges: Soil erosion, declining fertility with population pressure

### Common Staple Crops
- Maize: Primary staple, grown up to 1,800m
- Cassava: Drought-tolerant, grown up to 1,500m
- Sweet potato: Important food security crop, up to 2,000m
- Rice: Paddy cultivation in valley bottoms

### Traditional Crop Varieties and Adaptations
- Local maize varieties: Drought and pest resistant
- Native yams: Adapted to poor soils
- Taro: Grown in water-abundant areas
- Coffee: Shade-grown Arabica in highlands

## Impacts of Climate Change on Mountain Agriculture

### Observed Changes
- Temperature increase: 0.016째C per year since 1950
- Rainfall patterns: More intense rain events, longer dry spells
- Sea level rise: Affecting coastal areas and saline intrusion

### Effects on Crop Yields and Growing Seasons
- Shortened growing seasons for some crops
- Increased water stress during dry periods
- Shifts in suitable elevation ranges for crops
- New pest and disease pressures

### Increased Risk of Erosion and Landslides
- More intense rainfall events leading to soil loss
- Landslides threatening farmland and infrastructure
- Need for improved soil conservation techniques

# Discussion Questions

1. How do the geographic and climatic conditions of Timor-Leste's mountains shape agricultural practices?
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of traditional shifting cultivation in mountain areas?
3. How might climate change impact food security for mountain communities in Timor-Leste?
4. What role do traditional crop varieties play in mountain agriculture, and how might their importance change with climate change?
5. How can farmers balance the need for increased production with sustainable land management in mountain ecosystems?
6. What are some potential strategies for adapting mountain agriculture to changing climatic conditions?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay comparing and contrasting traditional mountain farming practices in Timor-Leste with modern sustainable agriculture techniques. Consider the following points:

- Environmental impact
- Productivity and food security
- Cultural significance
- Adaptability to climate change

Use specific examples from the lecture notes and field trip observations to support your arguments.

# Assignment Details

## Field Trip Report

Prepare a detailed report on the mountain farm visited during the field trip. The report should include:

1. Introduction (farm location, size, elevation)
2. Farm layout sketch with crop placement
3. List of crops grown and their characteristics
4. Description of farming practices observed (e.g., terracing, intercropping)
5. Summary of farmer interview (challenges, opportunities, traditional knowledge)
6. Personal observations and reflections
7. Recommendations for sustainable improvements

Length: 1000-1500 words
Format: Double-spaced, 12-point font
Due date: One week after the field trip
