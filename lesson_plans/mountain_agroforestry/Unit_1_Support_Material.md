# Support Material for Introduction to Mountain Agriculture in Timor-Leste

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Agroecosystem**: An ecosystem modified by humans for agricultural production
- **Terracing**: Creating level planting areas on hillsides to reduce erosion and conserve water
- **Intercropping**: Growing two or more crops in proximity to maximize land use and interactions
- **Climate resilience**: The ability to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to climate-related events and trends
- **Food security**: The state of having reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food
- **Shifting cultivation**: A farming method where land is cleared for cultivation, used for a short time, then left to regenerate
- **Erosion**: The process of soil and rock being worn away by natural forces like water or wind
- **Biodiversity**: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
- **Subsistence farming**: A form of farming in which nearly all of the crops or livestock raised are used to maintain the farmer and the farmer's family

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Mountain Agriculture: Opportunities for Harnessing Zero Hunger in Asia" by FAO
2. "Climate Change and Food Security in Mountains" by the Mountain Partnership
3. "Indigenous Knowledge and Sustainable Mountain Development" by ICIMOD
4. Online course: "Mountain Agriculture and Rural Development" by SDG Academy
5. Video series: "Voices from the Mountains" by UNDP Timor-Leste

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language barriers**: Prepare key terms in both English and Tetum. Consider using visual aids and demonstrations to overcome language challenges.

2. **Limited prior knowledge**: Begin with a basic overview of Timor-Leste's geography and agriculture before diving into mountain-specific content.

3. **Misconceptions about traditional practices**: Emphasize the value of indigenous knowledge while also discussing areas for potential improvement.

4. **Difficulty relating to mountain environments**: If students are from lowland areas, use plenty of visual aids and, if possible, organize a field trip to help them understand mountain conditions.

5. **Addressing climate change skepticism**: Focus on observable changes and their impacts on agriculture, rather than debating the causes of climate change.

6. **Limited resources for field trips**: If a physical field trip isn't possible, consider virtual alternatives like video tours or inviting a mountain farmer to speak to the class.

7. **Engaging students with diverse backgrounds**: Use group activities that allow students to share their own experiences and knowledge related to agriculture and rural life.

8. **Balancing theory and practice**: Incorporate hands-on activities whenever possible, such as seed sorting, soil testing, or mini terrace-building exercises in the classroom.
