Research Center (UARC), Luang Prabang, Lao PDR
12.1 Overview
12.1.1 About the country
Lao PDR is a landlocked country in Southeast Asia, 
bordered by China to the north, Viet Nam to the east, Cambodia to the south, Thailand to the west, and Myanmar to the northwest. The country has a total land area of 236 800 km
2 and a population of 6.9 million 
(2017). Lao PDR is the only landlocked country in Southeast Asia, although the Mekong River forms a large part of its western boundary with Thailand. It is a mountainous country with substantial forest coverage. The climate is tropical and in/f_luenced by the southeast monsoon, which causes signi/f_icant rainfall and high humidity.
Lao PDR is divided into three regions: northern, central 
and southern. The northern region is dominated by mountains, which form part of the South-East Asian massif. The central region is characterized by /f_lat plains along the Mekong River and low mountains along the border with Viet Nam. The southern region is dominated by the Bolaven Plateau, a large, elevated region that sits to the east of the Mekong River.
Lao PDR is a lower middle-income country with a 
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of USD 2 457 (2017). The country has experienced rapid economic growth in recent years, with an average annual GDP growth rate of 7.8 percent over the past decade. The economy is largely based on natural resources and agriculture, which together account for about 40 percent of GDP and 80 percent of employment. The country has signi/f_icant mineral resources, including copper, gold, and bauxite, and exports electricity to neighboring countries.
Despite its rapid economic growth, Lao PDR still faces 
signi/f_icant development challenges, including high poverty rates, limited access to education and health services, and environmental degradation. The government has set ambitious targets for poverty reduction and economic development, including graduating from least developed country status by 2020.
12.1.2 Demographics
The population of Lao PDR is estimated at 6.9 million 
(2017), with an annual growth rate of 1.5 percent. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 23 years. The majority of the population (67 percent) lives in rural areas, although urbanization is increasing rapidly. The country is ethnically diverse, with 49 oﬃcially recognized ethnic groups. The largest ethnic group is the Lao, who make up about 53 percent of the population. Other major ethnic groups include the Khmu (11 percent) and the Hmong (9 percent).
The population is unevenly distributed across the 
country, with the majority concentrated in the lowland areas along the Mekong River. The northern and eastern regions of the country are more sparsely populated. The capital city, Vientiane, has a population of about 820 000 (2015) and is the largest urban center in the country.
12.1.3 Economy
Lao PDR has experienced rapid economic growth in 
recent years, with an average annual GDP growth rate of 7.8 percent over the past decade. The country's economy is largely based on natural resources and agriculture, which together account for about 40 percent of GDP and 80 percent of employment. The industrial sector, including mining and hydropower, has grown rapidly in recent years and now accounts for about 30 percent of GDP . The service sector, including tourism, accounts for about 30 percent of GDP .
The country has signi/f_icant mineral resources, including 
copper, gold, and bauxite, which have attracted substantial foreign investment in recent years. Lao PDR also has signi/f_icant hydropower potential and exports electricity to neighboring countries. Agriculture remains an important sector of the economy, with rice being the main crop. Other important agricultural products include coﬀee, maize, and cassava.

Despite its rapid economic growth, Lao PDR still faces 
signi/f_icant development challenges, including high poverty rates, limited access to education and health services, and environmental degradation. The government has set ambitious targets for poverty reduction and economic development, including graduating from least developed country status by 2020.
12.1.4 Hunger and all forms of malnutrition
Despite signi/f_icant progress in recent years, hunger and 
malnutrition remain signi/f_icant challenges in Lao PDR. According to the 2015 National Nutrition Survey, 33 percent of children under /f_ive years of age are stunted (low height for age), 21 percent are underweight (low weight for age), and 9 percent are wasted (low weight for height). These rates are higher in rural areas and among ethnic minority groups.
Micronutrient de/f_iciencies are also common, with 
44 percent of children under /f_ive years of age and 31 percent of women of reproductive age suﬀering from anemia. Vitamin A de/f_iciency aﬀects 30 percent of children under /f_ive years of age, and iodine de/f_iciency aﬀects 25 percent of school-age children.
Food insecurity remains a signi/f_icant problem in some 
areas of the country, particularly in rural and remote areas. According to the 2015 Food and Nutrition Security Survey, 20 percent of households are food insecure, with higher rates in rural areas (24 percent) compared to urban areas (11 percent).
The government has made addressing hunger and 
malnutrition a priority, with a focus on improving food security, increasing agricultural productivity, and improving nutrition education and health services. However, signi/f_icant challenges remain, including limited access to health services and nutrition education in rural areas, and the need to address underlying causes of malnutrition such as poverty and lack of access to clean water and sanitation.
12.1.5 Poverty
Poverty remains a signi/f_icant challenge in Lao PDR, 
despite signi/f_icant progress in recent years. According to the latest poverty assessment conducted in 2012/13, the national poverty rate was 23.2 percent, down from 33.5 percent in 2002/03. However, poverty rates vary signi/f_icantly across the country, with higher rates in rural areas (28.6 percent) compared to urban areas (10 percent).
Poverty is particularly high in the upland areas of the 
country, where many ethnic minority groups live. These areas are characterized by limited access to markets, services, and infrastructure, as well as lower agricultural productivity. The poverty rate in the northern region, which is predominantly mountainous, was 32.5 percent in 2012/13, compared to 18.8 percent in the central region and 16.4 percent in the southern region.
The government has made poverty reduction a key 
priority, with a focus on improving access to education, health services, and infrastructure in rural areas, as well as promoting economic growth and job creation. However, signi/f_icant challenges remain, including the need to address disparities between urban and rural areas and between diﬀerent ethnic groups.Figure 12.1 Agro-ecological zones of Lao PDRFigure 12.2 Distribution of annual rainfall in Lao PDR

MOUNTAIN AGRICULTURE  Opportunities for harnessing Zero Hunger in Asia 19912.2  About mountains in Lao PDR
12.2.1 Physical characteristics
Lao PDR is a mountainous country, with about 
80 percent of its land area classi/f_ied as mountainous or upland. The country is divided into three main regions: the northern region, which is characterized by high mountains and narrow valleys; the central region, which is dominated by the Annamite mountain range; and the southern region, which includes the Bolaven Plateau.
The northern region is the most mountainous, with 
elevations ranging from 500 to 2 800 meters above sea level. The highest peak in the country, Phou Bia, is located in this region and reaches an elevation of 2 819 meters. The central region is characterized by a mix of mountains and plateaus, with elevations ranging from 500 to 1 500 meters above sea level. The southern region is dominated by the Bolaven Plateau, which has an average elevation of 1 000 meters above sea level.
The mountainous terrain of Lao PDR has a signi/f_icant 
impact on the country's climate, hydrology, and biodiversity. The mountains create a barrier to monsoon winds, resulting in signi/f_icant variations in rainfall across the country. The northern and eastern regions receive more rainfall than the central and southern regions, with annual rainfall ranging from 1 300 to 3 000 mm.
The mountains also play an important role in the 
country's hydrology, with many of the country's major rivers originating in the mountainous regions. The Mekong River, which forms a large part of the country's western border, is fed by numerous tributaries that originate in the mountains of Lao PDR.
12.2.2 Demographics
The mountainous regions of Lao PDR are home to many 
of the country's ethnic minority groups, who make up about 40 percent of the total population. These groups have traditionally practiced shifting cultivation and relied on forest resources for their livelihoods. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards more settled agriculture and cash crop production in many mountainous areas.
The population density in mountainous areas is generally 
lower than in lowland areas, with many remote villages having limited access to markets, services, and infrastructure. However, urbanization is increasing in some mountainous areas, particularly in provincial capitals and along major transportation routes.
12.2.3  Economy: Major economic activities, 
sources of livelihood
The economy of mountainous regions in Lao PDR is 
largely based on agriculture and natural resource extraction. Traditional agricultural practices, such as shifting cultivation, are still common in many areas, although there has been a shift towards more permanent agriculture and cash crop production in recent years.
Major agricultural products in mountainous areas include 
rice, maize, cassava, and coﬀee. In some areas, there has been a signi/f_icant expansion of commercial tree plantations, particularly rubber and eucalyptus. Non-timber forest products, such as cardamom and benzoin, are also important sources of income for many mountain
