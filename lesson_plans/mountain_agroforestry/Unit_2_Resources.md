## Soil Erosion Control

### Principles of Soil Erosion on Mountain Slopes
- Steep slopes increase water runoff velocity and erosion potential
- Lack of vegetation cover exposes soil to rain impact and wind
- Shallow mountain soils are easily eroded once vegetation is removed
- Erosion removes fertile topsoil, reducing agricultural productivity
- Eroded sediment can pollute waterways and cause flooding downstream

### Importance of Vegetation Cover and Root Systems  
- Plant roots help bind soil particles together
- Vegetation slows water runoff and increases infiltration
- Leaf litter protects soil surface from rain impact
- Plants take up water, reducing soil moisture and potential for landslides
- Native vegetation is adapted to local conditions and provides best protection

## Terracing and Contour Farming

### Types of Terraces
- Bench terraces: Flat surfaces with vertical walls, suitable for steeper slopes
- Sloping terraces: Gently sloped surfaces, easier to construct
- Stone-walled terraces: Use local stone to reinforce terrace walls
- Grass strip terraces: Use vegetation to stabilize terrace edges

### Contour Farming Technique
- Plowing and planting along contour lines instead of up and down slope
- Creates small ridges and furrows that slow water runoff
- Can be combined with terracing for greater effectiveness
- Suitable for moderate slopes (up to 10%)

### Benefits of Terracing and Contour Farming
- Reduces soil erosion by slowing water runoff
- Increases water infiltration and soil moisture retention
- Allows cultivation on steeper slopes
- Can increase crop yields by 30% or more
- Reduces fertilizer and pesticide runoff

## Mulching and Cover Cropping

### Benefits of Mulching
- Protects soil surface from rain impact and wind erosion
- Reduces evaporation, conserving soil moisture
- Suppresses weed growth
- Moderates soil temperature fluctuations
- Adds organic matter to soil as mulch decomposes

### Cover Cropping
- Planting crops specifically to cover and protect soil
- Can be used during fallow periods or between rows of main crop
- Legume cover crops add nitrogen to soil
- Deep-rooted cover crops can break up compacted soil layers
- Can be incorporated into soil as "green manure"

## Rainwater Harvesting

### Basic Techniques for Mountain Regions
- Rooftop collection: Gutters and storage tanks to collect roof runoff
- Contour bunds: Earth or stone ridges along contours to trap runoff
- Check dams: Small dams in gullies to capture water and reduce erosion
- Infiltration pits: Holes filled with gravel to increase groundwater recharge

### Storage Options
- Above-ground tanks: Concrete, plastic, or metal
- Underground cisterns: Can be larger capacity, less visible
- Farm ponds: Larger storage for irrigation, can be lined or unlined
- Subsurface dams: Underground barriers to trap groundwater flow

### Potential Uses of Harvested Water
- Domestic use (with proper treatment)
- Supplemental irrigation for crops
- Livestock watering
- Aquaculture
- Groundwater recharge

# Discussion Questions

1. What are the main causes of soil erosion in mountain regions of Timor-Leste? How do these compare to erosion issues in other areas you're familiar with?

2. How might climate change impact soil erosion and water availability in mountain areas? What conservation techniques might become more important?

3. What are some potential challenges to implementing terracing or contour farming in small-scale mountain farms? How might these be overcome?

4. How can traditional ecological knowledge be integrated with modern soil and water conservation techniques? Give some specific examples.

5. What are the pros and cons of different rainwater storage options for mountain farms? Which do you think would be most appropriate for small-scale farmers in Timor-Leste?

6. How might soil and water conservation techniques need to be adapted for different crops or farming systems common in Timor-Leste's mountains?

7. What role can government policies or programs play in promoting soil and water conservation in mountain regions? What specific policies would you recommend?

# Writing Exercise

Write a 1-2 page proposal for implementing soil and water conservation techniques on a small (2 hectare) mountain farm in Timor-Leste. Include the following elements:

- Brief description of the farm's current conditions and challenges
- 2-3 specific conservation techniques you recommend implementing
- Justification for why you chose these techniques
- Basic implementation plan (materials needed, labor required, timeline)
- Expected benefits and potential challenges
- How you would measure the success of the interventions

Use the lecture content and your own research to support your recommendations. Be sure to consider the specific context of mountain agriculture in Timor-Leste.

# Assignment Details

## Terrace Building Exercise

### Materials Needed (per group):
- 4-6 wooden stakes
- 20 meters of string
- 2 shovels
- 1 hoe
- 1 watering can
- Soil and gravel

### Instructions:
1. Mark out a 3m x 1m area on a slight slope using stakes and string
2. Use shovels and hoe to create a level platform, moving soil from upslope to downslope
3. Create a small berm at the downslope edge to retain water
4. Use gravel to reinforce the outer edge of the terrace
5. Test the terrace by gently watering it and observing water flow
6. Be prepared to explain your design choices to the class

## Water Harvesting Design Activity

### Materials Needed (per pair):
- Large sheet of paper
- Colored pencils or markers
- Ruler

### Instructions:
1. Design a rainwater harvesting system for a 1-hectare mountain farm
2. Include at least 2 different harvesting techniques (e.g. rooftop collection, contour bunds)
3. Show water storage method(s) and how water will be used
4. Include a simple diagram of the farm layout and harvesting system
5. List materials that would be needed to implement your design
6. Be prepared to present and justify your design to the class
