Here is some support material for the lesson on Soil and Water Conservation Techniques:

# Support Material

## 1. Key Vocabulary List

- Soil erosion: The removal of topsoil by wind or water
- Terracing: Creating level platforms on hillsides to reduce erosion and improve farming conditions
- Contour farming: Plowing and planting across the slope following the contour lines
- Mulching: Covering soil with organic material to retain moisture and prevent erosion  
- Cover cropping: Planting crops to cover soil when main crops are not growing
- Rainwater harvesting: Collecting and storing rainwater for later use

## 2. Visual Aids (Descriptions)

1. Diagram showing cross-section of a terraced hillside, with labels for:
   - Terrace walls
   - Flat planting areas
   - Water flow paths

2. Illustration comparing erosion on a bare slope vs. a contour-farmed slope

3. Infographic on benefits of mulching:
   - Moisture retention
   - Weed suppression  
   - Soil temperature regulation
   - Erosion control

4. Schematic of a basic rainwater harvesting system for a mountain farm, including:
   - Catchment area (e.g. roof)
   - Gutters and pipes
   - Storage tank
   - Distribution system

## 3. Handouts/Worksheets

1. Terrace design worksheet:
   - Diagram of a slope 
   - Instructions to draw terrace layout
   - Questions on terrace spacing and dimensions

2. Water harvesting calculation sheet:
   - Formula for calculating potential rainwater collection
   - Table to fill in local rainfall data
   - Space to design a system for a given scenario

## 4. Additional Resources

- FAO Manual on "Mountain Agriculture: Opportunities for Harnessing Zero Hunger in Asia"
- Video series on terrace building techniques from ICIMOD
- Practical Action technical brief on rainwater harvesting
- Local case studies of successful soil and water conservation projects in Timor-Leste

## 5. Tips for Teachers

- Potential challenge: Students may have limited experience with mountain farming
  - Solution: Arrange a field trip to a local mountain farm early in the unit

- Potential challenge: Abstract concepts may be difficult to grasp
  - Solution: Use plenty of visual aids and hands-on activities

- Potential challenge: Local practices may differ from textbook examples
  - Solution: Invite local farmers to share their knowledge and experiences

- Potential challenge: Limited materials for practical exercises
  - Solution: Use locally available materials for demonstrations (e.g. soil, rocks, plant materials)

- Potential challenge: Varying levels of prior knowledge among students
  - Solution: Use group work to encourage peer learning and support
