# Lesson Plan: Crop Diversification and Climate-Resilient Varieties

## 1. Resources Needed

- Seeds of various climate-resilient crop varieties (e.g. drought-tolerant maize, legumes)
- Samples of local crop varieties 
- Handouts on crop rotation and intercropping principles
- Flipchart and markers
- Projector for presentations
- Small plots of land for planting demonstration

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify at least 3 climate-resilient crop varieties suitable for Timor-Leste's mountain regions
- Explain the principles of crop rotation and intercropping
- Design a diverse cropping system incorporating climate-resilient varieties

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- In small groups, students brainstorm challenges faced by mountain farmers in Timor-Leste related to crop production
- Groups share their ideas with the class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

- Climate-resilient varieties
- Crop rotation
- Intercropping
- Agroforestry
- Legumes
- Cover crops

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of climate-resilient crop varieties suitable for Timor-Leste's mountains
- Principles and benefits of crop rotation
- Intercropping techniques and advantages
- Introduction to agroforestry systems for mountain regions

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

- In pairs, students match climate-resilient crop varieties to specific mountain conditions (e.g. drought-prone areas, steep slopes)
- Small groups create a crop rotation plan for a hypothetical mountain farm
- Class discussion on potential intercropping combinations for Timor-Leste

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Seed exchange activity: Students bring local seeds to share and discuss their characteristics
- In groups, students design a diverse cropping system for a model mountain farm, incorporating climate-resilient varieties, rotation, and intercropping

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Groups present their cropping system designs
- Class discussion on how these systems address challenges identified in the warm-up
- Quick review of key concepts covered

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research one climate-resilient crop variety in depth, including its characteristics, growing requirements, and potential benefits for mountain farmers in Timor-Leste
- Prepare a short presentation for the next class

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Climate-resilient varieties: Crop varieties bred to withstand environmental stresses like drought or extreme temperatures
- Crop rotation: The practice of growing different crops in the same area across seasons to improve soil health and reduce pest pressure
- Intercropping: Growing two or more crops in proximity to maximize land use and increase biodiversity
- Agroforestry: A land use management system that combines trees or shrubs with crops and/or livestock
- Legumes: Plants in the family Fabaceae, often able to fix nitrogen in the soil
- Cover crops: Crops planted primarily to manage soil quality, erosion, fertility, and water
