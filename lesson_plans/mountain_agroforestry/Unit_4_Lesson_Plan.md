# Lesson Plan: Sustainable Livestock Management in Mountain Areas

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and laptop
- Handouts on small ruminant management practices
- Photos/videos of mountain livestock systems
- Samples of local fodder crops
- Manure samples (if available)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the benefits and challenges of livestock management in mountain areas
- Describe appropriate practices for small ruminant management in Timor-Leste's mountains
- Identify suitable fodder crops for marginal mountain lands
- Explain the importance of manure management for soil fertility

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show photos of different livestock in mountain settings
- Ask students to identify the animals and discuss what challenges they might face in mountain environments

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

- Write key terms on the board and briefly explain:
  - Small ruminants
  - Fodder
  - Marginal lands
  - Manure management
  - Integrated crop-livestock systems

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Small Ruminant Management
- Discuss benefits of goats and sheep for mountain farms
- Explain appropriate housing, feeding, and health management practices
- Highlight importance of breed selection for mountain conditions

### Fodder Production on Marginal Lands
- Introduce concept of using steep or poor quality land for fodder
- Present examples of suitable fodder crops for Timor-Leste's mountains
- Explain techniques for establishing and maintaining fodder plots

### Manure Management for Soil Fertility
- Discuss importance of manure for maintaining soil health
- Explain proper collection, storage, and application methods
- Highlight benefits of integrating manure into crop production

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Divide class into small groups
- Provide each group with a scenario of a mountain farm
- Have groups discuss and present strategies for:
  1. Selecting appropriate livestock
  2. Planning fodder production
  3. Integrating manure into crop systems

## 7. Production Task (20 minutes)

- Have students work individually to sketch a plan for integrating livestock into a crop-based mountain farm
- Plan should include:
  1. Type and number of animals
  2. Housing and grazing areas
  3. Fodder production plots
  4. Manure management system

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Address any questions from students
- Preview the upcoming farm visit

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research one traditional livestock management practice used in Timor-Leste's mountains
- Write a short report (1-2 pages) explaining the practice and its benefits/challenges

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Small ruminants: Domesticated animals like goats and sheep that chew cud
- Fodder: Plants grown specifically to feed livestock
- Marginal lands: Areas with poor soil or steep slopes not suitable for crop production
- Manure management: The collection, storage, treatment and utilization of animal dung
- Integrated crop-livestock systems: Farming approaches that combine crop and animal production to maximize resource use efficiency
