# Lecture Notes

## Small Ruminant Management

### Benefits of Goats and Sheep in Mountain Areas
- Adaptable to steep terrain and harsh conditions
- Efficient converters of low-quality forage
- Provide multiple products: meat, milk, fiber, manure
- Require less initial investment compared to larger livestock
- Can be managed by women and children, supporting family livelihoods

### Housing
- Simple, well-ventilated shelters to protect from rain and wind
- Raised slatted floors to keep animals dry and allow easy manure collection
- Separate areas for different age groups and pregnant/nursing females
- Importance of night penning for protection from predators

### Feeding
- Grazing management: rotational grazing to prevent overgrazing
- Supplementary feeding during dry seasons or for pregnant/lactating animals
- Use of locally available feed resources: crop residues, tree fodder, native grasses
- Importance of providing clean water and mineral supplements

### Health Management
- Regular deworming and vaccination schedules
- Hoof trimming and general health checks
- Identifying and treating common diseases: pneumonia, internal parasites, foot rot
- Importance of biosecurity measures to prevent disease spread

### Breed Selection
- Local breeds: Timor goat, Fat-tailed sheep - adapted to local conditions but lower productivity
- Improved breeds: Boer goat, Dorper sheep - higher productivity but require better management
- Crossbreeding strategies to balance adaptation and productivity

## Fodder Production on Marginal Lands

### Suitable Fodder Crops for Timor-Leste Mountains
- Grasses: Napier grass, Guinea grass, Signal grass
- Legumes: Leucaena, Gliricidia, Sesbania
- Multipurpose trees: Moringa, Calliandra

### Establishment Techniques
- Contour planting to prevent erosion
- Use of vegetative propagation methods (cuttings, root splits)
- Intercropping fodder with food crops
- Alley cropping systems on sloping land

### Management Practices
- Cut-and-carry systems to prevent overgrazing
- Proper cutting height and frequency for maximum regrowth
- Fertilization using animal manure to improve yields
- Conservation techniques: hay making, silage production for dry season feed

## Manure Management for Soil Fertility

### Benefits of Manure
- Improves soil structure and water-holding capacity
- Provides balanced nutrients for crop growth
- Enhances soil biological activity
- Reduces dependence on chemical fertilizers

### Collection and Storage
- Daily collection from animal housing
- Proper storage to minimize nutrient loss: covered pits or heaps
- Composting techniques to improve quality and reduce pathogens

### Application Methods
- Timing: apply before planting or as side dressing
- Incorporation into soil to reduce nutrient loss
- Use in vegetable gardens and high-value crop production
- Precautions to avoid contamination of water sources

### Integration with Crop Systems
- Nutrient cycling: using crop residues as feed, returning manure to fields
- Biogas production: using manure for energy, applying slurry to crops
- Vermicomposting: using worms to process manure into high-quality fertilizer

# Discussion Questions

1. How do small ruminants contribute to sustainable livelihoods in mountain communities of Timor-Leste?
2. What are the main challenges in managing livestock on steep mountain slopes, and how can these be addressed?
3. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of local vs. improved livestock breeds for mountain farming systems.
4. How can fodder production on marginal lands contribute to both livestock nutrition and environmental conservation?
5. Discuss the potential conflicts between crop and livestock production in mountain areas. How can these be mitigated through integrated systems?
6. What cultural or social factors might influence the adoption of new livestock management practices in Timorese mountain communities?
7. How might climate change impact livestock management in mountain areas, and what adaptation strategies could be implemented?
8. Discuss the role of women in small ruminant management and how this contributes to family nutrition and income.
9. How can manure management practices be improved to maximize benefits for soil fertility while minimizing environmental risks?
10. What opportunities exist for value addition and marketing of livestock products from mountain areas in Timor-Leste?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Designing a Sustainable Integrated Crop-Livestock System for a Mountain Farm in Timor-Leste"

Your essay should include:
- A description of the hypothetical farm (location, size, current crops)
- Selection of appropriate livestock species and breeds
- Plans for fodder production and grazing management
- Strategies for manure utilization and soil fertility improvement
- Consideration of local environmental and socio-economic factors
- Potential challenges and proposed solutions

Use specific examples and techniques discussed in the lectures. Cite any external sources used.

# Assignment Details

## Farm Visit Report

1. Visit a local mountain livestock farm (as arranged by the instructor).
2. Observe and take notes on:
   - Types and breeds of animals kept
   - Housing and feeding systems
   - Grazing and fodder production practices
   - Manure management methods
   - Any crop-livestock integration strategies
3. Interview the farmer about:
   - Challenges faced in mountain livestock management
   - Traditional practices they use
   - Any new techniques or technologies they've adopted
4. Write a 3-4 page report summarizing your observations and insights from the visit. Include:
   - Description of the farm and its livestock systems
   - Analysis of sustainable practices observed
   - Recommendations for potential improvements
   - Reflection on how the visit enhanced your understanding of mountain livestock management

Due date: One week after the farm visit

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Integrated Goat-Coffee System in East Timor

The Cooperativa Caf√© Timor (CCT) has implemented a successful integrated goat-coffee system in the mountains of East Timor. This case study highlights how:

- Goats are used to control weeds in coffee plantations, reducing labor costs
- Goat manure is applied to coffee trees, improving soil fertility and coffee yields
- Shade trees in coffee plantations provide fodder for goats
- The system provides diversified income through coffee and goat meat/milk sales

Students should read the full case study (provided separately) and be prepared to discuss how similar integrated systems could be applied in other mountain farming contexts.

## Video Resource

"Small Ruminant Management in Mountain Ecosystems" (FAO, 2018)
[Link to be provided by instructor]

This 20-minute video demonstrates best practices for goat and sheep management in mountainous areas, including:
- Appropriate housing designs
- Rotational grazing systems
- Fodder production on terraces
- Simple manure composting techniques

Students should watch the video before the farm visit and take notes on practices that could be applicable in Timor-Leste.
