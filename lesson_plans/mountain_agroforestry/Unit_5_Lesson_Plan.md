# Lesson Plan: Post-Harvest Handling and Value Addition

## 1. Resources Needed

- Mountain Agriculture: Opportunities for Harnessing Zero Hunger in Asia (FAO)
- Sustainable Mountain Agriculture Through Integrated Watershed Management (FAO)
- Local seeds and planting materials
- Materials for building a small storage structure (bamboo, wood, nails, tools)
- Samples of processed mountain products (coffee, spices, dried fruits)
- Laptops/tablets for marketing plan development

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify proper harvesting and storage methods for mountain crops
- Explain techniques to reduce post-harvest losses
- Describe small-scale processing options for mountain products
- Develop a basic marketing plan for a local mountain product

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Students brainstorm in small groups about post-harvest challenges they've observed or experienced with mountain crops. Groups share their top 3 challenges with the class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Post-harvest losses
- Value addition
- Processing
- Storage structures
- Marketing strategies
- Supply chain

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Proper Harvesting Methods
- Timing of harvest for different crops
- Handling techniques to minimize damage

### Storage Methods
- Traditional vs. improved storage structures
- Temperature and humidity control
- Pest management in storage

### Reducing Post-Harvest Losses
- Causes of losses (physical damage, pests, decay)
- Strategies for loss reduction at different stages

### Small-Scale Processing Options
- Drying (solar drying techniques)
- Fermentation (e.g. coffee processing)
- Grinding and packaging (e.g. spices)

### Marketing Strategies for Mountain Products
- Identifying unique selling points
- Packaging and branding
- Direct marketing vs. intermediaries
- Potential for organic/fair trade certification

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. In pairs, students design a small storage structure suitable for a specific mountain crop, considering local materials and climate.

2. Groups of 3-4 students brainstorm value-addition ideas for a common mountain crop (e.g. coffee, cassava, taro). They present their top idea to the class.

## 7. Production Task (60 minutes)

Students work in small groups to develop a basic marketing plan for a local mountain product of their choice. The plan should include:
- Product description and unique qualities
- Target market
- Pricing strategy
- Distribution channels
- Promotion ideas

Groups present their plans to the class for feedback.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points on post-harvest handling and value addition
- Address any remaining questions
- Students share one new thing they learned and how they might apply it

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students interview a local mountain farmer or processor about their post-harvest practices and challenges. They should prepare a short report on their findings and suggestions for improvements based on what they've learned in class.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Post-harvest losses: Reduction in quantity or quality of crops that occurs after harvesting
- Value addition: Process of increasing the economic value of a product through processing, packaging, or marketing
- Processing: Transforming raw agricultural products into a different form (e.g. drying, fermenting)
- Storage structures: Facilities used to store harvested crops to maintain quality and reduce losses
- Marketing strategies: Plans and methods used to promote and sell products
- Supply chain: The network of people, organizations, and activities involved in moving a product from producer to consumer
