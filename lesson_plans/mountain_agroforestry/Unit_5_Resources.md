## Case Study: Ataúro Island Coffee Cooperative

Ataúro Island, located off the coast of Dili, has a small but growing coffee industry. In 2018, a group of farmers formed the Ataúro Coffee Cooperative to improve post-harvest handling and marketing of their coffee. 

Key initiatives:
- Construction of a central processing facility
- Implementation of quality control measures
- Development of a unique "Ataúro Island Coffee" brand
- Direct marketing to specialty coffee shops in Dili

Results:
- 30% reduction in post-harvest losses
- 50% increase in price received for green coffee beans
- Establishment of long-term relationships with buyers

Discussion points:
- Factors contributing to the cooperative's success
- Challenges faced and how they were overcome
- Potential for replicating this model in other mountain regions of Timor-Leste
