# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Mushroom Biodiversity in Timor-Leste

## Resources Needed

- Field guides of local mushroom species
- Magnifying glasses or hand lenses
- Collection containers (baskets, paper bags)
- Notebooks and pencils
- Digital camera or smartphone
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Specimens of common local mushrooms (fresh or preserved)

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify at least 5 common mushroom species found in Timor-Leste
2. Explain the basic structure and life cycle of mushrooms
3. Describe 3 ecological roles of mushrooms in tropical forest ecosystems
4. Use proper techniques for mushroom identification and collection

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display a variety of local mushroom specimens (or high-quality photos)
- Ask students to share any knowledge they have about these mushrooms:
  * Local names
  * Where they've seen them growing
  * Whether they are edible or used traditionally

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  * Mycelium
  * Fruiting body
  * Spore
  * Saprophyte
  * Mycorrhizal
  * Biodiversity
- Use visual aids and simple diagrams to illustrate these concepts

## Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Overview of mushroom biology:
   - Basic structure (mycelium, fruiting body)
   - Life cycle and reproduction
   - Nutritional strategies (saprophytic, mycorrhizal, parasitic)

2. Mushroom diversity in Timor-Leste:
   - Estimated number of species
   - Common native species and their habitats
   - Introduced species and their impact

3. Ecological roles of mushrooms:
   - Decomposition and nutrient cycling
   - Symbiotic relationships with plants
   - Food source for wildlife
   - Soil formation and water retention

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Mushroom Identification Exercise:
   - Divide students into small groups
   - Provide each group with 3-5 mushroom specimens or high-quality photos
   - Using field guides, students attempt to identify the species
   - Groups share their findings and reasoning with the class

2. Ecological Role Matching Game:
   - Create cards with mushroom species and ecological roles
   - Students match mushrooms to their primary ecological functions
   - Discuss the matches as a class, explaining the connections

## Production Task (20 minutes)

- Students create a simple field guide page for one local mushroom species:
  * Scientific and local name
  * Sketch or photo of the mushroom
  * Key identifying features
  * Habitat and ecological role
  * Any traditional uses or interesting facts

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Show photos of mushrooms and ask students to identify them
- Recap the main points of the lesson:
  * Mushroom diversity in Timor-Leste
  * Basic mushroom biology
  * Ecological importance of mushrooms

## Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a one-page report on a traditional use of mushrooms in Timorese culture
2. Find and photograph (or sketch) two different mushroom species in your local area, noting the habitat where they were found

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Mycelium: The vegetative part of a fungus, consisting of a network of fine white filaments
- Fruiting body: The spore-producing structure of a fungus, typically the part we recognize as a mushroom
- Spore: A reproductive unit of fungi, capable of growing into a new organism
- Saprophyte: An organism that feeds on dead organic matter
- Mycorrhizal: Describing a symbiotic association between a fungus and a plant root
- Biodiversity: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
