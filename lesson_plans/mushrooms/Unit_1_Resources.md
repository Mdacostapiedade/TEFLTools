# Lecture Notes

## Overview of Mushroom Biology and Taxonomy

### Basic Structure
- Mycelium: Underground network of thread-like hyphae
- Fruiting body: Above-ground structure (mushroom)
  * Cap (pileus)
  * Gills (lamellae) or pores
  * Stem (stipe)
  * Veil (velum) - in some species
  * Ring (annulus) - remnant of veil in some species

### Life Cycle
1. Spore germination
2. Mycelium growth
3. Fruiting body formation
4. Spore production and release

### Taxonomy
- Kingdom: Fungi
- Major mushroom phyla:
  * Basidiomycota (most common edible mushrooms)
  * Ascomycota (morels, truffles)
- Important families in Timor-Leste:
  * Agaricaceae (button mushrooms, parasol mushrooms)
  * Polyporaceae (bracket fungi)
  * Boletaceae (porcini and related species)

## Native and Introduced Mushroom Species in Timor-Leste

### Native Species
1. Schizophyllum commune (Split-gill fungus)
   - Habitat: Dead wood in forests
   - Characteristics: Fan-shaped, gills split lengthwise
2. Auricularia auricula-judae (Wood ear fungus)
   - Habitat: Dead or dying elder trees
   - Characteristics: Ear-shaped, gelatinous texture
3. Lentinus sajor-caju (Pink oyster mushroom)
   - Habitat: Dead hardwood trees
   - Characteristics: Pink to brown cap, decurrent gills

### Introduced Species
1. Agaricus bisporus (Button mushroom)
   - Introduced for cultivation
   - Now found in some agricultural areas
2. Pleurotus ostreatus (Oyster mushroom)
   - Introduced for cultivation
   - Occasionally found on dead wood in disturbed areas

## Ecological Functions of Mushrooms in Tropical Forests

### Decomposition and Nutrient Cycling
- Break down dead plant material
- Release nutrients back into the soil
- Example: Ganoderma species decomposing fallen logs

### Mycorrhizal Associations
- Form symbiotic relationships with plant roots
- Enhance nutrient and water uptake for plants
- Example: Boletus species associating with Dipterocarp trees

### Soil Formation and Stabilization
- Mycelium binds soil particles
- Improves soil structure and water retention
- Example: Mycelium networks in forest floor litter

### Food Web Interactions
- Provide food for insects, mammals, and birds
- Support biodiversity in forest ecosystems
- Example: Termites cultivating Termitomyces fungi

# Discussion Questions

1. How might climate change affect mushroom biodiversity in Timor-Leste's forests?
2. What are the potential ecological consequences of introducing non-native mushroom species for cultivation?
3. How can traditional ecological knowledge about mushrooms be integrated with scientific research in Timor-Leste?
4. Discuss the potential role of mushrooms in reforestation efforts in Timor-Leste.
5. How might increased mushroom cultivation impact local forest ecosystems, both positively and negatively?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Mushroom Ecosystem Services Essay

Write a 500-word essay on the ecosystem services provided by mushrooms in Timor-Leste's forests. Include the following points:

1. Introduction: Brief overview of mushroom diversity in Timor-Leste
2. Decomposition: Explain how mushrooms break down organic matter and why this is important
3. Nutrient cycling: Describe how mushrooms contribute to nutrient availability for other organisms
4. Mycorrhizal associations: Discuss the benefits of these symbiotic relationships for forest health
5. Biodiversity support: Explain how mushrooms contribute to overall forest biodiversity
6. Conclusion: Summarize the importance of mushrooms for forest ecosystem functioning

Use specific examples of mushroom species found in Timor-Leste where possible. Cite at least three scientific sources to support your points.

# Assignment Details

## Visual Guide of Common Timorese Mushrooms

Create a visual guide featuring 10 common mushroom species found in Timor-Leste. For each species, include:

1. Scientific name and common name (if available)
2. High-quality photograph or detailed illustration
3. Key identifying features (cap shape, gill structure, stem characteristics)
4. Habitat and substrate preferences
5. Ecological role (decomposer, mycorrhizal, etc.)
6. Any traditional uses or cultural significance
7. Edibility status (edible, inedible, or poisonous)

Format the guide as a poster or digital presentation. Include a brief introduction about mushroom diversity in Timor-Leste and a glossary of key mycological terms.

# Additional Materials

## Field Trip Checklist

- Proper attire (long pants, closed-toe shoes)
- Field guides and identification keys
- Collection baskets or paper bags
- Notebook and pencil
- Camera
- GPS device or smartphone with GPS capabilities
- Hand lens or magnifying glass
- Knife or trowel for collecting specimens
- Wax paper or aluminum foil for wrapping delicate specimens
- First aid kit
- Water and snacks

## Mushroom Collection and Identification Tips

1. Photograph the mushroom in its natural habitat before collecting
2. Collect the entire fruiting body, including the base
3. Note the substrate and surrounding plants
4. Record the date, location, and habitat details
5. Use multiple senses for identification (appearance, smell, texture)
6. Examine the cap, gills/pores, stem, and any special features
7. Make a spore print for further identification
8. Use dichotomous keys and field guides for identification
9. Consult experts for confirmation of rare or difficult species

## Sample Spore Print Instructions

1. Remove the cap from the stem
2. Place the cap gill-side down on a piece of white and dark paper
3. Cover with a bowl to prevent air currents
4. Leave for 4-24 hours
5. Remove the cap to reveal the spore print
6. Note the color and pattern of the spores
