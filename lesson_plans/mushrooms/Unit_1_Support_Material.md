Here's the support material for the lesson plan on "Introduction to Mushroom Biodiversity in Timor-Leste," formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Mushroom Biodiversity Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Mycelium**: The vegetative part of a fungus, consisting of a network of fine white filaments
- **Fruiting body**: The spore-producing structure of a fungus, typically the part we recognize as a mushroom
- **Spore**: A reproductive unit of fungi, capable of growing into a new organism
- **Saprophyte**: An organism that feeds on dead organic matter
- **Mycorrhizal**: Describing a symbiotic association between a fungus and a plant root
- **Biodiversity**: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
- **Hyphae**: The thread-like filaments that make up the mycelium
- **Gills**: The thin, blade-like structures under the cap of many mushrooms where spores are produced
- **Substrate**: The material on which a fungus grows and obtains nutrients

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Mushroom Anatomy Diagram:
   - Sketch showing the main parts of a mushroom: cap, gills, stem, ring, volva, and mycelium
   - Labels for each part with brief descriptions

2. Mushroom Life Cycle Illustration:
   - Circular diagram showing: spore → germination → mycelium growth → primordia formation → fruiting body development → spore release

3. Ecological Roles of Mushrooms Infographic:
   - Visual representation of:
     * Decomposers breaking down dead wood
     * Mycorrhizal fungi connected to tree roots
     * Mushrooms as food for wildlife
     * Mushrooms improving soil structure

4. Common Mushroom Species of Timor-Leste Poster:
   - Photos or illustrations of 5-10 common local mushroom species with names and key features

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Mushroom Identification Practice Sheet:
   - Images of 5 local mushroom species
   - Blank spaces for students to fill in:
     * Species name
     * Key identifying features
     * Ecological role
     * Edibility (if known)

2. Ecological Role Matching Worksheet:
   - Two columns: one with mushroom species, another with ecological roles
   - Students draw lines to match species with their primary roles

3. Field Guide Page Template:
   - Structured template for students to create their own field guide entry, including spaces for:
     * Scientific and local name
     * Sketch or photo
     * Key identifying features
     * Habitat and ecological role
     * Traditional uses or interesting facts

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Online Resources:
   - Mushroom Observer (https://mushroomobserver.org/): For identifying and learning about fungi
   - iNaturalist (https://www.inaturalist.org/): Citizen science platform for biodiversity observations

2. Books:
   - "Mushrooms of Southeast Asia" by Susan Metzler and Van Cruysen
   - "Tropical Mushrooms: Biological Nature and Cultivation Methods" edited by S.T. Chang and T.H. Quimio

3. Scientific Papers:
   - "Diversity of Macrofungi and Their Potential Use in Timor-Leste" (if available)
   - "Edible Mushrooms of Tropical Southeast Asia" by E.J.H. Corner

4. Local Resources:
   - Herbarium collections at national universities or research institutions in Timor-Leste
   - Traditional knowledge repositories or databases of local ecological knowledge

## 5. Tips for Teachers

1. Potential Challenges and Solutions:
   - Limited local field guides: Create a collaborative class project to develop a basic guide
   - Lack of fresh specimens: Use high-quality photos or preserved specimens when necessary
   - Cultural taboos around mushrooms: Address misconceptions respectfully and emphasize scientific knowledge

2. Safety Considerations:
   - Emphasize the importance of never eating wild mushrooms without expert identification
   - Teach proper hygiene when handling mushrooms and substrates

3. Engagement Strategies:
   - Incorporate local traditional knowledge about mushrooms to increase relevance
   - Use hands-on activities and outdoor exploration to maintain interest
   - Encourage students to start their own mushroom observation journals

4. Adaptations for Different Levels:
   - For younger students: Focus more on basic identification and ecological roles
   - For advanced students: Introduce concepts of fungal taxonomy and biochemistry

5. Cross-curricular Connections:
   - Link to biology (ecology, plant-fungal interactions)
   - Connect to chemistry (decomposition processes, nutrient cycling)
   - Integrate with local culture and history (traditional uses of mushrooms)
