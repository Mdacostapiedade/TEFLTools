# Lesson Plan: Nutritional and Medicinal Properties of Edible Mushrooms

## Resources Needed

- Samples of common edible mushrooms found in Timor-Leste
- Nutritional analysis equipment (if available) or nutritional data sheets
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on mushroom nutritional content
- Interview guidelines for elder interviews
- Notebooks and writing materials for students

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify the key nutritional components of common edible mushrooms
2. Compare the nutritional value of different mushroom species
3. Explain at least three traditional medicinal uses of mushrooms in Timor-Leste
4. Describe the main bioactive compounds found in medicinal mushrooms

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display various edible mushroom samples
- Ask students to guess which mushroom they think is the most nutritious and why
- Discuss their responses and introduce the topic of mushroom nutrition

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Macronutrients
- Micronutrients
- Bioactive compounds
- Antioxidants
- Polysaccharides
- Beta-glucans

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Nutritional composition of edible mushrooms
   - Protein content and amino acid profile
   - Carbohydrates and dietary fiber
   - Fat content and types
   - Vitamins and minerals

2. Bioactive compounds in medicinal mushrooms
   - Polysaccharides (e.g., beta-glucans)
   - Terpenoids
   - Phenolic compounds
   - Lectins

3. Overview of traditional Timorese knowledge of mushroom uses
   - Common medicinal mushrooms used in Timor-Leste
   - Traditional preparation methods
   - Reported health benefits

## Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Nutritional Analysis Lab (30 minutes)
   - Divide students into groups
   - Provide each group with nutritional data for different local mushroom species
   - Have students create comparative charts or graphs of nutritional content
   - Groups present their findings to the class

2. Traditional Use Brainstorming (15 minutes)
   - In pairs, students brainstorm questions to ask elders about traditional mushroom uses
   - Share and compile a class list of interview questions

## Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Role-play interviews in pairs, practicing asking questions about traditional mushroom uses
2. Create a preliminary outline for their elder interviews, including key points to cover

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap the main nutritional benefits of mushrooms
- Discuss the importance of preserving traditional knowledge
- Address any questions or misconceptions

## Homework Assignment

1. Conduct an interview with a local elder about traditional mushroom uses in medicine and cuisine
2. Write a 1-2 page report summarizing the interview findings, including:
   - At least three traditional medicinal uses of mushrooms
   - Any preparation methods mentioned
   - Comparisons between traditional knowledge and scientific understanding of mushroom benefits

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Macronutrients: Nutrients required in large amounts by the body (proteins, carbohydrates, fats)
- Micronutrients: Nutrients required in smaller amounts (vitamins, minerals)
- Bioactive compounds: Chemicals in foods that have actions in the body that may promote good health
- Antioxidants: Substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells caused by free radicals
- Polysaccharides: Complex carbohydrates made up of multiple sugar molecules bonded together
- Beta-glucans: A type of fiber found in mushrooms that may have immune-boosting properties
