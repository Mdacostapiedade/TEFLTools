# Support Material for Lesson on Nutritional and Medicinal Properties of Edible Mushrooms

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Macronutrients**: Nutrients required in large amounts by the body (proteins, carbohydrates, fats)
- **Micronutrients**: Nutrients required in smaller amounts (vitamins, minerals)
- **Bioactive compounds**: Chemicals in foods that have actions in the body that may promote good health
- **Antioxidants**: Substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells caused by free radicals
- **Polysaccharides**: Complex carbohydrates made up of multiple sugar molecules bonded together
- **Beta-glucans**: A type of fiber found in mushrooms that may have immune-boosting properties
- **Terpenoids**: A large class of organic compounds produced by plants and fungi, some of which have medicinal properties
- **Phenolic compounds**: A class of chemical compounds consisting of a hydroxyl group bonded directly to an aromatic hydrocarbon group, often with antioxidant properties
- **Lectins**: Proteins that bind to specific carbohydrates and have various biological functions

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. Nutritional Composition Pie Chart:
   - Create a pie chart showing the average nutritional composition of edible mushrooms, including percentages for protein, carbohydrates, fat, fiber, and water content.

2. Bioactive Compounds Infographic:
   - Design an infographic illustrating the main bioactive compounds found in medicinal mushrooms, with simple icons representing polysaccharides, terpenoids, phenolic compounds, and lectins.

3. Traditional vs. Modern Use Comparison Table:
   - Create a table comparing traditional Timorese uses of medicinal mushrooms with their scientifically studied benefits, including columns for mushroom species, traditional use, and corresponding scientific evidence.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. Nutritional Analysis Worksheet:
   - Provide a table with blank cells for students to fill in nutritional data for different local mushroom species.
   - Include columns for protein, carbohydrates, fat, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
   - Add a section for students to calculate and compare the nutritional density of each species.

2. Elder Interview Guide:
   - Create a structured interview guide with prompts for students to use when interviewing elders about traditional mushroom uses.
   - Include sections for medicinal uses, preparation methods, and cultural significance.
   - Provide space for students to record responses and make notes.

3. Mushroom Benefits Summary Sheet:
   - Develop a one-page summary of the key nutritional and medicinal benefits of common edible mushrooms in Timor-Leste.
   - Include a brief overview of important bioactive compounds and their potential health effects.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Scientific Articles:
   - "Nutritional value and medicinal benefits of mushrooms" by S. P. Wasser (International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms)
   - "Medicinal mushrooms: Ancient remedies meet modern science" by P. Stamets (Integrative Medicine: A Clinician's Journal)

2. Online Resources:
   - Mushroom Cultivation and Uses Database: [mushworld.com](http://www.mushworld.com)
   - Medicinal Mushroom Information Center: [medicalmushrooms.net](http://www.medicalmushrooms.net)

3. Local Resources:
   - "Traditional Medicinal Plants of Timor-Leste" by Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (if available)
   - Local herbarium or botanical garden with mushroom specimens

4. Practice Activities:
   - Virtual mushroom identification quiz using local species
   - Online nutritional analysis tool for comparing mushroom species

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Limited access to fresh mushroom samples:
   - Use high-quality photographs or preserved specimens when fresh samples are unavailable.
   - Encourage students to bring in any mushrooms they find locally, ensuring proper safety precautions.

2. Lack of nutritional analysis equipment:
   - Provide pre-compiled nutritional data sheets for common local mushrooms.
   - Use online databases or smartphone apps for nutritional information when possible.

3. Cultural sensitivity around traditional knowledge:
   - Discuss the importance of respecting traditional knowledge and obtaining proper consent before interviews.
   - Provide guidelines on ethical data collection and representation of traditional practices.

4. Misconceptions about mushroom safety:
   - Emphasize the importance of proper identification and never consuming wild mushrooms without expert verification.
   - Discuss the difference between edible, medicinal, and poisonous mushrooms.

5. Limited scientific resources in local language:
   - Prepare simplified summaries of key scientific concepts in the local language.
   - Use visual aids and hands-on activities to overcome language barriers in understanding complex topics.

6. Bridging traditional knowledge and scientific understanding:
   - Encourage open discussions about how traditional practices align with or differ from scientific findings.
   - Highlight the value of both traditional wisdom and modern research in understanding mushroom benefits.
