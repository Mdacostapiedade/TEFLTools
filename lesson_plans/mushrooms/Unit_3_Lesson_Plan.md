# Lesson Plan: Sustainable Cultivation Techniques

## Resources Needed

- Samples of local substrate materials (coffee husks, coconut coir, sawdust)
- Mushroom spawn (preferably oyster mushroom)
- Plastic bags for substrate
- Pressure cooker or large pot for sterilization
- Thermometer
- pH testing strips
- Microscope and slides (if available)
- Handouts on cultivation methods and substrate recipes
- Projector and computer for presentations

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify at least three local materials suitable for mushroom substrate
2. Explain the basic steps of substrate preparation and sterilization
3. Demonstrate proper inoculation techniques
4. Set up a small-scale mushroom cultivation experiment

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

1. Display various local agricultural waste materials
2. Ask students to brainstorm potential uses for these materials
3. Introduce the concept of upcycling waste for mushroom cultivation

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

1. Write key terms on the board: substrate, spawn, inoculation, mycelium
2. Provide simple definitions and examples for each term
3. Have students create visual representations or mnemonic devices for each term

## Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

1. Overview of mushroom cultivation methods suitable for Timor-Leste
   - Log cultivation
   - Bag cultivation
   - Indoor shelf cultivation

2. Substrate preparation using local materials
   - Coffee husks
   - Coconut coir
   - Sawdust
   - Supplementation with rice bran or other nutrients

3. Sterilization techniques
   - Pressure cooking
   - Steam pasteurization
   - Cold water lime bath method

4. Spawn production and inoculation techniques
   - Types of spawn (grain, sawdust)
   - Proper handling and storage of spawn
   - Inoculation methods for different cultivation techniques

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Divide students into small groups
2. Each group prepares a small batch of substrate using different local materials
3. Students measure and adjust moisture content and pH of their substrate
4. Groups practice proper sterilization techniques (simulated if equipment is limited)

## Production Task (45 minutes)

1. Demonstrate proper inoculation technique
2. Students inoculate their prepared substrates with mushroom spawn
3. Set up small-scale cultivation experiments using different methods (bags, trays, etc.)
4. Label experiments and create data collection sheets for monitoring growth

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

1. Quick quiz on key steps of mushroom cultivation
2. Group discussion on potential challenges and solutions in local production
3. Recap of the importance of using sustainable, locally available materials

## Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a one-page report on a mushroom species suitable for cultivation in Timor-Leste, including its preferred substrate and growing conditions
2. Begin daily observations of cultivation experiments, recording data on growth, temperature, and humidity

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Substrate: The material on which mushroom mycelium grows
- Spawn: Mushroom mycelium grown on a carrier material, used to inoculate substrates
- Inoculation: The process of introducing mushroom spawn into a prepared substrate
- Mycelium: The vegetative part of a fungus, consisting of a network of fine white filaments
- Pasteurization: A heat treatment process used to reduce harmful microorganisms in substrate
- Fruiting: The stage when mushrooms develop from the mycelium
- Colonization: The process of mycelium growing throughout the substrate
