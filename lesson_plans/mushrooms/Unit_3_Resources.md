## Low-tech Cultivation Methods

### Log Cultivation
- Suitable for wood-loving species like shiitake and oyster mushrooms
- Uses freshly cut hardwood logs, 3-4 inches in diameter
- Inoculation methods:
  * Plug spawn: Drill holes and insert wooden dowels colonized with mycelium
  * Sawdust spawn: Fill drilled holes with sawdust-based spawn
- Incubation period: 6-18 months depending on species and log size
- Fruiting triggered by soaking logs in cold water

### Bag Cultivation
- Versatile method suitable for various species
- Uses plastic bags filled with sterilized substrate
- Common substrates: sawdust, straw, coffee grounds, or combinations
- Inoculation done by mixing spawn throughout substrate
- Incubation in dark, warm area until fully colonized
- Fruiting initiated by cutting small holes in the bag and exposing to light

### Indoor Shelf Cultivation
- Controlled environment for year-round production
- Uses shelving units with multiple levels
- Substrate contained in bags or trays on shelves
- Temperature, humidity, and light controlled for optimal growth
- Allows for higher density production in limited space

## Substrate Materials in Timor-Leste

### Coffee Husks
- Abundant agricultural waste from coffee processing
- High in cellulose and lignin, suitable for many mushroom species
- Often mixed with other materials for optimal nutrition
- pH adjustment may be necessary (coffee husks are slightly acidic)

### Coconut Coir
- Fibrous material from coconut husks
- Excellent water retention properties
- Often used as a base material, mixed with more nutritious supplements
- Requires thorough washing to remove salts before use

### Sawdust
- Byproduct from local timber industry
- Ideal for wood-loving species like shiitake and oyster mushrooms
- Should be from hardwood species, avoid treated or painted wood
- Often supplemented with bran or other nutrients for faster growth

### Supplementation
- Rice bran: adds nitrogen and other nutrients
- Gypsum: improves substrate structure and provides calcium
- Lime: adjusts pH and provides calcium
- Local agricultural wastes: corn cobs, sugarcane bagasse, etc.

## Spawn Production and Inoculation Techniques

### Types of Spawn
- Grain spawn:
  * Made with wheat, rye, or millet
  * High in nutrition, fast-colonizing
  * Used for inoculating bulk substrates
- Sawdust spawn:
  * Made with hardwood sawdust and supplements
  * Used for log cultivation and some bag methods
  * Slower colonization but longer shelf life

### Spawn Production Process
1. Prepare substrate (grain or sawdust)
2. Sterilize substrate in jars or bags
3. Inoculate with pure mushroom culture
4. Incubate until fully colonized
5. Use to inoculate production substrates

### Inoculation Techniques
- Mixing: For bag and indoor cultivation, mix spawn throughout substrate
- Layer method: Alternate layers of substrate and spawn in bags or containers
- Topping: Place a layer of spawn on top of the substrate (for some species)
- Insertion: For log cultivation, insert spawn plugs into drilled holes

### Best Practices
- Work in a clean environment to prevent contamination
- Use fully colonized spawn for best results
- Distribute spawn evenly throughout substrate
- Maintain proper moisture levels during inoculation
- Seal inoculated substrates to prevent contamination during incubation

# Discussion Questions

1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each cultivation method (log, bag, and indoor) in the context of Timor-Leste?

2. How can we optimize the use of coffee husks, a prevalent agricultural waste in Timor-Leste, for mushroom cultivation?

3. What challenges might small-scale farmers face when implementing these cultivation techniques, and how can they be addressed?

4. How does the choice of substrate material affect the nutritional content and flavor of cultivated mushrooms?

5. In what ways can mushroom cultivation contribute to sustainable agriculture and waste management in Timor-Leste?

6. What are the potential economic impacts of introducing widespread mushroom cultivation in rural communities?

7. How might traditional knowledge of wild mushrooms in Timor-Leste be integrated into modern cultivation practices?

8. What are the key factors to consider when selecting mushroom species for cultivation in Timor-Leste's climate?

4. Conclude with a brief discussion on how this system could benefit the village economically and environmentally.

# Assignment Details

## Small-Scale Mushroom Cultivation Experiment

Objective: Set up and monitor a small-scale mushroom cultivation experiment using locally available materials.

Instructions:
1. Form groups of 3-4 students.
2. Each group will set up two different cultivation methods:
   a) Bag cultivation
   b) Indoor shelf cultivation or log cultivation (choose one)
3. For each method, use a different locally available substrate material.
4. Prepare and inoculate your substrates as demonstrated in class.
5. Set up your cultivation experiments in the designated area.
6. Create a monitoring schedule and data collection sheet.
7. Over the next 4 weeks, record daily observations including:
   - Temperature and humidity
   - Mycelial growth progress
   - Any signs of contamination
   - Pinning and fruiting body development
8. Take photos to document the growth process.
9. At the end of the 4-week period, prepare a report including:
