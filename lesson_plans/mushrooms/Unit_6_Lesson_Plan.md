# Lesson Plan: Quality Control and Post-Harvest Handling

## Resources Needed

- Fresh mushrooms of various species
- Harvesting tools (knives, scissors, baskets)
- Packaging materials (paper bags, plastic containers)
- Refrigerator or cool storage area
- Thermometer and hygrometer
- Cleaning supplies
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on food safety guidelines
- Sample quality control checklists

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Demonstrate proper harvesting techniques for different mushroom species
2. Explain optimal post-harvest handling and storage methods
3. Identify key food safety considerations in mushroom production
4. Create a basic quality control checklist for small-scale mushroom producers

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Mushroom Handling Brainstorm:
- Divide students into small groups
- Ask each group to list potential issues that could arise when handling fresh mushrooms
- Have groups share their ideas and compile a class list on the whiteboard

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Post-harvest handling
- Shelf life
- Contamination
- Food safety
- Quality control
- Cold chain

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Optimal Harvesting Techniques
   - Timing of harvest for different species
   - Proper cutting or twisting methods
   - Avoiding damage to fruiting bodies and substrate

2. Post-harvest Handling and Storage
   - Immediate cooling methods
   - Proper packaging materials and techniques
   - Temperature and humidity control
   - Shelf life expectations for different species

3. Food Safety Considerations
   - Potential contaminants in mushroom production
   - Personal hygiene for handlers
   - Cleaning and sanitizing equipment and surfaces
   - Proper labeling and traceability

4. Quality Control Measures
   - Visual inspection criteria
   - Grading standards
   - Record-keeping practices
   - Continuous improvement processes

## Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Harvesting Demonstration and Practice (20 minutes)
   - Demonstrate proper harvesting techniques for 2-3 mushroom species
   - Have students practice harvesting in small groups, rotating through different species

2. Packaging and Storage Simulation (25 minutes)
   - Set up stations with different packaging materials and storage conditions
   - Have students package mushrooms and decide on optimal storage methods
   - Discuss the pros and cons of each method as a class

## Production Task (30 minutes)

Quality Control Checklist Development:
- Divide students into small groups
- Each group creates a quality control checklist for small-scale mushroom producers
- Checklists should include harvesting, handling, storage, and food safety considerations
- Groups present their checklists to the class for feedback

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

1. Key Points Review:
   - Ask students to share one important thing they learned about each main topic
   - Clarify any misunderstandings or questions

2. Real-world Application Discussion:
   - How can these practices be implemented in Timor-Leste?
   - What challenges might local producers face in maintaining quality control?

## Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a 1-page report on a food safety issue related to mushroom production and how it can be prevented.

2. Create a simple infographic or poster highlighting 5 key post-harvest handling tips for mushroom growers in Timor-Leste.

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

1. Post-harvest handling: The stage of crop production immediately following harvest, including cooling, cleaning, sorting and packing.

2. Shelf life: The length of time that a commodity may be stored without becoming unfit for use, consumption, or sale.

3. Contamination: The presence of an unwanted organism, substance, or material in food that can cause illness or reduce quality.

4. Food safety: Handling, preparing and storing food in ways that prevent foodborne illness.

5. Quality control: A system of maintaining standards in manufactured products by testing a sample of the output against the specification.

6. Cold chain: A temperature-controlled supply chain used to maintain quality and safety of perishable products.
