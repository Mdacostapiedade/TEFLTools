# Lecture Notes

## Optimal Harvesting Techniques

### Timing of Harvest
- Different species have different optimal harvest times
- Oyster mushrooms: harvest when cap edges begin to flatten out
- Shiitake: harvest when caps are 50-70% open
- Button mushrooms: harvest when caps are closed or slightly open

### Proper Cutting or Twisting Methods
- Use a sharp, clean knife for most species
- Cut at the base, close to the substrate
- For some species like oyster mushrooms, twisting and pulling can be effective
- Avoid damaging the substrate or nearby mushrooms

### Avoiding Damage
- Handle mushrooms gently to prevent bruising
- Use clean hands or gloves
- Place harvested mushrooms in clean containers
- Avoid overfilling containers to prevent crushing

## Post-harvest Handling and Storage

### Immediate Cooling Methods
- Cool mushrooms to 2-4°C within 1 hour of harvest
- Use forced-air cooling or hydro-cooling methods
- Avoid direct contact with ice

### Proper Packaging Materials and Techniques
- Use breathable packaging (e.g., perforated plastic bags, paper bags)
- Avoid airtight containers that trap moisture
- Package similar sizes and qualities together

### Temperature and Humidity Control
- Maintain storage temperature at 1-4°C
- Keep relative humidity between 90-95%
- Use hygrometers to monitor humidity levels

### Shelf Life Expectations
- Button mushrooms: 7-10 days
- Oyster mushrooms: 5-7 days
- Shiitake: 10-14 days
- Factors affecting shelf life: temperature, humidity, handling, packaging

## Food Safety Considerations

### Potential Contaminants
- Bacterial pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli)
- Fungal contaminants (e.g., molds)
- Chemical residues from substrate or cleaning agents

### Personal Hygiene for Handlers
- Proper handwashing techniques
- Use of clean clothing and hair coverings
- Avoiding handling when ill

### Cleaning and Sanitizing
- Regular cleaning schedule for all equipment and surfaces
- Use food-grade sanitizers
- Proper dilution and application of cleaning agents

### Proper Labeling and Traceability
- Include harvest date, species, and producer information
- Implement lot numbering system
- Maintain records of sales and distribution

## Quality Control Measures

### Visual Inspection Criteria
- Size and shape uniformity
- Color and texture
- Absence of blemishes or damage
- Cleanliness

### Grading Standards
- Develop clear grading criteria (e.g., premium, standard, processing grade)
- Train staff in grading procedures
- Consistent application of standards

### Record-keeping Practices
- Document harvest dates, quantities, and quality assessments
- Track storage conditions and durations
- Monitor customer feedback and complaints

### Continuous Improvement Processes
- Regular review of quality control data
- Staff training and updates on best practices
- Incorporation of new research and technologies

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Quality Control Case Study Analysis

1. Read the following case study:

   "A small mushroom cooperative in Timor-Leste has been experiencing issues with product quality. Customers have reported receiving mushrooms that are bruised, have an off-odor, or spoil quickly. The cooperative wants to improve its quality control measures but has limited resources."

2. Write a 500-word analysis addressing the following points:
   - Identify potential causes of the quality issues
   - Suggest three specific quality control measures the cooperative could implement
   - Discuss how these measures could be implemented with limited resources
   - Explain the potential impact of these measures on the cooperative's business

3. Use the concepts learned in class to support your analysis.

4. Include a brief conclusion summarizing your recommendations.
