# Support Material for Quality Control and Post-Harvest Handling Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

1. Post-harvest handling: The stage of crop production immediately following harvest, including cooling, cleaning, sorting and packing.
2. Shelf life: The length of time that a commodity may be stored without becoming unfit for use, consumption, or sale.
3. Contamination: The presence of an unwanted organism, substance, or material in food that can cause illness or reduce quality.
4. Food safety: Handling, preparing and storing food in ways that prevent foodborne illness.
5. Quality control: A system of maintaining standards in manufactured products by testing a sample of the output against the specification.
6. Cold chain: A temperature-controlled supply chain used to maintain quality and safety of perishable products.
7. Traceability: The ability to track any food through all stages of production, processing and distribution.
8. Grading: The process of sorting harvested mushrooms into different quality categories based on size, shape, and appearance.
9. Sanitization: The process of reducing the number of microorganisms on a surface to safe levels.
10. Fruiting body: The spore-producing structure of a fungus, commonly referred to as the mushroom.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Mushroom Harvesting Techniques Diagram:
   - A series of illustrations showing proper cutting and twisting methods for different mushroom species.
   - Include visual cues for ideal harvest times (e.g., cap opening stages).

2. Post-Harvest Handling Flowchart:
   - A flowchart depicting the steps from harvest to storage:
     Harvest → Cleaning → Sorting → Packaging → Cooling → Storage

3. Temperature and Humidity Control Chart:
   - A graph showing optimal temperature and humidity ranges for different mushroom species during storage.

4. Quality Control Checklist Infographic:
   - A visual representation of key quality control points, including harvesting, handling, storage, and food safety considerations.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Mushroom Species Harvest Guide:
   - A table with columns for mushroom species, optimal harvest indicators, and specific handling notes.

2. Post-Harvest Handling Checklist:
   - A step-by-step checklist for students to use during the packaging and storage simulation activity.

3. Food Safety Guidelines for Mushroom Production:
   - A comprehensive list of food safety practices specific to mushroom cultivation and handling.

4. Quality Control Checklist Template:
   - A blank template for students to use when creating their own quality control checklists during the production task.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

5. Video series: "Quality Control in Mushroom Production" by Mushroom Mountain on YouTube.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited access to fresh mushrooms of various species.
   Solution: Prepare in advance by coordinating with local growers or consider using high-quality photographs and video demonstrations as alternatives.

2. Challenge: Students unfamiliar with handling fresh mushrooms.
   Solution: Begin with a demonstration and allow ample practice time. Emphasize the importance of gentle handling.

3. Challenge: Difficulty maintaining optimal storage conditions in the classroom.
   Solution: Use insulated containers and ice packs to simulate proper cooling. If possible, arrange access to a refrigerator for the storage activity.

4. Challenge: Students struggling to create comprehensive quality control checklists.
   Solution: Provide a basic template and encourage group collaboration. Review industry standards beforehand to guide students.

5. Challenge: Addressing food safety concerns in a classroom setting.
   Solution: Emphasize proper hand washing and use of gloves. If handling fresh mushrooms, ensure they are from a reputable source and properly cleaned before class use.

6. Challenge: Adapting the lesson to local context in Timor-Leste.
   Solution: Research local mushroom species and production practices beforehand. Invite a local mushroom grower as a guest speaker if possible.
