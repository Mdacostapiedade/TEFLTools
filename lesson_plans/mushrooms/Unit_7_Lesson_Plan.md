# Lesson Plan: Applications of Mushrooms in Food, Pharmaceuticals, and Ecosystem Restoration

## 1. Resources Needed

- Cooking equipment (stoves, pots, pans, utensils)
- Local mushroom species (fresh and dried)
- Ingredients for cooking demonstration
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on mycoremediation techniques
- Maps of polluted sites in Timor-Leste
- Samples of mushroom-based pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify diverse applications of mushrooms beyond basic food use
- Explain the potential of mushrooms in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries
- Understand the principles of mycoremediation and its potential in Timor-Leste
- Design a basic mycoremediation project for a local polluted site

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Mushroom tasting session: Provide small samples of different mushroom species prepared in various ways (raw, cooked, powdered)
- Ask students to describe flavors, textures, and potential uses for each sample

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Mycoremediation
- Nutraceutical
- Bioaccumulation
- Enzymatic degradation
- Polypore mushrooms

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### a. Culinary Uses and Value-Added Food Products (15 minutes)
- Traditional and modern culinary applications of mushrooms
- Value-added products: mushroom powders, extracts, and fermented foods

### b. Mushroom-based Pharmaceuticals and Nutraceuticals (15 minutes)
- Overview of bioactive compounds in medicinal mushrooms
- Examples of mushroom-derived medicines and supplements
- Potential for developing a mushroom-based pharmaceutical industry in Timor-Leste

### c. Mycoremediation for Soil and Water Pollution (10 minutes)
- Principles of mycoremediation
- Case studies of successful mycoremediation projects
- Potential applications in Timor-Leste (e.g., addressing soil contamination from mining)

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### a. Culinary Exploration (15 minutes)
- In small groups, students create and present ideas for new mushroom-based dishes or products suitable for the Timorese market

### b. Pharmaceutical Potential (15 minutes)
- Students research and present on a medicinal mushroom species with potential for cultivation in Timor-Leste, focusing on its bioactive compounds and possible applications

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

### Mycoremediation Project Design
- Divide class into groups of 3-4 students
- Provide each group with information about a specific polluted site in Timor-Leste
- Groups design a basic mycoremediation project for their assigned site, including:
  * Selection of appropriate mushroom species
  * Substrate preparation methods
  * Implementation strategy
  * Monitoring and evaluation plan
- Groups present their designs to the class for feedback

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion on the most promising applications of mushrooms for Timor-Leste's development
- Quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 2-page proposal for a mushroom-based product (food, pharmaceutical, or remediation) that could be developed in Timor-Leste
- Include information on production methods, potential market, and environmental benefits

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Mycoremediation: The use of fungi to degrade or sequester contaminants in the environment
- Nutraceutical: A food-derived product that provides health benefits in addition to its basic nutritional value
- Bioaccumulation: The gradual accumulation of substances, such as pesticides or other chemicals, in an organism
- Enzymatic degradation: The breakdown of complex molecules by enzymes produced by organisms like fungi
- Polypore mushrooms: A group of fungi that form large fruiting bodies with pores or tubes on the underside, many of which have medicinal properties
