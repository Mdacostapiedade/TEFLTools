# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Fascia and Myofascial Continuity

## 1. Resources Needed

- Anatomy Trains textbook
- Anatomical charts showing fascial layers
- Foam rollers
- Massage cream or oil
- Handouts with key vocabulary and diagrams

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define fascia and describe its basic structure and function
- Explain the concept of myofascial continuity 
- Identify major fascial layers through palpation
- Discuss traditional Timorese perspectives on body interconnectedness

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Students pair up and take turns giving each other a brief shoulder massage
- Instructor guides students to notice different tissue layers they can feel

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Write key terms on board: fascia, myofascia, tensegrity, force transmission
- Students match terms to simple definitions provided on handout
- Review correct definitions as a class

## 5. Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Lecture and discussion on:
  - Structure and function of fascia (use anatomical charts)
  - Concept of myofascial continuity and force transmission
  - Introduction to tensegrity model of the body
- Show video clip demonstrating fascial dissection

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Fascia palpation exercise:
  - In pairs, students practice feeling different fascial layers
  - Instructor demonstrates technique, then circulates to assist
- Myofascial continuity exploration:
  - Using foam rollers, students experience how pressure in one area affects distant areas

## 7. Production Task (20 minutes)

- Small group discussions:
  - Students share examples of traditional Timorese practices or beliefs that relate to body interconnectedness
  - Groups create posters illustrating connections between traditional concepts and fascial anatomy

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: students write brief definitions of key terms
- Review quiz answers as a class
- Summarize main points of the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Read chapter 1 of Anatomy Trains textbook
- Write a 1-page reflection on how the concept of myofascial continuity might apply to a traditional Timorese healing or movement practice

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Fascia: Connective tissue that forms a continuous web throughout the body
- Myofascia: The combination of muscle tissue and its surrounding fascia
- Tensegrity: A structural principle where components balance tension and compression forces
- Force transmission: The ability of fascia to transmit mechanical forces throughout the body
