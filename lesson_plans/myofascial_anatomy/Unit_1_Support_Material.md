# Support Material for Introduction to Fascia and Myofascial Continuity

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Fascia**: A continuous network of connective tissue that surrounds and interpenetrates all body structures.
- **Myofascia**: The combination of muscle tissue and its surrounding fascia.
- **Myofascial continuity**: The concept that fascia forms continuous lines of pull throughout the body.
- **Tensegrity**: A structural principle where components balance tension and compression forces.
- **Force transmission**: The ability of fascia to transmit mechanical forces throughout the body.
- **Palpation**: The act of using touch to examine the body, especially to determine the size, shape, firmness, or location of something.
- **Anatomy Trains**: A concept developed by Thomas Myers that describes myofascial meridians throughout the body.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Fascial Layers Diagram**: A cross-section illustration showing the various layers of fascia in the body, including superficial fascia, deep fascia, and visceral fascia.

2. **Myofascial Continuity Map**: A full-body diagram highlighting major myofascial continuities, such as the Superficial Back Line and Superficial Front Line.

3. **Tensegrity Model**: A simple illustration comparing a traditional "bones as building blocks" model with a tensegrity model of the body.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Vocabulary Matching Worksheet**: 
   - List of key terms on one side
   - Scrambled definitions on the other
   - Students draw lines to match terms with correct definitions

2. **Fascia Exploration Guide**:
   - Step-by-step instructions for palpating different fascial layers
   - Space for students to note their observations

3. **Traditional Practices Reflection Sheet**:
   - Prompts for students to describe traditional Timorese practices related to body interconnectedness
   - Questions linking these practices to fascial concepts

5. Self-massage techniques using foam rollers and therapy balls (provide specific video links or written instructions)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggle to palpate fascial layers.
   **Solution**: Demonstrate on a volunteer, emphasizing gentle touch. Use analogies (e.g., "like feeling the layers of an onion") to help students understand the sensation.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty grasping the concept of myofascial continuity.
   **Solution**: Use visual aids and hands-on demonstrations. Have students perform simple movements while palpating to feel force transmission.

3. **Challenge**: Integrating traditional Timorese concepts with new anatomical information.
   **Solution**: Encourage open discussion and validate traditional knowledge. Use familiar examples from Timorese culture to illustrate fascial concepts.

4. **Challenge**: Students may be hesitant to practice palpation on each other.
   **Solution**: Discuss cultural norms around touch. Offer alternatives like self-palpation or using anatomical models.

5. **Challenge**: Varying levels of prior anatomical knowledge among students.
   **Solution**: Provide pre-reading materials and offer extra support to those who need it. Use peer teaching to leverage students with more background knowledge.
