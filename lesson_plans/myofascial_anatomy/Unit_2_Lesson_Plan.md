# Lesson Plan: The Superficial Back Line

## 1. Resources Needed

- Anatomy Trains textbook by Thomas Myers
- Anatomical charts or posters showing the Superficial Back Line
- Skeleton model
- Foam rollers
- Yoga mats
- Whiteboard and markers

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify the major components of the Superficial Back Line
- Explain the postural and movement functions of the Superficial Back Line
- Analyze common postural patterns related to this line
- Palpate and trace the Superficial Back Line on a partner
- Relate the Superficial Back Line to traditional Timorese activities and postures

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Students pair up and take turns standing back-to-back
- Partner A leans back slightly, allowing their weight to be supported by Partner B
- Partners discuss the sensations they feel along the back of their body
- Switch roles and repeat

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Write the following terms on the whiteboard and briefly explain each:
- Myofascial continuity
- Plantar fascia
- Gastrocnemius
- Hamstrings
- Sacrotuberous ligament
- Erector spinae
- Epicranial fascia

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduction to the Superficial Back Line (SBL)
   - Definition and general path of the SBL
   - Postural and movement functions

2. Detailed anatomy of the SBL
   - Start at the toes and move up the body, describing each component
   - Use anatomical charts and skeleton model for visual aids

3. Common postural patterns related to the SBL
   - Discuss how SBL tension affects posture (e.g., forward head, increased lumbar lordosis)
   - Relate to traditional Timorese postures and activities

4. Palpation guidelines for the SBL
   - Demonstrate palpation techniques for each major component

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. SBL Tracing (20 minutes)
   - Students pair up and take turns tracing the SBL on their partner
   - Instructor circulates to provide guidance and feedback

2. Postural Analysis (20 minutes)
   - In small groups, students analyze photos of people in traditional Timorese postures
   - Identify potential SBL involvement and discuss implications

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. SBL Movement Exploration
   - Students create a movement sequence that emphasizes the SBL
   - Incorporate traditional Timorese movements if possible

2. Case Study Development
   - In pairs, students develop a hypothetical case study of a client with SBL-related postural issues
   - Present to another pair for feedback and discussion

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Conduct a brief quiz on SBL components and functions
- Facilitate a group discussion on how SBL concepts might be applied in local contexts

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Read the Superficial Back Line chapter in the Anatomy Trains textbook
2. Observe and document 3 examples of SBL influence in daily Timorese activities
3. Practice palpating the SBL on a friend or family member

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Myofascial continuity: Continuous connection of muscle and fascia forming functional lines in the body
- Plantar fascia: Thick connective tissue on the bottom of the foot
- Gastrocnemius: Large calf muscle
- Hamstrings: Group of muscles at the back of the thigh
- Sacrotuberous ligament: Strong ligament connecting the sacrum to the ischial tuberosity
- Erector spinae: Group of muscles and tendons running along the spine
- Epicranial fascia: Connective tissue covering the skull, also known as the galea aponeurotica
