# Support Material for Superficial Back Line Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Superficial Back Line (SBL)**: A myofascial meridian running from the toes to the forehead along the posterior surface of the body.
- **Myofascial continuity**: Continuous connection of muscle and fascia forming functional lines in the body.
- **Plantar fascia**: Thick connective tissue on the bottom of the foot.
- **Gastrocnemius**: Large calf muscle.
- **Hamstrings**: Group of muscles at the back of the thigh.
- **Sacrotuberous ligament**: Strong ligament connecting the sacrum to the ischial tuberosity.
- **Erector spinae**: Group of muscles and tendons running along the spine.
- **Epicranial fascia**: Connective tissue covering the skull, also known as the galea aponeurotica.
- **Postural pattern**: Habitual alignment of body segments in relation to each other.
- **Palpation**: Examination by touch for diagnostic purposes.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Full Body SBL Diagram**: A side-view illustration of the human body showing the complete path of the Superficial Back Line from toes to forehead. Each major component should be clearly labeled.

2. **SBL Component Close-ups**: A series of detailed illustrations focusing on each major component of the SBL:
   - Plantar fascia and toe flexors
   - Achilles tendon and gastrocnemius
   - Hamstrings
   - Sacrotuberous ligament
   - Erector spinae
   - Epicranial fascia

3. **Common Postural Patterns**: Side-view illustrations of common postural patterns related to SBL tension:
   - Forward head posture
   - Increased lumbar lordosis
   - Knee hyperextension

4. **Traditional Timorese Postures**: Illustrations or photographs depicting common traditional Timorese postures or activities that involve the SBL.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **SBL Tracing Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for palpating and tracing the SBL on a partner, including anatomical landmarks to guide the process.

2. **Postural Analysis Worksheet**: A template for students to use when analyzing photos of traditional Timorese postures. Include sections for:
   - Description of the posture
   - Identification of potential SBL involvement
   - Analysis of how the SBL might be affected
   - Suggestions for balancing or addressing any issues

3. **Case Study Template**: A worksheet for students to develop their hypothetical case study, including:
   - Client background
   - Observed postural patterns
   - SBL-related issues
   - Proposed treatment plan

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Relevant chapters from "Anatomy Trains" by Thomas Myers
2. Research articles on the role of fascia in posture and movement
3. Online video tutorials demonstrating SBL palpation techniques
4. List of common Timorese activities and their relationship to the SBL
5. Recommended stretching and strengthening exercises for the SBL

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to palpate the SBL accurately.
   **Solution**: Provide clear anatomical landmarks, use contrasting movements to highlight the structures, and offer one-on-one guidance during practice.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty relating Western anatomical concepts to traditional Timorese understanding.
   **Solution**: Use analogies from local culture, invite a traditional healer as a guest speaker to bridge concepts, and encourage students to share their own cultural perspectives.

3. **Challenge**: Students feeling uncomfortable with partner work and palpation.
   **Solution**: Discuss the importance of consent and boundaries, allow students to choose their partners, and offer alternatives like self-palpation or working on a model.

4. **Challenge**: Varying levels of prior anatomical knowledge among students.
   **Solution**: Provide pre-reading materials, offer extra support sessions, and use peer teaching to help balance knowledge levels.

5. **Challenge**: Limited access to anatomical models or technology.
   **Solution**: Utilize creative alternatives like drawing on the body, creating simple models from local materials, or using free online 3D anatomy resources when possible.
