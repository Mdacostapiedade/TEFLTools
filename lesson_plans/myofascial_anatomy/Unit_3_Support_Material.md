# Support Material for Superficial Front Line and Lateral Line Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Superficial Front Line (SFL)**: A myofascial meridian running from the toes to the frontal bone, including anterior leg and trunk muscles.
- **Lateral Line (LL)**: A myofascial meridian running from the lateral foot to the skull, including side body muscles.
- **Fascia**: Connective tissue surrounding muscles, bones, and organs, forming a continuous web throughout the body.
- **Myofascial continuity**: The concept that muscles and fascia form functional chains across body segments.
- **Tensegrity**: A structural principle combining tension and compression elements to create stable yet flexible structures.
- **Proprioception**: The body's ability to sense its position and movement in space.
- **Tibialis anterior**: A muscle in the anterior compartment of the leg, part of the SFL.
- **Quadriceps**: A group of four muscles on the front of the thigh, part of the SFL.
- **Rectus abdominis**: The "six-pack" muscle on the front of the abdomen, part of the SFL.
- **Sternocleidomastoid**: A muscle in the neck that rotates the head, part of the SFL.
- **Peroneal muscles**: Muscles on the lateral side of the lower leg, part of the LL.
- **Iliotibial band**: A thick band of fascia running down the lateral thigh, part of the LL.
- **Tensor fasciae latae**: A muscle at the top of the iliotibial band, part of the LL.
- **Obliques**: Muscles on the side of the abdomen, part of the LL.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. Full-body diagram showing the path of the Superficial Front Line:
   - Start at the toes, highlighting toe extensors
   - Move up the anterior leg, emphasizing tibialis anterior
   - Continue to the thigh, showing quadriceps
   - Trace up the trunk, highlighting rectus abdominis and sternalis
   - End at the neck with sternocleidomastoid

2. Full-body diagram showing the path of the Lateral Line:
   - Begin at the lateral foot, showing peroneal muscles
   - Move up the lateral leg, highlighting the iliotibial band
   - Continue to the hip, showing tensor fasciae latae
   - Trace up the trunk, emphasizing obliques and intercostals
   - End at the side of the neck with splenius capitis

3. Simplified stick figure diagrams showing:
   - Engagement of the SFL in standing posture and walking
   - Engagement of the LL in side-bending and single-leg stance

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggle to visualize the continuity of the lines.
   - Solution: Use colored elastic bands or ropes on a volunteer to physically represent the lines. Have students trace the lines on each other with their fingers.

2. Challenge: Difficulty relating myofascial concepts to Timorese cultural context.
   - Solution: Invite a local movement expert or traditional healer as a guest speaker to discuss body concepts in Timorese culture. Facilitate a discussion on similarities and differences with myofascial meridians.

3. Challenge: Students have trouble feeling or palpating the lines on themselves or partners.
   - Solution: Demonstrate palpation techniques clearly, emphasizing gentle touch. Provide guidance on finding bony landmarks as reference points. Use foam rollers to enhance sensation of the lines.

4. Challenge: Confusion about the functional roles of SFL and LL in movement.
   - Solution: Incorporate more movement-based learning. Have students perform simple movements (e.g., walking, side-bending) while focusing on the sensation in different parts of the lines.

5. Challenge: Difficulty applying concepts to analysis of Timorese movements.
   - Solution: Start with simple, slow movements before progressing to more complex dance or martial arts forms. Break down movements into phases and analyze each phase separately.

6. Challenge: Language barriers in understanding anatomical terms.
   - Solution: Create a bilingual glossary with English and Tetum terms. Use visual aids and body painting to reinforce anatomical locations.
