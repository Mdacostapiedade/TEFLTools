# Lesson Plan: The Spiral Line and Arm Lines

## 1. Resources Needed

- Anatomy Trains textbook
- Anatomical charts showing the Spiral Line and Arm Lines
- Foam rollers
- Resistance bands
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with blank body outlines for drawing

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the concept of the Spiral Line and its role in rotation
- Identify the components of the Arm Lines
- Describe how the Arm Lines connect to the trunk
- Relate the Spiral Line and Arm Lines to Timorese crafts and daily activities
- Perform basic assessments of these lines on a partner

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Students pair up and take turns guiding each other through a spiral movement, starting from the feet and moving up through the body to the head
- Discuss how the movement felt and which parts of the body were engaged

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

- Write key terms on the whiteboard: Spiral Line, Arm Lines, rotation, contralateral, ipsilateral
- Briefly explain each term and have students repeat them

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### The Spiral Line
- Explain the anatomy of the Spiral Line using charts and the textbook
- Discuss its role in creating and controlling rotation in the body
- Relate the Spiral Line to common Timorese activities like weaving or martial arts

### The Arm Lines
- Introduce the four Arm Lines: Superficial Front, Deep Front, Superficial Back, Deep Back
- Describe the myofascial components of each line
- Explain how the Arm Lines connect to the trunk and integrate with other lines
- Discuss the relevance of Arm Lines to Timorese crafts and daily activities

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- In pairs, students palpate the Spiral Line on each other, starting at the skull and following its path down the body
- Using resistance bands, students explore the Arm Lines through various arm movements, feeling the connections to the trunk

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Students draw the Spiral Line and Arm Lines on blank body outlines, labeling key structures
- In small groups, students create and demonstrate a movement sequence that highlights the function of either the Spiral Line or one of the Arm Lines

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion: How do the Spiral Line and Arm Lines contribute to everyday movements in Timorese life?
- Quick quiz: Students identify which line is primarily involved in various activities (e.g., throwing a spear, carrying a water jug on the head)

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Observe and document three daily activities or crafts in their community that utilize the Spiral Line or Arm Lines
- Practice palpating the Spiral Line and Arm Lines on a family member or friend

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Spiral Line: A myofascial meridian that wraps around the body in a helical pattern, contributing to rotational movements and postural control
- Arm Lines: Four myofascial continuities that run from the trunk to the fingers, facilitating arm and hand function
- Rotation: Movement around a central axis
- Contralateral: Relating to or occurring on the opposite side of the body
- Ipsilateral: Relating to or occurring on the same side of the body
