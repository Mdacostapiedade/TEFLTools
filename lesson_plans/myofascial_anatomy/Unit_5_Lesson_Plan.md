# Lesson Plan: The Deep Front Line

## 1. Resources Needed

- Anatomy Trains textbook by Thomas Myers
- Anatomical charts or models showing the Deep Front Line
- Yoga mats or cushions for floor work
- Foam rollers
- Handouts with diagrams of the Deep Front Line
- Whiteboard and markers

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify the major components of the Deep Front Line
- Explain the role of the Deep Front Line in core stability and breathing
- Relate the Deep Front Line to traditional Timorese practices
- Perform basic assessments of core stability using the Deep Front Line concept
- Practice breathing exercises that engage the Deep Front Line

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Students pair up and take turns guiding each other through a gentle spinal wave movement, starting from the tailbone and moving up to the head, emphasizing the connection through the core of the body.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Write the following terms on the whiteboard and briefly explain each:
- Psoas
- Diaphragm
- Pelvic floor
- Visceral fascia
- Core stability
- Anterior longitudinal ligament

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduction to the Deep Front Line
   - Define its role as the body's core stabilizing system
   - Explain its connection to breathing and organ support

2. Anatomy of the Deep Front Line
   - Use anatomical charts to show the path from the inner arch of the foot to the tongue
   - Highlight key structures: deep foot muscles, posterior tibialis, psoas, diaphragm, scalenes

3. Core Function and Breathing
   - Discuss the interplay between the diaphragm, pelvic floor, and abdominal muscles
   - Explain the concept of intra-abdominal pressure

4. Cultural Connection
   - Relate the Deep Front Line to traditional Timorese breathing practices in martial arts or meditation
   - Discuss core-intensive activities in Timorese daily life (e.g., carrying heavy loads, farming)

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Palpation Exercise (15 minutes)
   - In pairs, students palpate accessible parts of the Deep Front Line on each other
   - Focus on feeling the connection between the inner ankle, inner knee, and inner thigh

2. Breathing Awareness (10 minutes)
   - Guide students through diaphragmatic breathing, emphasizing the expansion of the lower ribs and abdomen
   - Have students place hands on their lower ribs to feel the movement

3. Core Stability Assessment (15 minutes)
   - Teach and practice the Active Straight Leg Raise test
   - Students assess each other and discuss how the Deep Front Line is involved

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Small Group Activity (20 minutes)
   - Divide class into groups of 3-4
   - Each group creates a simple movement sequence that engages the Deep Front Line
   - Incorporate elements of traditional Timorese movement if possible

2. Presentation (10 minutes)
   - Groups demonstrate their sequences to the class
   - Class discusses how each sequence relates to the Deep Front Line

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Conduct a brief Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Summarize key points about the Deep Front Line's role in core stability and breathing
- Highlight the cultural connections made during the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Practice the breathing exercises learned in class daily for one week, journaling any changes noticed in core awareness or stability.
2. Research a traditional Timorese activity that engages the core and write a short paragraph on how it might relate to the Deep Front Line.
3. Read the Deep Front Line chapter in the Anatomy Trains textbook.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Psoas: A deep core muscle connecting the lumbar spine to the femur
- Diaphragm: The primary muscle of respiration, separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities
- Pelvic floor: The muscular base of the abdomen, supporting the pelvic organs
- Visceral fascia: Connective tissue surrounding and supporting internal organs
- Core stability: The ability to control the position and movement of the central portion of the body
- Anterior longitudinal ligament: A ligament running along the front of the spinal column, part of the Deep Front Line
