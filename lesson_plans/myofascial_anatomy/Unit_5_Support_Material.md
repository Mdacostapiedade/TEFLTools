# Support Material for "The Deep Front Line" Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Deep Front Line**: A myofascial meridian running from the inner arch of the foot to the tongue, serving as the body's core stabilizing system.
- **Psoas**: A deep core muscle connecting the lumbar spine to the femur, crucial for hip flexion and spinal stability.
- **Diaphragm**: The primary muscle of respiration, separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities.
- **Pelvic floor**: The muscular base of the abdomen, supporting the pelvic organs.
- **Visceral fascia**: Connective tissue surrounding and supporting internal organs.
- **Core stability**: The ability to control the position and movement of the central portion of the body.
- **Anterior longitudinal ligament**: A ligament running along the front of the spinal column, part of the Deep Front Line.
- **Intra-abdominal pressure**: The pressure created within the abdominal cavity, important for core stability and breathing.
- **Posterior tibialis**: A muscle in the lower leg that supports the arch of the foot and is part of the Deep Front Line.
- **Scalenes**: Neck muscles that assist in breathing and are part of the upper portion of the Deep Front Line.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Deep Front Line Overview Diagram**: A full-body illustration showing the path of the Deep Front Line from the inner foot to the tongue. Key structures are labeled, including the posterior tibialis, psoas, diaphragm, and scalenes.

2. **Core Stability Diagram**: A cross-sectional view of the torso showing the interaction between the diaphragm, pelvic floor, and abdominal muscles. Arrows indicate the direction of forces during breathing and core engagement.

3. **Breathing Mechanics Illustration**: A series of images showing the movement of the ribcage, diaphragm, and abdominal wall during inhalation and exhalation.

4. **Active Straight Leg Raise Test Diagram**: Step-by-step illustrations demonstrating the proper execution of the Active Straight Leg Raise test, with indicators of what to observe for core stability assessment.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Deep Front Line Palpation Guide**: A worksheet with a body outline where students can mark the locations they palpated, with space to note their observations about tissue quality and connections felt.

2. **Breathing Awareness Journal**: A weekly log for students to record their practice of diaphragmatic breathing, including prompts for noting sensations, challenges, and improvements.

3. **Core Stability Assessment Checklist**: A form for recording observations during the Active Straight Leg Raise test, including space to note compensations and asymmetries.

4. **Traditional Timorese Activities and the Deep Front Line**: A worksheet prompting students to research and describe how specific Timorese activities (e.g., tais weaving, rice farming) might engage the Deep Front Line.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to palpate deep structures.
   **Tip**: Use visual aids and surface anatomy landmarks to guide palpation. Demonstrate on a volunteer and have students practice in pairs with feedback.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in relating abstract anatomical concepts to real-life movement.
   **Tip**: Incorporate more movement-based activities and relate concepts to familiar Timorese activities. Use analogies and metaphors relevant to local culture.

3. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of the Deep Front Line.
   **Tip**: Break down the line into smaller segments and teach them progressively. Use color-coding in diagrams to make connections clearer.

4. **Challenge**: Resistance to new concepts that may conflict with traditional beliefs.
   **Tip**: Approach the material with cultural sensitivity. Draw parallels between Deep Front Line concepts and traditional Timorese understanding of the body whenever possible.

5. **Challenge**: Varying levels of prior anatomical knowledge among students.
   **Tip**: Provide pre-reading materials and offer additional support sessions for those needing to catch up on basic anatomy.

6. **Challenge**: Difficulty in assessing core stability accurately.
   **Tip**: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for assessment techniques. Use video demonstrations and practice extensively in pairs with instructor supervision.
