# Lesson Plan: Integration and Practical Application of Anatomy Trains

## 1. Resources Needed

- Anatomy Trains textbook (Myers, 2020)
- Anatomical charts and models
- Foam rollers and therapy balls
- Massage tables or mats
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with blank body outlines for assessment notes
- Projector for slides/videos

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Synthesize knowledge of all myofascial meridians
- Perform a whole-body myofascial assessment
- Develop treatment strategies based on Anatomy Trains concepts
- Adapt assessment and treatment approaches for cultural appropriateness in Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (15 minutes)

- Partner mirror exercise: In pairs, students mirror each other's movements, focusing on whole-body integration and flow between myofascial lines
- Brief discussion on how this exercise relates to myofascial continuity

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

- Review key terms: myofascial meridians, tensegrity, fascial planes, myofascial force transmission
- Introduce new terms: global postural patterns, compensatory strategies, cultural somatic patterns

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

- Overview of all Anatomy Trains lines and their interactions
- Demonstration of a full-body myofascial assessment
- Discussion of treatment strategy development based on assessment findings
- Presentation on cultural considerations for bodywork in Timor-Leste

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

- Small group rotations (20 minutes each):
  1. Palpation practice of all myofascial lines
  2. Postural assessment using Anatomy Trains framework
  3. Movement analysis incorporating multiple myofascial meridians

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

- In pairs, students perform a full-body myofascial assessment on each other
- Each student develops a basic treatment plan based on their partner's assessment
- Groups discuss how to adapt their approaches for Timorese cultural context

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion: Key takeaways from the assessments and treatment planning
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions or concerns
- Brief review of main points covered in the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Conduct a myofascial self-assessment and develop a personal treatment/movement plan
- Research one traditional Timorese bodywork or movement practice and analyze it using Anatomy Trains concepts
- Prepare a brief presentation on findings for next class

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Global postural patterns: Overall body positioning and alignment resulting from the interplay of multiple myofascial meridians
- Compensatory strategies: Adaptations in posture or movement to accommodate restrictions or imbalances in the myofascial system
- Cultural somatic patterns: Habitual postures, movements, and body usage shaped by cultural practices and environment
- Myofascial force transmission: The process by which tension generated in one part of the fascial network is distributed to other areas of the body
- Tensegrity: A structural principle where the integrity of the whole is maintained through a balance of tension and compression forces
