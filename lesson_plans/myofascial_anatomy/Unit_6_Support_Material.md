# Support Material for Anatomy Trains Integration Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Global postural patterns**: Overall body positioning and alignment resulting from the interplay of multiple myofascial meridians
- **Compensatory strategies**: Adaptations in posture or movement to accommodate restrictions or imbalances in the myofascial system
- **Cultural somatic patterns**: Habitual postures, movements, and body usage shaped by cultural practices and environment
- **Myofascial force transmission**: The process by which tension generated in one part of the fascial network is distributed to other areas of the body
- **Tensegrity**: A structural principle where the integrity of the whole is maintained through a balance of tension and compression forces
- **Myofascial meridians**: Continuous lines of fascia and muscle that transmit tension and movement throughout the body
- **Fascial planes**: Layers of connective tissue that separate and connect different anatomical structures

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Anatomy Trains Overview Diagram**: A full-body illustration showing all major myofascial meridians color-coded and labeled.

2. **Tensegrity Model**: A simple stick-and-elastic model demonstrating the principle of tensegrity in the human body.

3. **Cultural Posture Comparison**: Side-by-side illustrations of common postures in Timorese daily activities versus Western postures, highlighting differences in myofascial engagement.

4. **Myofascial Force Transmission Flowchart**: A diagram showing how force applied to one area of the body is transmitted through myofascial connections to other areas.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Whole-Body Assessment Form**: A blank body outline (anterior, posterior, and lateral views) with space to note observations about each myofascial line, postural patterns, and areas of tension or restriction.

2. **Treatment Strategy Planner**: A worksheet with prompts to guide students through developing a treatment plan based on assessment findings, including:
   - Primary myofascial lines affected
   - Compensatory patterns observed
   - Short-term treatment goals
   - Long-term treatment goals
   - Specific techniques to address each issue
   - Cultural considerations for treatment approach

3. **Cultural Adaptation Checklist**: A list of questions to consider when adapting assessment and treatment approaches for Timorese clients, such as:
   - Is the level of touch culturally appropriate?
   - Are the assessment positions respectful of local customs?
   - How can traditional Timorese healing concepts be integrated?
   - Are there any cultural taboos to be aware of in treatment?

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to palpate myofascial lines
   - **Tip**: Use visual aids, such as elastic bands on a skeleton model, to demonstrate the lines. Practice palpation on different body types to feel variations.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in understanding the concept of myofascial force transmission
   - **Tip**: Use interactive demonstrations with a long piece of fabric or elastic to show how tension at one end affects the entire length.

3. **Challenge**: Integrating Western concepts with traditional Timorese healing practices
   - **Tip**: Invite local healers as guest speakers to discuss their approaches. Encourage students to find parallels between Anatomy Trains concepts and traditional beliefs.

4. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of whole-body assessment
   - **Tip**: Break down the assessment into smaller sections, focusing on one or two myofascial lines at a time before integrating the whole.

5. **Challenge**: Cultural sensitivity in touch and assessment techniques
   - **Tip**: Discuss cultural norms around touch in Timor-Leste. Practice using minimal touch techniques and verbal cues for assessment when appropriate.

6. **Challenge**: Adapting treatment strategies for local lifestyles and activities
   - **Tip**: Assign research projects on common Timorese occupations and activities. Discuss how these might influence myofascial patterns and treatment approaches.
