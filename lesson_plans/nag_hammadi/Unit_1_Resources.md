# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "The Gospel of Thomas"

These are the secret sayings that the living Jesus spoke and Didymos Judas Thomas recorded.

1. And he said, "Whoever discovers the interpretation of these sayings will not taste death."

2. Jesus said, "Those who seek should not stop seeking until they find. When they find, they will be disturbed. When they are disturbed, they will marvel, and will reign over all. [And after they have reigned they will rest.]"

3. Jesus said, "If your leaders say to you, 'Look, the (Father's) kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the kingdom is inside you and it is outside you. When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will understand that you are children of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and you are the poverty."

# Lecture Notes

## The Discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library

## Key Concepts in Gnosticism

1. Gnosis (Knowledge)
   - Direct, experiential knowledge of the divine
   - Contrasted with faith or belief
   - Path to salvation and spiritual liberation

2. Dualism
   - Spiritual realm vs. material world
   - Good vs. evil, light vs. darkness
   - True God vs. Demiurge

3. Divine Spark
   - Fragment of divine light trapped in human bodies
   - Humans as spiritual beings in a material world
   - Goal: Awakening to one's true nature

4. Demiurge
   - Lower deity responsible for creating the material world
   - Often portrayed as ignorant or malevolent
   - Identified with the God of the Old Testament by some Gnostics

5. Sophia (Wisdom)
   - Divine feminine figure in Gnostic mythology
   - Often associated with the fall from divine unity
   - Her restoration is part of the cosmic drama

6. Archons
   - Rulers or powers that control the material world
   - Often associated with planets or celestial spheres
   - Obstacles to the soul's ascent to the divine realm
