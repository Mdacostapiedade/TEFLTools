# Excerpts and Short Stories

## The Gospel of Thomas (Excerpts)

These sayings attributed to Jesus are from the Coptic text of The Gospel of Thomas, translated by Thomas O. Lambdin:

1. These are the secret sayings which the living Jesus spoke and which Didymos Judas Thomas wrote down.
2. And he said, "Whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will not experience death."
3. Jesus said, "Let him who seeks continue seeking until he finds. When he finds, he will become troubled. When he becomes troubled, he will be astonished, and he will rule over the All."
5. Jesus said, "Recognize what is in your sight, and that which is hidden from you will become plain to you. For there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest."
22. Jesus saw infants being suckled. He said to his disciples, "These infants being suckled are like those who enter the kingdom." They said to him, "Shall we then, as children, enter the kingdom?" Jesus said to them, "When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and when you make the male and the female one and the same, so that the male not be male nor the female female; and when you fashion eyes in the place of an eye, and a hand in place of a hand, and a foot in place of a foot, and a likeness in place of a likeness; then will you enter the kingdom."
77. Jesus said, "It is I who am the light which is above them all. It is I who am the all. From me did the all come forth, and unto me did the all extend. Split a piece of wood, and I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there."

# Lecture Notes

## Dualism in Gnostic Thought

- Definition: The belief in two opposing forces or principles in the universe
- In Gnosticism: Contrast between the spiritual realm (good) and material world (evil/flawed)
- Spiritual realm: Associated with the true God, light, knowledge
- Material world: Created by the Demiurge, associated with darkness, ignorance
- Implications for human existence: Humans as spiritual beings trapped in material bodies
- Comparison with other dualistic traditions (e.g., Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism)

## The Divine Spark

- Concept: A fragment of the divine trapped within human beings
- Origin: Belief that humans contain a piece of the true God's essence
- Purpose: To be awakened and reunited with its divine source
- Role of gnosis: Knowledge as the key to recognizing and liberating the divine spark
- Parallels with other mystical traditions (e.g., Neoplatonism, Kabbalah)

## The Demiurge and Sophia

- Demiurge: The creator of the material world in Gnostic cosmology
- Characteristics: Often portrayed as ignorant, flawed, or malevolent
- Relationship to the true God: Lower divine being, often in opposition to the highest God
- Sophia (Wisdom): Divine feminine figure in Gnostic myths
- Sophia's role: Often associated with the creation of the Demiurge and the material world
- Variations in Gnostic myths regarding Sophia and the Demiurge

## Salvation through Gnosis

- Gnosis: Esoteric knowledge of spiritual truth
- Contrast with faith-based salvation in mainstream Christianity
- Types of knowledge in Gnosticism:
  1. Knowledge of the divine realm
  2. Self-knowledge (recognizing one's divine nature)
  3. Knowledge of cosmic processes and one's place in them
- Methods of attaining gnosis: Revelation, mystical experiences, esoteric teachings
- The role of Jesus in Gnostic salvation: Revealer of secret knowledge rather than sacrificial savior
