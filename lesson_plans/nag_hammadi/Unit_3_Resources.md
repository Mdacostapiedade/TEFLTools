# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Sethian Gnosticism: Excerpt from "The Apocryphon of John"

```
I am the one who is with you always. I am the Father, I am the Mother, I am the Son.
I am the undefiled and incorruptible one. Now I have come to teach you what is
and what was and what will come to pass, that you may know the things which are not
manifest and those which are manifest, and to teach you concerning the Perfect Man.
Now, therefore, lift up your face, that you may receive the things that I shall teach you
today, and may tell them to your fellow spirits who are from the immovable race of the Perfect Man.
```

## Valentinian Gnosticism: Excerpt from "The Gospel of Truth"

```
The gospel of truth is joy for those who have received from the Father of truth the grace of knowing him,
through the power of the Word that came forth from the pleroma, the one who is in the thought and the mind of the Father,
that is, the one who is addressed as the Savior, (that) being the name of the work he is to perform for the redemption
of those who were ignorant of the Father, while in the name of the gospel is the proclamation of hope,
being discovery for those who search for him.
```

## Mandaeism: Excerpt from "The Ginza Rba"

```
In the name of the Great First Strange Life from the worlds of light, the sublime that stands above all works.
This is the beginning of the Great Ginza, which is the treasure and great mystery of the first life.
Blessed and praised be the Great First Life in its dwelling, and praised be the great place of light and the everlasting abode.
```

## Manichaeism: Excerpt from "The Kephalaia"

```
The First Man is the first emanation of the Father of Greatness. He is called to battle the forces of darkness.
Armed with his five sons, who are the five light elements, he descends to the boundary between the realm of light and the realm of darkness.
There he engages in combat with the forces of the King of Darkness, sacrificing himself to save the light particles from being devoured by the dark.
```
