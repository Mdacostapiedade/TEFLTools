# Text Excerpts

## The Secret Book of John (Apocryphon of John)

"I am the one who is with you always. I am the Father, I am the Mother, I am the Son. I am the undefiled and incorruptible one. Now I have come to teach you what is and what was and what will come to pass, that you may know the things which are not apparent and those which are apparent, and to teach you concerning the Perfect Man. Now, therefore, lift up your face, that you may receive the things that I shall teach you today, and may tell them to your fellow spirits who are from the immovable race of the Perfect Man."

"There is a perfect Aeon existing before [all]. Its name is the Invisible Virgin Spirit, the Perfect One. No one has seen it. It is inconceivable and immeasurable light. It is pure, holy, and immaculate. It is ineffable and is perfect in incorruptibility. It is not in perfection, nor in blessedness, nor in divinity, but it is far superior. It is not corporeal nor is it incorporeal. It is neither large nor is it small. It is impossible to say, 'How much is it?' or 'What kind is it?' for no one can understand it."

## The Gospel of Thomas

"Jesus said, 'If those who lead you say to you, "See, the kingdom is in the sky," then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, "It is in the sea," then the fish will precede you. Rather, the kingdom is inside of you, and it is outside of you. When you come to know yourselves, then you will become known, and you will realize that it is you who are the sons of the living father. But if you will not know yourselves, you dwell in poverty and it is you who are that poverty.'"

# Lecture Notes

## Gnostic Cosmology

1. The Pleroma
   - The spiritual realm of fullness
   - Dwelling place of the true, unknowable God
   - Composed of divine emanations called Aeons

2. The Fall of Sophia
   - Sophia, the last Aeon, desires to create without her partner
   - Her imperfect creation results in the Demiurge

3. The Demiurge
   - Ignorant creator god, often identified with the Old Testament God
   - Creates the material world and Archons

4. The Material World
   - Seen as a flawed creation, a prison for divine sparks
   - Ruled by Archons who keep humanity ignorant

## Gnostic Anthropology

1. Creation of Humanity
   - Humans created by the Demiurge, but contain a divine spark
   - The divine spark is a fragment of Sophia or the Pleroma

2. Three Types of Humans
   - Pneumatics: Spiritual individuals capable of achieving gnosis
   - Psychics: Mixed nature, capable of limited spiritual understanding
   - Hylics: Dominated by material nature, incapable of gnosis

3. The Human Soul
   - Viewed as trapped in the material body
   - Salvation achieved through awakening to one's true divine nature

4. Destiny of the Soul
   - Goal is to escape the material world and return to the Pleroma
   - Achieved through gnosis (spiritual knowledge)

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the Gnostic view of creation differ from traditional Christian or Timorese creation stories?

2. What are the implications of the Gnostic belief in a flawed creator god (Demiurge)?

3. How might the Gnostic concept of the divine spark within humans relate to Timorese beliefs about the human soul?

4. In what ways does the Gnostic division of humans into pneumatics, psychics, and hylics compare to social or spiritual hierarchies in Timorese society?

5. How does the Gnostic goal of escaping the material world compare with Timorese concepts of the afterlife?

6. What ethical implications might arise from the Gnostic view of the material world as inherently flawed?

7. How might Gnostic ideas about self-knowledge and awakening relate to Timorese spiritual practices or initiation rites?

8. In what ways could Gnostic cosmology challenge or complement Timorese traditional cosmology?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Comparative Cosmology Reflection

1. Write a 500-word reflection comparing Gnostic cosmology with Timorese traditional cosmology.

2. Begin by briefly summarizing the key elements of Gnostic cosmology (Pleroma, Demiurge, material world, etc.).

3. Then, describe the main features of Timorese traditional cosmology, focusing on creation myths, the structure of the universe, and spiritual beings.

4. Compare and contrast the two cosmologies, noting similarities and differences.

5. Reflect on how these different worldviews might impact one's understanding of human nature, purpose, and spirituality.

6. Conclude by discussing what insights or questions arise from this comparison for your own spiritual or philosophical perspective.

# Assignment Details

## Visual Representation of Cosmologies

1. Create two visual representations: one of Gnostic cosmology and one of Timorese traditional cosmology.

2. Use any artistic medium (drawing, painting, digital art, collage, etc.).

3. For the Gnostic cosmology, include:
   - The Pleroma
   - The Demiurge
   - The material world
   - Archons
   - The place of humans in the cosmos

4. For the Timorese cosmology, include:
   - Creation story elements
   - Spiritual realms or worlds
   - Divine or spiritual beings
   - The place of humans in the cosmos

5. Add labels and a brief written explanation (50-100 words) for each key element in your visuals.

6. Be prepared to present and explain your visual representations to the class.

## Timorese Creation Myth Example

"In the beginning, there was only the sea and the sky. The creator god Maromak descended from the sky and planted a rock in the sea. From this rock grew the land of Timor. Maromak then created the first humans from clay and breathed life into them. He gave them knowledge of fire, agriculture, and weaving. The first humans lived in harmony with nature and the spirits of the land."

## Comparative Table: Gnostic and Timorese Concepts

| Concept | Gnosticism | Timorese Tradition |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| Creator | Demiurge (flawed creator) | Maromak (benevolent creator) |
| Origin of Evil | Ignorance of the Demiurge | Various malevolent spirits |
| Human Nature | Divine spark trapped in matter | Connection to ancestors and land |
| Spiritual Goal | Escape material world, return to Pleroma | Maintain harmony with nature and spirits |
| Afterlife | Return to spiritual realm | Ancestral realm or reincarnation |
| Knowledge | Secret gnosis leads to salvation | Traditional wisdom passed through generations |

## Meditation Exercise: Exploring Inner Divinity

1. Find a comfortable seated position and close your eyes.
2. Take several deep breaths, focusing on your breath.
3. Visualize a small spark of light in the center of your chest.
4. As you breathe, imagine this light growing brighter and expanding.
5. Reflect on the Gnostic concept of the divine spark within.
6. Consider how this idea relates to your own sense of inner wisdom or divinity.
7. After 5-10 minutes, slowly open your eyes and return to the present.
8. Journal about your experience and any insights gained.
