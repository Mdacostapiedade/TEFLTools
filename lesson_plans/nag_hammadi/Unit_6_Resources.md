# Excerpts and Short Texts

## Gospel of Philip on Baptism and the Bridal Chamber

"The Lord [did] everything in a mystery, a baptism and a chrism and a eucharist and a redemption and a bridal chamber. [...] He said, "I came to make [the things below] like the things [above, and the things] outside like those [inside. I came to unite] them in the place." [...] In this world, those who put on garments are better than the garments. In the Kingdom of Heaven, the garments are better than those who have put them on.

It is through water and fire that the whole place is purified - the visible by the visible, the hidden by the hidden. There are some things hidden through those visible. There is water in water, there is fire in chrism.

The chrism is superior to baptism, for it is from the word "Chrism" that we have been called "Christians," certainly not because of the word "baptism". And it is because of the chrism that "the Christ" has his name. For the Father anointed the Son, and the Son anointed the apostles, and the apostles anointed us. He who has been anointed possesses everything. He possesses the resurrection, the light, the cross, the Holy Spirit. The Father gave him this in the bridal chamber; he merely accepted (the gift). The Father was in the Son and the Son in the Father. This is the Kingdom of Heaven."
