# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Gnostic Themes in Modern Literature

### Excerpt from "Demian" by Hermann Hesse

"I wanted only to try to live in accord with the promptings which came from my true self. Why was that so very difficult?"

"The bird fights its way out of the egg. The egg is the world. Who would be born must first destroy a world. The bird flies to God. That God's name is Abraxas."

### Excerpt from "VALIS" by Philip K. Dick

"We did not fall because of a moral error; we fell because of an intellectual error: that of taking the phenomenal world as real. Therefore we are morally innocent. It is the Empire in its various disguised polyforms which tells us we have sinned. 'The Empire never ended.'"
