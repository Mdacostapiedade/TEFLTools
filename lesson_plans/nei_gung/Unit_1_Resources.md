- Harmony between body, mind, and spirit
- Balance of Yin and Yang energies
- Alignment with natural cycles and rhythms

### Key Principles
1. Relaxation (Song): Physical and mental relaxation to allow Qi flow
2. Intention (Yi): Using focused mind to guide Qi
3. Rooting (Gen): Grounding and stability in postures
4. Centrality (Zhong Ding): Maintaining center of gravity

## Wuji Standing Posture

- Meaning: "Without ridgepole" or primordial emptiness
- Represents a state of limitless potential and balance

### Correct Alignment
1. Feet shoulder-width apart, parallel
2. Knees slightly bent, not locked
3. Pelvis tucked slightly, tailbone pointing down
4. Spine elongated, head as if suspended from above
5. Shoulders relaxed, arms hanging naturally
6. Tongue touching roof of mouth behind front teeth

### Mental Aspects
- Cultivate a sense of inner stillness
- Focus on breath and body sensations
- Let go of unnecessary tension

### Progression

## Short Reading: "The Dao of Health"

Health in Daoist philosophy is not merely the absence of illness, but a state of harmony between body, mind, and spirit. The ancient Daoists observed nature and sought to align human life with its rhythms and patterns. They saw the human body as a microcosm of the universe, with energy channels mirroring rivers and organs corresponding to natural elements.

Nei Gong practice is one way to cultivate this harmony. By standing in Wuji, we return to a state of primordial balance. Through conscious breathing and subtle movements, we guide Qi through our body's landscapes, nourishing our being like rain feeding the earth. As we practice, we may find that health emerges not from forcing or striving, but from allowing our natural vitality to flow freely.

In Timor-Leste, with its rich traditions of herbal medicine and spiritual healing, we can explore how these ancient Chinese insights might complement local wisdom. Both traditions recognize the interconnectedness of all aspects of health and the importance of living in harmony with nature. By integrating these perspectives, we may discover new paths to holistic well-being suited to our unique cultural context.
