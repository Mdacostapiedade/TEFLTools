4. Skepticism or Misunderstanding:
   - Provide scientific explanations where possible (e.g., effects on nervous system)
   - Relate practices to familiar concepts (e.g., Qi as similar to local concepts of life force)
   - Encourage experiential learning â€“ let students feel the effects for themselves

5. Maintaining Practice:
   - Set realistic expectations for home practice (start with just 5 minutes daily)
   - Create a buddy system for students to practice together
   - Use mobile apps or text messages for daily practice reminders
