# Lecture Notes

## Natural Breathing Observation

- Importance of breath in Nei Gong practice
  * Foundation for all energy work
  * Connects body, mind, and spirit
  * Improves overall health and vitality

- Diaphragmatic breathing
  * Primary muscle: diaphragm
  * Located at the base of the lungs
  * Contracts and flattens during inhalation
  * Relaxes and domes during exhalation
  * Allows for fuller, deeper breaths

- Observing natural breath
  * Notice rhythm without changing it
  * Pay attention to:
    - Depth of breath
    - Areas of movement (chest, abdomen, sides)
    - Length of inhale vs. exhale
    - Any pauses between breaths
  * Goal: increase awareness, not control

## Concept of Qi

- Definition of Qi
  * Life energy or vital force
  * Flows through all living things
  * Fundamental concept in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)

- Characteristics of Qi
  * Invisible but can be felt
  * Can be cultivated and directed
  * Influences physical and mental health

- Relationship between breath and Qi
  * Breath as a vehicle for Qi
  * Inhalation draws in fresh Qi
  * Exhalation releases stale Qi
  * Proper breathing enhances Qi flow

## Locating the Lower Dantian

- Definition of Dantian
  * Energy center or focal point
  * Three main Dantians: lower, middle, upper
  * Lower Dantian most important for beginners

- Location of lower Dantian
  * Approximately 3 finger-widths below navel
  * 2-3 inches inside the body
  * Also called "sea of Qi" or "elixir field"

- Importance in Nei Gong practice
  * Storing and cultivating Qi
  * Grounding and centering point
  * Focal point for many meditations and exercises
