## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students have difficulty feeling their breath or Dantian.
   **Solution**: Encourage use of gentle touch to bring awareness to these areas. Guide students to place one hand on their abdomen and one on their chest to feel the movement.

2. **Challenge**: Students become sleepy during meditation practices.
   **Solution**: Suggest opening eyes slightly, sitting up straighter, or practicing in a standing position. Ensure the room is well-ventilated.

3. **Challenge**: Cultural or religious concerns about energy practices.
   **Solution**: Frame the practices in terms of health and self-awareness rather than spiritual terms. Be open to discussing concerns and adapting language as needed.

4. **Challenge**: Students with respiratory issues struggling with breath work.
   **Solution**: Offer modifications such as shorter practice durations or focusing on natural breath without trying to deepen it. Encourage students to consult their healthcare provider if concerned.

5. **Challenge**: Maintaining student engagement during theoretical explanations.
   **Solution**: Use analogies relevant to Timorese culture and environment. Incorporate brief, practical exercises to illustrate concepts as you explain them.

6. **Challenge**: Language barriers in understanding key concepts.
   **Solution**: Provide vocabulary lists in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and physical demonstrations to supplement verbal explanations.
