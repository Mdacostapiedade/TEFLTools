1. Small Circulation Meditation (20 minutes)
   - Guide students through a seated meditation focusing on the microcosmic orbit
   - Start with bringing awareness to lower Dantian
   - Gradually guide attention along the pathway, pausing at key points
   - Encourage students to use intention to guide Qi, without forcing

2. Partner Qi Sensing Exercise (20 minutes)
   - Divide class into pairs
   - One partner stands in Wuji posture, the other slowly moves hands near their body
   - Sensing partner describes any sensations of energy or temperature changes
   - Switch roles after 10 minutes

## Production Task (15 minutes)

Students draw their own diagram of the microcosmic orbit pathway, labeling key points in their own words. Encourage them to note any sensations they experienced during the meditation.

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Facilitate brief group discussion on experiences during practice
- Review key points about using intention to guide Qi
- Address any questions or concerns
