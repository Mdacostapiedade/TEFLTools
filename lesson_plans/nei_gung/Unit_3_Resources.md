# Lecture Notes

## Using Yi (Intention) to Guide Qi

- Yi (意) is the focused intention or mind
- Qi (气) is the vital energy or life force
- The relationship between Yi and Qi:
  * "Where the mind goes, the Qi follows" (Yi dao, qi dao)
  * Yi acts as the commander, Qi as the soldier
- Developing Yi:
  * Cultivating a clear, focused mind through meditation
  * Practicing single-pointed concentration
  * Visualizing energy movement in the body
- Techniques for guiding Qi with Yi:
  * Mental focus on specific body areas
  * Visualization of light or warmth moving through meridians
  * Using breath as a vehicle for directing Qi

## Conception and Governing Vessel Pathways

- Microcosmic orbit: primary energy circuit in the body
- Conception Vessel (Ren Mai):
  * Yin channel
  * Runs up the front of the body
  * Begins at perineum, ends at lower lip
  * Associated with nourishing and generating energy
- Governing Vessel (Du Mai):
  * Yang channel
  * Runs up the back of the body
  * Begins at coccyx, ends at upper lip
  * Associated with governing and regulating energy
- Key points along the orbit:
  * Hui Yin (perineum)
  * Qihai (lower dantian, 3 finger widths below navel)
  * Mingmen (gate of life, opposite navel on back)
  * Jizhong (between shoulder blades)
  * Yuzhen (base of skull)
  * Baihui (crown of head)
- Significance in Daoist internal alchemy:
  * Balancing yin and yang energies
  * Refining essence into Qi, Qi into spirit
  * Spiritual development and longevity practices

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the concept of using intention to guide energy compare to practices in traditional Timorese healing or spiritual traditions?

2. In what ways might cultivating awareness of the microcosmic orbit benefit overall health and wellbeing?

3. How can we apply the principle of "Yi dao, qi dao" (where the mind goes, the Qi follows) in daily life outside of formal practice?

4. What challenges did you experience when trying to sense or direct Qi? How might these be overcome with continued practice?

5. How does the microcosmic orbit meditation differ from other forms of meditation you may have practiced before?

6. In what ways might the practice of guiding Qi with intention be relevant or beneficial in your personal or professional life?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Journal Entry

Write a 1-2 page reflective journal entry on your experience with the small circulation meditation and partner Qi sensing exercise. Consider the following points:

1. Describe any physical sensations you noticed during the meditation.
2. What mental or emotional experiences arose during the practice?
3. How did it feel to try sensing Qi with a partner? Were you able to perceive any energy?
4. What challenges did you face in either practice? How did you work with them?
5. How might you incorporate what you learned about Yi and Qi into your daily life?
6. Draw any connections you see between these practices and traditional Timorese concepts of health or spirituality.

# Assignment Details

## Daily Practice and Observation

1. Practice the small circulation meditation for 10-15 minutes each day this week.
2. Keep a daily log of your practice, noting:
   - Time of day and duration of practice
   - Physical sensations experienced
   - Quality of mind (focused, scattered, etc.)
   - Any notable energy movements or blockages felt
   - Overall mood and energy level before and after practice

## Research Project

Research one traditional Timorese practice that may relate to energy cultivation or internal development. This could be a healing method, martial art, spiritual practice, or cultural tradition. Prepare a short (2-3 page) report including:

1. Brief description of the practice
2. Its cultural or historical significance in Timor-Leste
3. Any similarities or parallels you see with Nei Gong concepts or practices
4. How this traditional practice might complement or enhance your Nei Gong training

## Guided Meditation Script: Small Circulation

(To be read slowly, with pauses between instructions)

Find a comfortable seated position, with your spine straight but relaxed. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, allowing your body to settle.

Bring your awareness to your lower abdomen, the area known as the lower dantian. Visualize a warm, golden light gathering in this center.

As you inhale, imagine this light moving down to your perineum, then beginning to travel up your spine.

With each inhale, see and feel the light moving up your back, passing through your sacrum, lower back, between your shoulder blades, to the base of your skull.

As you exhale, the light continues up over the crown of your head, then down your face, throat, and the front of your chest.

Continue following this circulation of light with your breath - up the back on the inhale, down the front on the exhale.

If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the circulation of light and energy.

(Continue guiding for several minutes)

Gradually allow the circulation to slow and come to rest, gathering again at your lower dantian.

Take a few deep breaths, feeling centered and energized.

When you're ready, slowly open your eyes.
