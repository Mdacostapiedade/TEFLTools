   - Systematically relax muscles from head to toe
   - Use breath to help release areas of tightness

3. Sinking and Rooting
   - Cultivate a sense of heaviness in the lower body
   - Imagine roots growing from feet into the earth

4. Cultivating Inner Stillness
   - Quiet the mind by focusing on breath or body sensations
   - Allow thoughts to pass without engagement

5. Sensing Energy Flow
   - Develop awareness of subtle sensations in the body
   - Notice areas of warmth, tingling, or pulsation
