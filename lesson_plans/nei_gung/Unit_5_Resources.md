## Recommended Reading

Excerpt from "The Foundations of Internal Alchemy" by Wang Mu (translated):

"Dao Yin is the art of guiding the Qi and stretching the body. It is like a river that must be dredged to flow smoothly. When the body's channels are open and the Qi flows freely, health and vitality naturally follow. The movements of Dao Yin are not mere physical exercises, but a dance with the very essence of life itself. As you practice, imagine you are a willow tree, bending gracefully in the wind, or a crane, extending its wings with effortless poise. Let nature be your teacher, and your body will remember its innate wisdom."
