## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to coordinate breath with movement
   - **Tip**: Start with very simple, slow movements. Have students practice just the breathing pattern first, then gradually introduce movement.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in sensing or directing Qi
   - **Tip**: Use visualizations (e.g., imagining warm light or water flowing through the body) to help students develop energy awareness.

3. **Challenge**: Cultural resistance to unfamiliar practices
   - **Tip**: Draw parallels between Dao Yin and local traditional practices. Invite respected community members to participate and share their perspectives.

4. **Challenge**: Physical limitations preventing certain movements
   - **Tip**: Offer modifications for all exercises. Emphasize that the internal experience is more important than the external form.

5. **Challenge**: Maintaining student motivation for daily practice
   - **Tip**: Encourage students to form practice groups. Implement a buddy system for accountability. Share success stories and benefits experienced by consistent practitioners.

6. **Challenge**: Integrating Dao Yin into daily Timorese life
   - **Tip**: Suggest ways to incorporate brief practices into daily routines (e.g., morning stretches, breath awareness while walking). Relate Dao Yin principles to local activities like farming or fishing.
