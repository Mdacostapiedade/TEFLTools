## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Cultural Sensitivity:
   - Challenge: Students may be unfamiliar with Chinese philosophical concepts.
   - Solution: Draw parallels to local Timorese traditions and beliefs where possible. Use familiar analogies to explain new concepts.

2. Language Barriers:
   - Challenge: Technical terms may be difficult to translate or understand.
   - Solution: Provide a glossary in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and physical demonstrations to complement verbal explanations.

3. Physical Limitations:
   - Challenge: Some students may have difficulty with certain movements.
   - Solution: Offer modifications for all exercises. Emphasize that internal experience is more important than perfect external form.

4. Emotional Discomfort:
   - Challenge: Focusing on emotions may bring up difficult feelings for some students.
   - Solution: Create a safe, non-judgmental environment. Remind students that they can always return to neutral breathing if they feel overwhelmed.

5. Skepticism:
   - Challenge: Some students may be skeptical about the effectiveness of these practices.
   - Solution: Encourage an experimental attitude. Invite students to notice subtle changes and share positive experiences.

6. Maintaining Practice:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle to maintain regular practice outside of class.
   - Solution: Suggest starting with very short daily sessions. Encourage students to find a practice buddy for accountability.
