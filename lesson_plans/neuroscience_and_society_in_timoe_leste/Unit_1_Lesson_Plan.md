# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Neuroscience and Philosophy of Mind

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Computer with projector
- Handouts with brain diagrams
- Colored pencils or markers for mind mapping
- Copies of relevant book chapters from "Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain" and "The Master and His Emissary"

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe basic brain structure and function
- Explain key concepts in neurotransmission
- Discuss philosophical theories of consciousness
- Analyze the free will debate in neuroscience
- Compare traditional Timorese beliefs about the mind with modern neuroscientific understanding

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Students pair up and discuss the following questions:
- What do you think consciousness is?
- Do you believe in free will? Why or why not?
- How do traditional Timorese beliefs explain the workings of the mind?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Neuron
- Synapse
- Neurotransmitter
- Consciousness
- Free will
- Determinism

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### a. Neuroanatomy Overview (15 minutes)
- Present basic brain structures and their functions
- Discuss the role of neurons and synapses

### b. Neurotransmitters and Synaptic Transmission (10 minutes)
- Explain the process of neurotransmission
- Highlight key neurotransmitters and their effects

### c. Theories of Consciousness (10 minutes)
- Introduce major philosophical and scientific theories of consciousness
- Discuss the hard problem of consciousness

### d. Free Will Debate in Neuroscience (5 minutes)
- Present arguments for and against the existence of free will from a neuroscientific perspective

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### a. Brain Structure Labeling (10 minutes)
Students label major brain structures on a provided diagram

### b. Neurotransmission Role-play (10 minutes)
Students act out the process of synaptic transmission

### c. Consciousness Theory Matching (10 minutes)
Match descriptions of consciousness theories to their names

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

### a. Group Discussion on Traditional Beliefs (20 minutes)
Students discuss traditional Timorese beliefs about the mind and consciousness, comparing them to neuroscientific concepts

### b. Mind Mapping (20 minutes)
Create a mind map of brain regions and their functions

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points from the lesson
- Address any remaining questions
- Preview next lesson on brain lateralization

## 9. Homework Assignment

Read the assigned chapter from "The Master and His Emissary" and write a one-page reflection on how brain lateralization might influence Timorese culture and society.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Neuron: The basic functional unit of the nervous system, specialized for transmitting information.
- Synapse: The junction between two neurons where information is transmitted.
- Neurotransmitter: Chemical messengers that transmit signals across synapses.
- Consciousness: The state of being aware of and able to think about one's own thoughts and experiences.
- Free will: The ability to make choices that are not predetermined or caused by external factors.
- Determinism: The philosophical idea that all events are determined by previously existing causes.
