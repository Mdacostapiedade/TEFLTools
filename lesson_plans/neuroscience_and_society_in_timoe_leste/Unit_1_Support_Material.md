# Support Material for Introduction to Neuroscience and Philosophy of Mind

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Neuron**: The basic functional unit of the nervous system, specialized for transmitting information.
- **Synapse**: The junction between two neurons where information is transmitted.
- **Neurotransmitter**: Chemical messengers that transmit signals across synapses.
- **Consciousness**: The state of being aware of and able to think about one's own thoughts and experiences.
- **Free will**: The ability to make choices that are not predetermined or caused by external factors.
- **Determinism**: The philosophical idea that all events are determined by previously existing causes.
- **Cerebral cortex**: The outer layer of the brain responsible for higher-order functions like thinking and decision-making.
- **Limbic system**: A group of brain structures involved in emotion, memory, and motivation.
- **Neuroplasticity**: The brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience.
- **Qualia**: Individual instances of subjective, conscious experience.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Basic Brain Structure Diagram**: A labeled cross-section of the human brain showing major structures (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, limbic system).

2. **Neuron Diagram**: A detailed illustration of a neuron, labeling key parts (cell body, axon, dendrites, myelin sheath).

3. **Synaptic Transmission Infographic**: A step-by-step visual representation of neurotransmitter release and reception at a synapse.

4. **Consciousness Theories Mind Map**: A visual representation of major theories of consciousness, including their key proponents and main ideas.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Brain Structure Labeling Activity**: A blank diagram of the brain for students to label major structures and their functions.

2. **Neurotransmission Flowchart**: A partially completed flowchart of the synaptic transmission process for students to fill in.

3. **Consciousness Theory Matching Exercise**: A two-column worksheet with descriptions of consciousness theories in one column and their names in another for students to match.

4. **Free Will Debate Organizer**: A graphic organizer for students to list arguments for and against the existence of free will from a neuroscientific perspective.

5. **Traditional Beliefs Comparison Chart**: A chart for students to compare traditional Timorese beliefs about the mind with modern neuroscientific understanding.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Consciousness: A Very Short Introduction" by Susan Blackmore
2. "The Brain: The Story of You" by David Eagleman
3. Online course: "Medical Neuroscience" on Coursera by Duke University
4. Interactive Brain Atlas: https://www.brainfacts.org/3d-brain
5. Podcast: "Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD"
6. Video series: "Crash Course Psychology" on YouTube (episodes on the brain and consciousness)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with the complexity of brain anatomy.
   **Solution**: Use analogies and real-world examples to make concepts more relatable. For instance, compare the brain's structure to a company's organizational chart.

2. **Challenge**: The philosophical concepts of consciousness and free will can be abstract and confusing.
   **Solution**: Encourage personal reflection and relate these concepts to everyday experiences. Use thought experiments to illustrate key points.

3. **Challenge**: Students may have difficulty reconciling traditional beliefs with scientific explanations.
   **Solution**: Approach the topic with cultural sensitivity. Emphasize that scientific understanding complements rather than replaces cultural wisdom.

4. **Challenge**: The neurotransmission process can be complex and hard to visualize.
   **Solution**: Use the role-play activity to make the process more tangible. Consider using online animations or simulations to supplement the explanation.

5. **Challenge**: Students may have varying levels of prior knowledge about brain function.
   **Solution**: Conduct a pre-assessment to gauge students' understanding. Provide additional resources for those who need extra support or more advanced material for those who are ahead.

6. **Challenge**: Engaging students in discussions about abstract concepts.
   **Solution**: Use real-life scenarios or case studies to make discussions more concrete. Encourage students to relate the concepts to their own experiences or observations.
