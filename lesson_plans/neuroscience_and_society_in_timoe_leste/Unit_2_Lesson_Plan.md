# Lesson Plan: Lateralization of Brain Function

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with brain diagrams
- Computer and projector for presentations
- "The Master and His Emissary" by Iain McGilchrist (selected chapters)
- Simple materials for hemispheric specialization experiments (e.g., paper, pencils, puzzles)
- Examples of Timorese art and cultural artifacts

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the concept of hemispheric specialization
- Describe key functions associated with left and right brain hemispheres
- Understand the basics of language lateralization
- Discuss how brain lateralization may influence cognition and behavior
- Analyze potential connections between brain lateralization and Timorese art/culture

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick draw: Students draw an object twice, once with their dominant hand and once with their non-dominant hand
- Discuss the differences in their drawings and introduce the concept of hemispheric specialization

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Lateralization
- Hemispheric specialization
- Corpus callosum
- Language centers (Broca's area, Wernicke's area)
- Spatial processing

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of brain structure and hemispheres
- Left hemisphere functions: language, logical reasoning, sequential processing
- Right hemisphere functions: spatial awareness, emotional processing, holistic thinking
- Language lateralization and its exceptions
- Spatial processing and creativity in the right hemisphere
- Brief introduction to McGilchrist's theory from "The Master and His Emissary"

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Conduct simple experiments to demonstrate hemispheric specialization:
  * Dichotic listening test
  * Visual field test
  * Spatial rotation tasks
- Students work in pairs to complete and discuss results

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

- Group discussion: Analyze examples of Timorese art and cultural artifacts
- Debate: "How might brain lateralization influence Timorese art and culture?"
- Create mind maps illustrating potential connections between brain lateralization and cultural expressions

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key concepts
- Open discussion: What surprised you most about brain lateralization?
- Preview next lesson on decision-making neuroscience

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Read selected chapters from "The Master and His Emissary"
- Write a 500-word reflection on how brain lateralization might influence daily life in Timor-Leste
- Prepare a brief presentation on a chosen aspect of Timorese culture, hypothesizing how it might relate to brain lateralization

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Lateralization: The localization of functions in the right or left hemispheres of the brain
- Hemispheric specialization: The idea that certain cognitive processes are predominantly associated with one brain hemisphere
- Corpus callosum: The bundle of nerve fibers connecting the two cerebral hemispheres
- Broca's area: A region in the frontal lobe of the dominant hemisphere, involved in speech production
- Wernicke's area: A region in the temporal lobe of the dominant hemisphere, involved in language comprehension
- Spatial processing: The ability to understand and manipulate visual representations of objects in space
