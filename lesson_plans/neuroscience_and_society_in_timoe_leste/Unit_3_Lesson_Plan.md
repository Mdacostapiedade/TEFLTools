# Lesson Plan: Neuroscience of Decision-Making

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts on reward pathways in the brain
- Case study materials on Timorese community leadership
- Role-play scenario cards

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the basic neural mechanisms involved in decision-making
- Describe how emotions influence decision-making processes
- Analyze cultural influences on decision-making in Timor-Leste
- Apply neuroscience concepts to real-world decision-making scenarios

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick decision-making game: Present students with a series of rapid-fire "Would you rather?" questions, asking them to make quick decisions and raise their hands for their choices.
- Brief discussion on how they made these decisions and what factors influenced them.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Reward pathway
- Dopamine
- Prefrontal cortex
- Amygdala
- Cultural neuroscience

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of neural mechanisms in decision-making:
  * Role of the prefrontal cortex in executive function
  * Reward pathways and dopamine release
- Emotional influences on decision-making:
  * Amygdala's role in processing emotions
  * How emotions can override rational thinking
- Cultural neuroscience perspectives:
  * How cultural background shapes neural pathways
  * Examples of cultural differences in decision-making processes

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- Small group discussions:
  * Analyze provided examples of decision-making scenarios
  * Identify potential neural mechanisms and emotional influences involved
- Whole class sharing and discussion of findings

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

- Case study analysis:
  * In groups, students analyze a case study of decision-making in Timorese community leadership
  * Identify cultural, emotional, and neural factors influencing the decision-making process
- Role-play exercise:
  * Students act out scenarios demonstrating cultural differences in decision-making
  * Class discusses observations and connections to neuroscience concepts

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Open discussion on how understanding the neuroscience of decision-making could be applied in Timorese society

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students write a reflective essay (500 words) on how cultural factors might influence their own decision-making processes, incorporating neuroscience concepts learned in class.
- Read the provided article on cultural neuroscience and prepare three discussion questions for the next class.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Reward pathway: A group of neural structures responsible for motivation, associative learning, and positive emotions.
- Dopamine: A neurotransmitter that plays a major role in reward-motivated behavior.
- Prefrontal cortex: The cerebral cortex covering the front part of the frontal lobe, involved in planning complex cognitive behavior and decision-making.
- Amygdala: A group of nuclei located deep within the temporal lobes, involved in processing emotions and emotional memories.
- Cultural neuroscience: An interdisciplinary field studying how cultural values, practices, and beliefs shape and are shaped by the mind, brain, and genes.
