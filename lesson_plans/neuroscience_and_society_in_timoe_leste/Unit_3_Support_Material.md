Here's the support material for the lesson plan on the Neuroscience of Decision-Making, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Neuroscience of Decision-Making Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Reward pathway**: A group of neural structures responsible for motivation, associative learning, and positive emotions.
- **Dopamine**: A neurotransmitter that plays a major role in reward-motivated behavior.
- **Prefrontal cortex**: The cerebral cortex covering the front part of the frontal lobe, involved in planning complex cognitive behavior and decision-making.
- **Amygdala**: A group of nuclei located deep within the temporal lobes, involved in processing emotions and emotional memories.
- **Cultural neuroscience**: An interdisciplinary field studying how cultural values, practices, and beliefs shape and are shaped by the mind, brain, and genes.
- **Executive function**: A set of cognitive processes that enable planning, focus, remembering instructions, and juggling multiple tasks successfully.
- **Neuroplasticity**: The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Brain Diagram: A simplified diagram of the human brain highlighting the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and reward pathway structures (e.g., nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area).

2. Decision-Making Flowchart: A flowchart illustrating the process of decision-making, including inputs (sensory information, emotions, memories), processing (prefrontal cortex activity), and outputs (choices, actions).

3. Cultural Influence Diagram: A visual representation showing how cultural factors (e.g., values, traditions, social norms) interact with neural mechanisms in decision-making.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Reward Pathway Handout:
   - Diagram of the reward pathway
   - Brief explanation of each component's role
   - Examples of how the reward pathway influences decision-making

2. Case Study Worksheet:
   - Background information on a Timorese community leadership scenario
   - Questions prompting students to identify cultural, emotional, and neural factors influencing decision-making
   - Space for students to propose alternative decisions based on neuroscience insights

3. Role-Play Scenario Cards:
   - Set of cards describing different decision-making scenarios in various cultural contexts
   - Prompts for students to consider how cultural background might influence neural processes and decision outcomes

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling to connect neuroscience concepts to real-world scenarios.
   Tip: Use relatable examples from Timorese daily life to illustrate neuroscience principles. Encourage students to share personal experiences and relate them to the concepts being discussed.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in understanding complex neural mechanisms.
   Tip: Use analogies and metaphors to explain abstract concepts. For example, compare the prefrontal cortex to a conductor orchestrating different brain regions.

3. Challenge: Balancing cultural sensitivity with scientific discussion.
   Tip: Acknowledge the value of traditional beliefs while presenting scientific evidence. Encourage open dialogue about how cultural practices might align with or differ from neuroscientific findings.

4. Challenge: Engaging students in discussions about cultural influences on decision-making.
   Tip: Use think-pair-share activities to encourage all students to participate. Provide prompts that relate to students' personal experiences with cultural differences in decision-making.

5. Challenge: Limited access to neuroscience resources in Timor-Leste.
   Tip: Develop a resource-sharing system among teachers and students. Encourage the use of open-access online resources and adapt materials to the local context when necessary.
