# Lesson Plan: Memory and Learning in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts on types of memory and neuroplasticity
- Traditional Timorese objects or images for memory exercise
- Interview guidelines for elder interviews

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the different types of memory and their functions
- Describe the concept of neuroplasticity and its role in learning
- Compare traditional Timorese learning practices with modern neuroscience principles
- Design a culturally relevant learning activity based on neuroscience concepts

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Memory game: Display 10 traditional Timorese objects or images for 30 seconds, then remove them. Have students write down as many items as they can remember.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Short-term memory
- Long-term memory
- Procedural memory
- Neuroplasticity
- Cultural transmission

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Types of memory:
  * Short-term memory: temporary storage of information
  * Long-term memory: enduring storage of information
  * Procedural memory: unconscious memory for skills and procedures
- Neuroplasticity:
  * Definition: the brain's ability to change and adapt
  * Importance in learning and memory formation
- Cultural transmission of knowledge in Timor-Leste:
  * Traditional oral storytelling
  * Apprenticeship in crafts and skills
  * Ritual and ceremonial learning

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- Group discussion: Compare and contrast modern educational practices with traditional Timorese learning methods
- Pair work: Create a Venn diagram showing similarities and differences between Western and Timorese approaches to memory and learning

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

In small groups, design a learning activity that incorporates:
- A specific type of memory (short-term, long-term, or procedural)
- Principles of neuroplasticity
- Elements of Timorese culture or traditional knowledge

Groups will present their activities to the class.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Class discussion on how understanding memory and learning can benefit Timorese society

## 9. Homework Assignment

Interview an elder in your community about traditional memory techniques or learning practices. Prepare a 5-minute presentation on your findings, relating them to the neuroscience concepts discussed in class.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Short-term memory: The capacity to hold a small amount of information in an active, readily available state for a short period.
- Long-term memory: The storage of information over an extended period, potentially for a lifetime.
- Procedural memory: A type of long-term memory that involves unconscious recall of skills and procedures.
- Neuroplasticity: The ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization.
- Cultural transmission: The process by which cultural elements, such as ideas, language, or behavior, are passed from person to person within a community.
