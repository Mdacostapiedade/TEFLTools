# Lesson Plan: Neuroscience of Emotion and Social Behavior in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Printed handouts of Timorese folklore stories
- Colored pencils and large sheets of paper for emotion mapping
- Access to online resources for cross-cultural emotion research

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the basic functions of the limbic system in emotion regulation
- Describe the role of mirror neurons in empathy and social cognition
- Analyze cultural variations in emotional expression between Timorese and Western cultures
- Identify emotional themes and social norms in Timorese folklore

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display a series of facial expressions showing different emotions
- Ask students to identify the emotions and discuss any cultural differences they notice in how these emotions are expressed

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Limbic system
- Amygdala
- Mirror neurons
- Empathy
- Cultural neuroscience
- Emotional regulation

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of the limbic system and its role in emotion regulation
- Explanation of mirror neurons and their function in empathy and social cognition
- Discussion of cultural variations in emotional expression, with examples from Timorese and Western cultures

## 6. Practice Activities (25 minutes)

- Small group activity: Students analyze short Timorese folklore stories to identify emotional themes and social norms
- Class discussion: Share findings and compare with Western stories

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- In pairs, students create a cultural emotion map comparing Timorese and Western emotional expressions
- Each pair presents their map to the class, explaining key differences and similarities

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Open discussion on how understanding cultural differences in emotion can improve social interactions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a short essay (500 words) on a traditional Timorese practice or ritual related to emotional expression or social behavior
- Analyze how this practice relates to concepts learned in class about the neuroscience of emotion and social behavior

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Limbic system: A set of brain structures involved in emotional processing and regulation
- Amygdala: A part of the limbic system crucial for processing emotions, especially fear and aggression
- Mirror neurons: Brain cells that fire both when an animal performs an action and when it observes the same action performed by another
- Empathy: The ability to understand and share the feelings of another
- Cultural neuroscience: An interdisciplinary field studying how cultural experiences shape the brain
- Emotional regulation: The ability to manage and respond to an emotional experience
