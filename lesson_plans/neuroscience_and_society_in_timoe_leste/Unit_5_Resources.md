## 1. Timorese Folklore Excerpts

### The Legend of the Crocodile

Long ago, a young boy found a small crocodile trapped in a net. Taking pity on the creature, he freed it and carried it to the river. The crocodile, grateful for the boy's kindness, offered to take him on a journey across the sea. As they traveled, the crocodile grew larger and stronger. When they reached the other side, the crocodile said, "My friend, I have become an island for you and your people. I will always protect you." This is how the island of Timor was formed, shaped like a crocodile to remember the friendship between the boy and the creature.

### The Tale of the Sacred Water Buffalo

In a small village, there lived a poor farmer who owned a single water buffalo. One day, the buffalo spoke to him, revealing it was a magical creature. The buffalo instructed the farmer to follow it into the forest. There, they discovered a hidden spring with crystal-clear water. The buffalo told the farmer to share this water with the village, as it had healing properties. The farmer did as he was told, and soon the village prospered. From that day on, water buffaloes were considered sacred animals, symbols of wisdom and generosity.

## 2. Lecture Notes

### Limbic System and Emotion Regulation

- The limbic system: A group of interconnected structures in the brain
  - Key components: Amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus
- Amygdala: Central to processing emotions, especially fear and aggression
  - Receives sensory input and triggers emotional responses
  - Crucial for emotional memory formation
- Hippocampus: Important for memory consolidation and spatial navigation
  - Connects emotions to memories
- Hypothalamus: Regulates hormones and basic drives (hunger, thirst, sleep)
- Emotion regulation:
  - Involves multiple brain regions working together
  - Prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in modulating limbic system activity
  - Cultural influences on emotion regulation strategies

### Mirror Neurons and Empathy

- Mirror neurons: Brain cells that fire both when performing an action and observing it
  - Discovered in macaque monkeys, evidence for similar system in humans
- Functions of mirror neurons:
  - Action understanding
  - Imitation learning
  - Empathy and social cognition
- Empathy: The ability to understand and share feelings of others
  - Cognitive empathy: Understanding others' mental states
  - Emotional empathy: Sharing others' emotional experiences
- Mirror neuron system and empathy:
  - Facilitates understanding of others' actions and intentions
  - May contribute to emotional contagion and shared experiences
- Cultural variations in empathy expression and interpretation

### Cultural Variations in Emotional Expression

- Universality vs. cultural specificity of emotions
  - Basic emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger) recognized across cultures
  - Cultural differences in display rules and interpretation
- Collectivist vs. individualist cultures:
  - Influence on emotional expression and regulation
  - Timor-Leste: Predominantly collectivist culture
- High-context vs. low-context communication:
  - Impact on nonverbal emotional cues
  - Timor-Leste: High-context communication style
- Cultural neuroscience findings:
  - Brain activation differences in emotion processing across cultures
  - Influence of cultural values on neural responses to emotional stimuli
- Emotional vocabulary and concepts across cultures:
  - Unique emotion words in different languages (e.g., "saudade" in Portuguese)
  - Implications for emotional experiences and expression

## 3. Discussion Questions

1. How might the limbic system's role in emotion regulation be influenced by Timorese cultural practices and beliefs?
2. In what ways could the concept of mirror neurons help explain traditional Timorese social norms and behaviors?
3. Compare and contrast emotional expression in Timorese culture with that of Western cultures. What are some key differences and similarities?
4. How do the Timorese folklore stories we analyzed reflect cultural attitudes towards emotions and social behavior?
5. Discuss potential challenges in applying Western neuroscientific concepts of emotion to Timorese culture. How can we bridge these cultural differences?
6. How might understanding cultural variations in emotional expression improve cross-cultural communication and empathy?
7. In what ways could the study of cultural neuroscience benefit Timorese society and its development?

## 4. Writing Exercise Instructions

### Cultural Emotion Map

1. Divide a large sheet of paper into two sections: "Timorese Culture" and "Western Culture"
2. In each section, list at least 5 common emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise)
3. For each emotion, describe:
   - Typical facial expressions
   - Body language
   - Verbal expressions
   - Social contexts where the emotion is commonly expressed
   - Any cultural taboos or restrictions on expressing the emotion
4. Use colored pencils to illustrate key differences visually
5. Add notes on how these differences might be explained by cultural values or historical factors
6. Prepare a short presentation (3-5 minutes) explaining your map to the class

### Cultural Display Rules Comparison Chart

| Emotion | Timorese Culture | Western Culture |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| Happiness | Open expression, shared with community | Individual expression, may be more reserved |
| Sadness | Often expressed privately or with close family | More openly expressed, seeking support |
| Anger | Indirect expression, conflict avoidance | More direct expression, confrontational |
| Fear | Communal support sought, spiritual explanations | Individual coping, rational explanations sought |
| Pride | Modesty emphasized, group achievements valued | Individual accomplishments celebrated |
