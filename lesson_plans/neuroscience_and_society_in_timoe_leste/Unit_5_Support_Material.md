Here's the support material for the lesson plan on "Neuroscience of Emotion and Social Behavior in Timor-Leste," formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Limbic system**: A set of brain structures involved in emotional processing and regulation
- **Amygdala**: A part of the limbic system crucial for processing emotions, especially fear and aggression
- **Mirror neurons**: Brain cells that fire both when an animal performs an action and when it observes the same action performed by another
- **Empathy**: The ability to understand and share the feelings of another
- **Cultural neuroscience**: An interdisciplinary field studying how cultural experiences shape the brain
- **Emotional regulation**: The ability to manage and respond to an emotional experience
- **Social cognition**: The mental processes involved in perceiving, understanding, and interacting with others
- **Facial expressions**: Movements of facial muscles to convey emotional states
- **Cultural norms**: Shared expectations and rules that guide behavior of people within a society
- **Folklore**: Traditional stories, customs, and beliefs passed down through generations

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Limbic System Diagram**: A simple illustration of the brain highlighting the key structures of the limbic system, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex.

2. **Facial Expression Chart**: A grid showing various facial expressions associated with different emotions, including both universal expressions and culturally specific ones from Timor-Leste.

3. **Mirror Neuron Infographic**: A visual representation of how mirror neurons work, showing the same brain areas activating when performing an action and when observing it.

4. **Cultural Emotion Map**: A template for students to fill in, comparing emotional expressions between Timorese and Western cultures across different scenarios.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Timorese Folklore Analysis Sheet**: 
   - Title of the story
   - Main characters
   - Emotional themes identified
   - Social norms portrayed
   - Comparison to Western equivalents

2. **Emotion Regulation Strategies Worksheet**:
   - List of common emotions
   - Columns for Timorese and Western regulation strategies
   - Space for students to reflect on cultural differences

3. **Mirror Neuron and Empathy Exercise**:
   - Scenarios describing social interactions
   - Questions prompting students to identify empathetic responses
   - Discussion points on cultural variations in empathy expression

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Cultural Neuroscience: Cultural Influences on Brain Function" by Joan Y. Chiao
2. "The Cultural Context of Health, Illness, and Medicine" by Elisa J. Sobo and Martha O. Loustaunau
3. Online course: "Culture, Emotion, and Expression" on edX
4. TED Talk: "How Culture Shapes Emotions" by Batja Mesquita
5. Research paper: "Cultural Variation in Emotion Perception and Expression" by David Matsumoto

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language barriers**: 
   - Challenge: Students may struggle with scientific terminology.
   - Solution: Provide a glossary of terms in both English and Tetum, and use visual aids to reinforce concepts.

2. **Cultural sensitivity**: 
   - Challenge: Discussing emotional expressions may be uncomfortable in some cultures.
   - Solution: Create a safe, respectful environment and allow students to share at their comfort level.

3. **Limited prior knowledge**: 
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of neuroscience background.
   - Solution: Begin with a brief review of basic brain anatomy and function.

4. **Balancing Western and Timorese perspectives**: 
   - Challenge: Ensuring equal representation of both cultures.
   - Solution: Actively seek out Timorese examples and encourage students to share their experiences.

5. **Engaging with abstract concepts**: 
   - Challenge: Some neuroscience concepts may be difficult to grasp.
   - Solution: Use hands-on activities, role-playing, and real-life examples to make concepts more concrete.

6. **Technology limitations**: 
   - Challenge: Limited access to digital resources in some areas.
   - Solution: Prepare printable versions of all materials and have offline alternatives for activities.
