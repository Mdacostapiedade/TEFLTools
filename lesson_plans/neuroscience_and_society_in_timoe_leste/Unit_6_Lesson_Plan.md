# Lesson Plan: Neuroethics and Society in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Copies of selected chapters from "The Master and His Emissary" by Iain McGilchrist
- "Neuroethics: An Introduction with Readings" by Martha J. Farah
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on neuroethics case studies
- Flip charts and markers for group work

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define key concepts in neuroethics
- Identify ethical implications of neuroscientific advances
- Analyze potential applications and challenges of neurotechnology in Timorese society
- Develop guidelines for ethical neuroscience research in Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Students reflect on the question "How might advances in neuroscience affect Timorese society?" for 2 minutes, then discuss with a partner for 3 minutes, and finally share ideas with the class for 5 minutes.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  - Neuroethics
  - Cognitive liberty
  - Neuroenhancement
  - Brain-computer interface
  - Neuroimaging
- Students create a vocabulary mind map in small groups

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Lecture on core neuroethics topics:
  - Overview of neuroethics and its importance
  - Neuroenhancement and cognitive liberty
  - Privacy concerns with brain data
  - Applications of neuroscience in education and law
- Use examples relevant to Timorese context throughout the presentation

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

- Case study analysis: Students work in small groups to analyze ethical dilemmas related to neuroscience applications in Timor-Leste (e.g., using neurotechnology in schools, brain scans in criminal cases)
- Gallery walk: Groups create posters summarizing their case study analyses and rotate to view and comment on other groups' work

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Debate: Class divides into two teams to debate the use of neurotechnology in Timorese schools
- Guidelines development: In small groups, students draft initial guidelines for ethical neuroscience research in Timor-Leste

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion: Key takeaways from the debate and guidelines development
- Quick quiz: Students answer multiple-choice questions on key neuroethics concepts

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Read the article "Neuroethics for the Developing World" and write a 500-word reflection on how the ideas presented could be applied in Timor-Leste
- Begin research for the "Brain Awareness Week" event project

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Neuroethics: The study of ethical, legal, and social implications of neuroscience research and applications
- Cognitive liberty: The right to mental self-determination and freedom of thought
- Neuroenhancement: The use of neurotechnology to improve cognitive or mental functions
- Brain-computer interface: A direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device
- Neuroimaging: Techniques for visualizing brain structure and function, such as fMRI or EEG
