# Support Material for Neuroethics and Society in Timor-Leste Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Neuroethics: The study of ethical, legal, and social implications of neuroscience research and applications
- Cognitive liberty: The right to mental self-determination and freedom of thought
- Neuroenhancement: The use of neurotechnology to improve cognitive or mental functions
- Brain-computer interface: A direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device
- Neuroimaging: Techniques for visualizing brain structure and function, such as fMRI or EEG
- Cognitive privacy: The protection of personal thoughts and mental processes from unauthorized access or manipulation
- Neurodiversity: The concept that neurological differences are natural variations in the human brain rather than disorders
- Neurolaw: The application of neuroscience findings to legal matters and policy-making

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Neuroethics Mind Map:
   A central circle labeled "Neuroethics" with branches extending to:
   - "Privacy Concerns"
   - "Cognitive Enhancement"
   - "Brain-Computer Interfaces"
   - "Neurolaw"
   - "Cultural Considerations"
   Each branch has sub-branches with relevant topics or issues.

2. Ethical Decision-Making Framework:
   A flowchart diagram showing steps for ethical decision-making in neuroscience:
   1. Identify the ethical issue
   2. Gather relevant information
   3. Consider cultural context
   4. Evaluate potential consequences
   5. Consult stakeholders
   6. Make a decision
   7. Reflect and reassess

3. Neurotechnology Applications in Timor-Leste:
   A visual representation of potential applications, such as:
   - Education: Brain-based learning techniques
   - Healthcare: Neurofeedback for mental health
   - Agriculture: Brain-computer interfaces for precision farming
   - Cultural preservation: Neuroimaging studies of traditional practices

   - Ethical considerations (list 3-5)
   - Potential benefits for Timorese society
   - Potential risks or challenges
   - Cultural factors to consider
   - Proposed guidelines or recommendations

2. Neuroethics Debate Preparation Sheet:
   - Topic: "Should neurotechnology be used in Timorese schools?"
   - Pro arguments (list 3-5)
   - Con arguments (list 3-5)
   - Evidence to support each side
   - Potential rebuttals

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited background knowledge in neuroscience
   Solution: Provide brief, accessible introductions to key neuroscience concepts. Use analogies and real-world examples relevant to Timorese culture.

2. Challenge: Difficulty relating neuroethics to local context
   Solution: Encourage students to brainstorm potential applications of neurotechnology in Timor-Leste. Invite local experts or community leaders to discuss cultural perspectives.

3. Challenge: Language barriers in understanding technical terms
   Solution: Create a bilingual glossary (English and Tetum) of key terms. Use visual aids and hands-on activities to reinforce concepts.

4. Challenge: Engaging students in ethical debates
   Solution: Use role-playing exercises and real-world case studies to make discussions more concrete and relatable.

5. Challenge: Balancing Western scientific perspectives with traditional Timorese beliefs
   Solution: Encourage open dialogue about different worldviews. Emphasize the importance of cultural sensitivity in applying neuroscientific knowledge.

6. Challenge: Limited access to up-to-date neurotechnology
   Solution: Use videos, simulations, and virtual labs to demonstrate neurotechnology applications. Focus on conceptual understanding rather than hands-on experience with advanced equipment.

7. Challenge: Addressing sensitive topics (e.g., mental health stigma)
   Solution: Create a safe, respectful classroom environment. Provide anonymous ways for students to ask questions or express concerns.
