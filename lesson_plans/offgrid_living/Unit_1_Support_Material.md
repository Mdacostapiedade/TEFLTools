## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barriers:
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of proficiency in the language of instruction.
   - Solution: Use visual aids extensively, provide key terms in both English and Tetum, and encourage peer translation.

2. Limited Technology Access:
   - Challenge: Some students may not have experience with computers or internet for research.
   - Solution: Prepare printed resources and encourage group work to share access to digital resources.

3. Varying Levels of Prior Knowledge:
   - Challenge: Students may have different levels of familiarity with environmental concepts.
   - Solution: Start with basic definitions and use the warm-up activity to gauge understanding. Adjust the lesson pace accordingly.

4. Cultural Sensitivity:
   - Challenge: Some traditional practices may be sacred or sensitive topics.
   - Solution: Research local customs beforehand and invite a community elder to guide discussions on traditional practices.

5. Practical Application Concerns:
   - Challenge: Students may doubt the feasibility of off-grid living in their context.
   - Solution: Provide concrete, local examples of successful off-grid projects and emphasize gradual implementation of concepts.

6. Engagement with Mapping Activity:
   - Challenge: Some students may struggle with the abstract nature of resource mapping.
   - Solution: Start with a simple example as a class, then move to small groups. Provide clear criteria for what to include on the maps.
