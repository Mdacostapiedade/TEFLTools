# Lesson Plan: Renewable Energy Systems in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Solar power demonstration kit
- Handouts with diagrams of solar power systems
- Energy audit worksheets
- Laptops or tablets for research (if available)
- Projector and screen for presentations
- Samples of solar panels, batteries, and inverters

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify renewable energy options suitable for Timor-Leste
- Explain the basic components and function of a solar power system
- Conduct a simple energy audit
- Demonstrate the assembly of a basic solar power kit

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Brainstorming session: Students list all the ways they use energy in their daily lives
- Discuss which of these energy uses could be powered by renewable sources

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Renewable energy
- Solar power
- Micro-hydro
- Biomass energy
- Photovoltaic (PV) cells
- Inverter
- Battery bank
- Energy conservation

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of renewable energy options in Timor-Leste:
  * Solar potential in the country
  * Micro-hydro opportunities in mountainous regions
  * Biomass energy from agricultural waste
- Detailed explanation of solar power systems:
  * How solar panels work
  * Components of a solar power system (panels, batteries, inverter, charge controller)
  * Sizing a system for different needs

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

- Small group activity: Students research and present on either micro-hydro or biomass energy potential in Timor-Leste
- Guided practice: Walk through the components of the solar power demonstration kit

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Hands-on workshop: Students work in pairs to assemble a small solar power kit
- Energy audit exercise: Students conduct a basic energy audit of the classroom or a nearby building

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Q&A session to address any questions about the lesson content
- Quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students complete a home energy audit and propose three energy conservation measures
- Research and write a one-page report on a successful renewable energy project in a developing country similar to Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Renewable energy: Energy from sources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale
- Solar power: Conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity
- Micro-hydro: Small-scale hydroelectric power systems typically providing power to a small community or rural area
- Biomass energy: Energy produced by burning organic materials from plants and animals
- Photovoltaic (PV) cells: Devices that convert light into electrical current
- Inverter: Device that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC)
- Battery bank: Group of batteries connected together to store electrical energy
- Energy conservation: Reducing energy consumption through efficient use and decreased waste
