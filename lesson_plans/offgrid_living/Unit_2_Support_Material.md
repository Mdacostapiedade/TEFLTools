# Support Material for Renewable Energy Systems in Timor-Leste Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Renewable energy: Energy from sources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale
- Solar power: Conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity
- Micro-hydro: Small-scale hydroelectric power systems typically providing power to a small community or rural area
- Biomass energy: Energy produced by burning organic materials from plants and animals
- Photovoltaic (PV) cells: Devices that convert light into electrical current
- Inverter: Device that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC)
- Battery bank: Group of batteries connected together to store electrical energy
- Energy conservation: Reducing energy consumption through efficient use and decreased waste
- Charge controller: Device that regulates the voltage and current coming from solar panels to the battery
- Grid-tied system: Solar power system connected to the main electricity grid
- Off-grid system: Stand-alone power system not connected to the main electricity grid

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Limited access to technology:
   - Prepare printed materials and physical demonstrations as alternatives to digital resources
   - Encourage group work to share available devices

2. Language barriers:
   - Provide key terms in both English and Tetum
   - Use visual aids and hands-on activities to reinforce concepts

3. Varying levels of prior knowledge:
   - Begin with a brief assessment to gauge students' understanding
   - Pair students with different knowledge levels for peer learning

4. Limited practical experience:
   - Prioritize hands-on activities and real-world examples
   - Invite local experts or practitioners for guest presentations

5. Cultural considerations:
   - Incorporate traditional Timorese practices related to energy use and conservation
   - Discuss how renewable energy can complement, not replace, valued cultural practices

6. Safety concerns with electrical components:
   - Review basic electrical safety before hands-on activities
   - Provide close supervision during practical exercises
   - Use low-voltage demonstration kits when possible
