# Lesson Plan: Water Management and Conservation in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Local rainfall data charts
- Samples of local water filtration materials (sand, gravel, charcoal)
- PVC pipes, gutters, and barrel for rainwater harvesting demonstration
- Handouts on water conservation techniques

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the importance of water management in Timor-Leste's context
- Describe basic rainwater harvesting techniques
- Understand the principles of natural water purification
- Design a simple rainwater harvesting system
- Construct a basic bio-sand water filter

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Group brainstorming: List all the ways water is used in daily life in Timor-Leste
- Discuss how water availability changes during dry and wet seasons

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Rainwater harvesting
- Catchment area
- First flush diverter
- Bio-sand filter
- Greywater
- Water conservation

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Rainwater Harvesting
- Explain the concept and benefits of rainwater harvesting
- Show diagrams of basic rainwater harvesting systems
- Discuss components: gutters, downpipes, first flush diverters, storage tanks

### Natural Water Purification
- Introduce bio-sand filtration principles
- Explain layers in a bio-sand filter: gravel, sand, and biological layer
- Discuss other natural purification methods: solar disinfection, ceramic filters

### Water Conservation Strategies
- Present local water scarcity issues
- Introduce water-saving techniques for households and agriculture
- Explain greywater recycling concepts for gardens

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### Activity 1: Rainwater Harvesting Calculation
- In pairs, students calculate potential rainwater harvest from a local building's roof
- Provide roof dimensions and local rainfall data

### Activity 2: Bio-sand Filter Assembly
- In small groups, students assemble a small-scale bio-sand filter using provided materials
- Guide students through the layering process and explain each component's function

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

### Task 1: Design a Rainwater Harvesting System
- Students individually design a basic rainwater harvesting system for a local building
- Include sketches, materials list, and brief explanation of the system

### Task 2: Water Conservation Plan
- In groups, students create a water conservation plan for a typical Timorese household
- Present plans to the class, discussing feasibility and potential challenges

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points of water management and conservation
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Brief discussion on how these techniques can benefit local communities

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and document traditional Timorese water management practices
- Design a public awareness poster on water conservation for the local community

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Rainwater harvesting: The collection and storage of rainwater for reuse
- Catchment area: The surface area from which rainwater is collected, typically a roof
- First flush diverter: A device that diverts the initial, often contaminated, rainwater away from the storage tank
- Bio-sand filter: A point-of-use water treatment system using layers of sand and gravel to remove contaminants
- Greywater: Wastewater from household uses like laundry or dishwashing, excluding toilet waste
- Water conservation: The practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage
