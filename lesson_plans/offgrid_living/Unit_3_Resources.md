# Lecture Notes

## Rainwater Harvesting

### Introduction
- Definition: Rainwater harvesting is the collection and storage of rainwater for reuse on-site, rather than allowing it to run off.
- Importance in Timor-Leste: Limited water infrastructure, seasonal rainfall patterns

### Components of a Rainwater Harvesting System
1. Catchment area (usually a roof)
2. Gutters and downpipes
3. First flush diverter
4. Storage tank
5. Delivery system (pump or gravity-fed)

### Designing a System
- Calculate potential harvest: Roof area (mÂ²) x Annual rainfall (mm) x 0.8 (efficiency factor)
- Consider storage capacity needs based on dry season duration
- Material selection: Local availability, durability, cost

### Maintenance
- Regular cleaning of gutters and catchment area
- Inspection of tanks for cracks or leaks
- Water quality testing

## Natural Water Purification

### Bio-sand Filtration
- Layers: Gravel, coarse sand, fine sand, biological layer
- Function: Removes pathogens, turbidity, and some chemical contaminants
- Effectiveness: Can remove up to 99% of pathogens when properly maintained

### Other Natural Purification Methods
1. Solar disinfection (SODIS)
   - Process: Fill clear bottles with water and expose to sunlight for 6+ hours
   - Effectiveness: Kills most bacteria and viruses
2. Ceramic filters
   - Function: Porous ceramic removes particles and some pathogens
   - Advantages: Long-lasting, locally producible

### Water Quality Testing
- Basic tests: Turbidity, pH, coliform bacteria
- Importance of regular testing for safety

## Water Conservation Strategies

### Household Techniques
1. Fix leaks promptly
2. Install water-efficient fixtures
3. Collect and reuse greywater for gardens
4. Use mulch in gardens to reduce evaporation

### Agricultural Water Conservation
1. Drip irrigation systems
2. Mulching and composting to improve soil water retention
3. Crop selection based on water requirements
4. Rainwater harvesting for irrigation

### Greywater Recycling
- Definition: Reuse of wastewater from sinks, showers, and laundry
- Applications: Garden irrigation, toilet flushing
- Considerations: Use biodegradable soaps, avoid water containing fecal matter

# Discussion Questions

1. How might rainwater harvesting systems be adapted to fit different types of buildings common in Timor-Leste?
2. What cultural or social barriers might exist to implementing water conservation strategies in local communities? How can these be addressed?
3. How can traditional Timorese water management practices be integrated with modern techniques for better sustainability?
4. What are the potential health risks associated with improper water purification, and how can these risks be mitigated through education?
5. How might climate change impact water availability in Timor-Leste, and how can communities prepare for these changes?
6. What role can government policies play in promoting water conservation and sustainable water management practices?
7. How can schools and community centers serve as demonstration sites for water management techniques?
8. What are the economic benefits of implementing rainwater harvesting and water conservation strategies for households and communities?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Water Conservation Plan

1. Choose a typical household or small farm in Timor-Leste as your subject.
2. Assess the current water usage patterns and identify areas of potential waste or inefficiency.
3. Develop a comprehensive water conservation plan that includes:
   - At least five specific water-saving techniques or technologies
   - Estimated water savings for each technique
   - Implementation timeline
   - Potential challenges and solutions
   - Cost estimates for any necessary equipment or modifications
4. Write a 2-3 page report detailing your plan, including a brief introduction explaining the importance of water conservation in the local context.
5. Conclude with a paragraph on how this plan could be scaled up to community level.

# Assignment Details

## Rainwater Harvesting System Design

1. Select a local building (e.g., school, community center, or typical home) as your project site.
2. Gather the following information:
   - Roof dimensions and material
   - Local annual rainfall data
   - Estimated water needs for the building
3. Design a complete rainwater harvesting system including:
   - Catchment area calculations
   - Gutter and downpipe specifications
   - First flush diverter design
   - Storage tank size and material
   - Filtration method (if any)
   - Distribution system (pump or gravity-fed)
4. Create a detailed diagram of your system, labeling all components.
5. Write a 1-2 page report explaining your design choices, estimated costs, and potential water savings.
6. Include a maintenance schedule for the system.

## Bio-sand Filter Construction Guide

1. Materials needed:
   - Large plastic container or concrete mold
   - PVC pipe for outlet
   - Gravel (3-6mm diameter)
   - Coarse sand (0.7-1mm diameter)
   - Fine sand (0.15-0.3mm diameter)
   - Diffuser plate (can be made from a plastic container lid with holes)

2. Assembly steps:
   a. Prepare the container with an outlet pipe near the bottom
   b. Add a 5cm layer of gravel around the outlet pipe
   c. Add a 5cm layer of coarse sand
   d. Add a 50cm layer of fine sand
   e. Place the diffuser plate on top
   f. Fill with water and let it sit for 2-3 weeks to develop the biological layer

3. Maintenance:
   - Clean the diffuser plate weekly
   - Replace the top few centimeters of sand every few months or when flow rate decreases significantly
