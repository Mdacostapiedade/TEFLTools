# Support Material for Water Management and Conservation Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Rainwater harvesting**: The collection and storage of rainwater for reuse
- **Catchment area**: The surface area from which rainwater is collected, typically a roof
- **First flush diverter**: A device that diverts the initial, often contaminated, rainwater away from the storage tank
- **Bio-sand filter**: A point-of-use water treatment system using layers of sand and gravel to remove contaminants
- **Greywater**: Wastewater from household uses like laundry or dishwashing, excluding toilet waste
- **Water conservation**: The practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage
- **Filtration**: The process of passing water through a filter to remove impurities
- **Potable water**: Water that is safe to drink
- **Watershed**: An area of land that drains water into a specific body of water
- **Aquifer**: An underground layer of water-bearing rock

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Rainwater Harvesting System Diagram**
   - Description: A simple illustration showing a house with a sloped roof, gutters, downpipes, a first flush diverter, and a storage tank. Arrows indicate the flow of water from the roof to the tank.

2. **Bio-sand Filter Cross-section**
   - Description: A vertical cross-section of a bio-sand filter showing layers of gravel, coarse sand, fine sand, and the biological layer at the top. Arrows indicate water flow through the layers.

3. **Water Conservation Infographic**
   - Description: A visual representation of water-saving techniques, including low-flow showerheads, dual-flush toilets, drip irrigation, and mulching. Each technique is illustrated with a small icon and a brief description.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Rainwater Harvesting Calculation Worksheet**
   - Content: Provides a step-by-step guide for calculating potential rainwater harvest. Includes formulas, space for calculations, and a table of local rainfall data.

2. **Water Conservation Checklist**
   - Content: A list of water-saving practices for households, with checkboxes for students to mark which they already implement and which they plan to adopt.

3. **Bio-sand Filter Assembly Guide**
   - Content: A one-page illustrated guide showing the layers of a bio-sand filter and instructions for assembly.

4. Local NGO resources on water management (teacher to research and provide specific links)

5. Government of Timor-Leste water management policies and guidelines (teacher to source current documents)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language barriers**: 
   - Tip: Use visual aids extensively and encourage peer translation among students.

2. **Lack of prior knowledge about water systems**: 
   - Tip: Start with basic concepts and build gradually. Use local examples to make content relatable.

3. **Limited access to materials for hands-on activities**: 
   - Tip: Adapt activities using locally available materials. Encourage creative problem-solving.

4. **Cultural sensitivity around water use practices**: 
   - Tip: Research and respect local customs. Invite community elders to share traditional water management wisdom.

5. **Varying literacy levels**: 
   - Tip: Use a mix of verbal, visual, and hands-on teaching methods to cater to different learning styles.

6. **Misconceptions about water safety**: 
   - Tip: Address common local myths about water quality and provide clear, scientific explanations.

7. **Difficulty in visualizing long-term benefits**: 
   - Tip: Use case studies of successful water management projects in similar communities to demonstrate impact.

8. **Limited time for hands-on activities**: 
   - Tip: Prepare materials in advance and consider extending activities over multiple sessions if possible.
