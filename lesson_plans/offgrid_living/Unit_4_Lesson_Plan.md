# Lesson Plan: Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts on permaculture principles
- Seeds of local crop varieties
- Composting materials (green and brown matter, container)
- Natural pest control ingredients (neem oil, garlic, chili peppers)
- Graph paper and colored pencils for permaculture design
- Samples of local crops and traditional farming tools

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the basic principles of permaculture and how they apply to Timor-Leste
- Identify at least 5 traditional Timorese farming practices
- Design a simple permaculture plot suitable for the local climate
- Demonstrate basic composting techniques
- Describe 3 natural pest control methods using local ingredients

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display various local crops and traditional farming tools
- Ask students to identify each item and briefly explain its use or importance in Timorese agriculture
- Discuss how these crops and tools reflect traditional farming practices

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Permaculture
- Agroforestry
- Crop diversity
- Soil fertility
- Companion planting
- Seed saving
- Integrated pest management

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

a) Traditional Timorese Farming Practices (10 minutes)
- Discuss slash-and-burn agriculture and its environmental impact
- Explain traditional crop rotation and intercropping methods
- Highlight the importance of sacred groves and their role in conservation

b) Introduction to Permaculture (10 minutes)
- Define permaculture and its core principles
- Explain how permaculture can address challenges in Timorese agriculture
- Show examples of successful permaculture designs in tropical climates

c) Improving Soil Fertility and Crop Diversity (10 minutes)
- Discuss the importance of soil health in sustainable agriculture
- Explain composting and natural fertilization techniques
- Introduce the concept of polyculture and its benefits for pest control and yield

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

a) Permaculture Design Exercise (20 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with graph paper and colored pencils
- Ask groups to design a small permaculture plot (10m x 10m) suitable for a Timorese family, incorporating local crops and permaculture principles

b) Composting Demonstration (10 minutes)
- Show students how to layer green and brown materials for composting
- Explain the composting process and how to maintain a healthy compost pile

c) Natural Pest Control Preparation (10 minutes)
- Demonstrate how to prepare a simple natural pesticide using neem oil, garlic, and chili peppers
- Explain when and how to apply natural pest control solutions

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

a) Permaculture Design Presentations (15 minutes)
- Have each group briefly present their permaculture design to the class
- Encourage peer feedback and discussion on the designs

b) Hands-on Composting (15 minutes)
- Have students create their own small compost containers using local materials
- Guide them through the process of layering materials correctly

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Ask students to share one new thing they learned and how they might apply it
- Address any remaining questions or concerns

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and document 3 traditional Timorese farming practices not covered in class
- Create a seed-saving plan for 5 local crop varieties, including storage methods and planting schedules
- Design a permaculture garden for their home or community space, incorporating at least 3 permaculture principles

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Permaculture: A system of agricultural and social design principles centered on simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and features observed in natural ecosystems.
- Agroforestry: A land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland.
- Crop diversity: The variety of plant species used for agriculture within a given area or farming system.
- Soil fertility: The ability of soil to sustain plant growth by providing essential plant nutrients and favorable chemical, physical, and biological characteristics.
- Companion planting: The close planting of different plants that enhance each other's growth or protect each other from pests.
- Seed saving: The practice of saving seeds from vegetables, grains, herbs, and flowers for use from year to year.
- Integrated pest management: An ecosystem-based approach to crop protection that combines different management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and minimize the use of pesticides.
