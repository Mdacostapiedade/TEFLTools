## Traditional Timorese Farming Practices

### Slash-and-Burn Agriculture
- Definition: Clearing land by cutting and burning vegetation
- Process:
  1. Clear forest area
  2. Burn cleared vegetation
  3. Plant crops in ash-enriched soil
  4. Cultivate for 2-3 years
  5. Abandon land to regrow forest
- Environmental impacts:
  - Soil erosion
  - Loss of biodiversity
  - Contribution to climate change
- Cultural significance in Timor-Leste

### Traditional Crop Rotation and Intercropping
- Crop rotation:
  - Definition: Planting different crops sequentially in the same field
  - Benefits:
    - Improved soil health
    - Pest and disease management
    - Increased yield
- Intercropping:
  - Definition: Growing two or more crops in proximity
  - Common combinations in Timor-Leste:
    - Corn and beans
    - Cassava and sweet potatoes
  - Benefits:
    - Efficient land use
    - Natural pest control
    - Improved soil fertility

### Sacred Groves
- Definition: Forest areas protected for spiritual or cultural reasons
- Importance in Timorese culture:
  - Spiritual significance
  - Traditional ecological knowledge preservation
- Conservation role:
  - Biodiversity hotspots
  - Seed banks for native species
  - Water source protection

## Introduction to Permaculture

### Core Principles
1. Observe and interact
2. Catch and store energy
3. Obtain a yield
4. Apply self-regulation and accept feedback
5. Use and value renewable resources and services
6. Produce no waste
7. Design from patterns to details
8. Integrate rather than segregate
9. Use small and slow solutions
10. Use and value diversity
11. Use edges and value the marginal
12. Creatively use and respond to change

### Application to Timorese Agriculture
- Water management:
  - Swales and contour planting for erosion control
  - Rainwater harvesting systems
- Soil improvement:
  - Mulching with local materials
  - Composting techniques adapted to tropical climate
- Integrated animal systems:
  - Chickens for pest control and fertilization
  - Fish in rice paddies (aquaculture)
- Forest gardens:
  - Multi-layered cultivation mimicking natural forest structure
  - Integration of native fruit and nut trees

### Examples of Successful Tropical Permaculture Designs
- IDEP Foundation's demonstration site in Bali, Indonesia
- Zaytuna Farm in New South Wales, Australia (tropical/subtropical)
- Permaculture Research Institute of Kenya's demonstration farm

## Improving Soil Fertility and Crop Diversity

### Soil Health Importance
- Nutrient cycling
- Water retention

- Microbial activity support

### Composting and Natural Fertilization
- Composting methods:
  - Hot composting
  - Vermicomposting
  - Bokashi composting
- Local materials for fertilization:
  - Seaweed
  - Fish waste
  - Coffee grounds
  - Banana peels

### Polyculture Benefits
- Definition: Growing multiple crop species in the same space
- Advantages:
  - Natural pest control
  - Improved pollination
  - Efficient resource use
  - Increased overall yield
- Examples of polyculture combinations for Timor-Leste:
  1. Corn, beans, and squash (Three Sisters method)
  2. Coffee, shade trees, and root crops
  3. Rice, azolla, and fish

4. Discuss the role of crop diversity in enhancing food security and resilience to climate change in Timor-Leste.

5. How can permaculture design principles be adapted to address specific environmental challenges in Timor-Leste, such as soil erosion or water scarcity?

6. What are some culturally appropriate ways to introduce new agricultural techniques to traditional farming communities in Timor-Leste?

7. How might improving soil fertility through natural methods impact the overall ecosystem and biodiversity in agricultural areas?

8. Discuss the potential economic benefits of implementing permaculture systems for small-scale farmers in Timor-Leste.

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Permaculture Design Reflection

1. Based on the permaculture design you created during the class activity, write a 500-word reflection addressing the following points:

   a. Describe your design and explain how it incorporates at least three permaculture principles.
   
   b. Discuss how your design is specifically tailored to the climate and environmental conditions of Timor-Leste.
   
   c. Explain how your design addresses potential challenges such as water scarcity, soil erosion, or pest management.
   
   d. Reflect on how implementing this design could benefit a Timorese family in terms of food security and sustainability.
   
   e. Identify any areas where you think your design could be improved or expanded upon.

2. Format your reflection with clear paragraphs and use specific examples from your design to illustrate your points.

3. Conclude your reflection by discussing how this exercise has changed or reinforced your understanding of sustainable agriculture in Timor-Leste.
