Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security in Timor-Leste, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security in Timor-Leste

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Permaculture**: A system of agricultural and social design principles centered on simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and features observed in natural ecosystems.
- **Agroforestry**: A land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland.
- **Crop diversity**: The variety of plant species used for agriculture within a given area or farming system.
- **Soil fertility**: The ability of soil to sustain plant growth by providing essential plant nutrients and favorable chemical, physical, and biological characteristics.
- **Companion planting**: The close planting of different plants that enhance each other's growth or protect each other from pests.
- **Seed saving**: The practice of saving seeds from vegetables, grains, herbs, and flowers for use from year to year.
- **Integrated pest management**: An ecosystem-based approach to crop protection that combines different management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and minimize the use of pesticides.
- **Polyculture**: The practice of growing multiple crop species in the same space, mimicking the diversity of natural ecosystems.
- **Sacred groves**: Areas of forest protected by local communities for religious or cultural reasons, often serving as biodiversity hotspots.
- **Slash-and-burn agriculture**: A farming method where forest land is cleared by cutting and burning vegetation before cultivation.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Permaculture Zones Diagram**: A circular diagram showing the five permaculture zones, from Zone 0 (home) to Zone 5 (wilderness), with examples of elements in each zone relevant to Timor-Leste.

2. **Companion Planting Chart**: A visual guide showing compatible plant combinations common in Timor-Leste, such as corn, beans, and squash (Three Sisters planting).

3. **Composting Layers Illustration**: A cross-section diagram of a compost pile, showing the proper layering of green and brown materials, with labels for each layer.

4. **Traditional Timorese Farming Tools**: Sketches or photographs of local farming tools with labels and brief descriptions of their uses.

5. **Natural Pest Control Ingredients**: Images of neem leaves, garlic, and chili peppers, with arrows pointing to a spray bottle to illustrate the creation of natural pesticides.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Permaculture Design Worksheet**: A template for students to create their 10m x 10m permaculture plot design, including a grid, legend, and checklist of permaculture principles to incorporate.

2. **Traditional Farming Practices Questionnaire**: A worksheet with questions about traditional Timorese farming methods, encouraging students to interview elders or research local practices.

3. **Crop Diversity Checklist**: A list of common Timorese crops with spaces for students to add information about planting seasons, companion plants, and uses.

4. **Composting Recipe Card**: A fill-in-the-blank worksheet where students can create their own composting recipe using locally available materials.

5. **Seed Saving Log**: A template for students to record information about seeds they're saving, including plant name, harvest date, storage method, and planting schedule.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability" by David Holmgren
2. "Tropical Permaculture Guidebook" by Permatil Timor-Leste
3. "The New Organic Grower" by Eliot Coleman
4. Online course: "Introduction to Permaculture" by Oregon State University (free on edX)
5. Website: Seeds of Diversity (www.seeds.ca) for information on seed saving techniques
6. Local resource: Timor-Leste Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries website for regional crop information and agricultural programs

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language barriers**: Prepare key terms in both English and Tetum. Consider using visual aids and hands-on demonstrations to overcome language challenges.

2. **Limited resources**: Adapt activities to use locally available materials. Encourage students to be creative with substitutions for composting and natural pest control ingredients.

3. **Cultural sensitivity**: Be aware of local customs and taboos related to agriculture. Invite a local elder or experienced farmer to share traditional knowledge and validate its importance.

4. **Varying levels of agricultural experience**: Pair students with different backgrounds for group activities to encourage peer learning and knowledge sharing.

5. **Climate variability**: Discuss how climate change might affect local agriculture and brainstorm adaptive strategies within the permaculture framework.

6. **Resistance to new methods**: Frame permaculture principles as enhancements to traditional practices rather than replacements. Highlight successful local examples of sustainable agriculture.

7. **Limited technology**: Prepare alternative methods for presenting information if projectors or computers are unavailable, such as large hand-drawn posters or printed handouts.

8. **Time constraints**: Prioritize hands-on activities if time is limited. Consider extending the lesson into a series or incorporating elements into a longer-term class project.
