# Lesson Plan: Sustainable Building Techniques in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Slideshow with images of traditional Timorese architecture and modern sustainable buildings
- Samples of local building materials (bamboo, earth, reclaimed materials)
- Basic tools for hands-on workshop (saws, hammers, nails, rope)
- Handouts on passive solar design principles
- Safety equipment (gloves, goggles) for workshop

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify key features of traditional Timorese architecture that contribute to sustainability
- Explain the benefits and applications of using bamboo, earth, and reclaimed materials in construction
- Describe basic principles of passive solar design for tropical climates
- Construct a simple structure using local sustainable materials

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show images of various buildings (both traditional and modern) from around Timor-Leste
- Ask students to identify which buildings they think are most sustainable and why
- Discuss responses as a class, highlighting key sustainability features

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Thermal mass
- Natural ventilation
- Adobe
- Bamboo joinery
- Passive cooling
- Reclaimed materials

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Traditional Timorese Architecture
- Overview of common house styles (e.g., uma lulik, uma lisan)
- Sustainable features: raised floors, thatched roofs, natural ventilation

### Natural Building Materials
- Bamboo: strength, versatility, rapid growth
- Earth: adobe, rammed earth, cob techniques
- Reclaimed materials: reducing waste, creative reuse

### Passive Solar Design for Tropical Climates
- Orientation and shading
- Natural ventilation strategies
- Thermal mass for cooling

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- In small groups, students analyze photos of local buildings, identifying sustainable features and suggesting improvements
- Students sketch a simple house design incorporating learned principles

## 7. Production Task: Hands-on Workshop (60 minutes)

- Divide class into teams
- Each team constructs a small shelter (e.g., 1m x 1m) using provided local materials
- Emphasize incorporation of learned techniques and principles

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Teams present their structures, explaining design choices
- Class discussion on challenges faced and solutions found
- Quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research one traditional building technique from another tropical country
- Write a short report (1-2 pages) comparing it to Timorese methods and discussing its potential application in Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Thermal mass: Materials that absorb and store heat energy
- Natural ventilation: The process of supplying and removing air through a building without mechanical systems
- Adobe: A building material made from earth and organic materials
- Bamboo joinery: Techniques for connecting bamboo pieces in construction
- Passive cooling: Architectural features that help cool a building without mechanical assistance
- Reclaimed materials: Previously used materials repurposed for new construction
