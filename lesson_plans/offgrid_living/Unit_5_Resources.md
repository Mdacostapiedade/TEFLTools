# Lecture Notes

## Traditional Timorese Architecture

### Uma Lulik (Sacred House)
- Central to Timorese culture and spirituality
- Typically built on stilts with a steep thatched roof
- Materials: wood frame, bamboo walls, palm leaf or grass thatch
- Sustainable features:
  * Raised floor for ventilation and protection from moisture/pests
  * Thick thatch provides excellent insulation
  * Natural materials are locally sourced and biodegradable

### Uma Lisan (Clan House)
- Larger communal structure for extended families
- Similar construction to Uma Lulik but often more elaborate
- Sustainable features:
  * Open design allows for natural air circulation
  * Large overhanging roof provides shade and rain protection
  * Modular design allows for easy repairs and expansions

### Common Sustainable Elements in Traditional Architecture
1. Use of local, renewable materials
2. Adaptation to local climate (e.g., raised floors in flood-prone areas)
3. Natural ventilation through strategic openings and roof design
4. Minimal environmental impact during construction and lifecycle

## Natural Building Materials

### Bamboo
- Advantages:
  * Fast-growing and renewable (full maturity in 3-5 years)
  * High strength-to-weight ratio
  * Flexible and earthquake-resistant
  * Naturally pest-resistant (with proper treatment)
- Applications:
  * Structural framing
  * Walls and partitions
  * Flooring
  * Roofing (bamboo shingles)
- Sustainable harvesting practices:
  * Cut mature culms (4-5 years old)
  * Harvest during dry season to reduce starch content
  * Leave at least 1/3 of the culms in each clump

### Earth Building Techniques
1. Adobe
   - Sun-dried earth bricks
   - Mix: clay, sand, straw or other fibers
   - Benefits: excellent thermal mass, low cost, easy to make
2. Rammed Earth
   - Compacted earth walls built in forms
   - Mix: proper ratio of clay, sand, and aggregate
   - Benefits: durability, fire-resistant, good insulation
3. Cob
   - Hand-sculpted earth walls
   - Mix: clay-rich soil, sand, straw
   - Benefits: artistic freedom, no forms needed, good thermal mass

### Reclaimed Materials
- Sources in Timor-Leste:
  * Deconstructed buildings
  * Shipping containers
  * Discarded plastic bottles
  * Old tires
- Benefits:
  * Reduces waste and environmental impact
  * Often cost-effective
  * Unique aesthetic appeal
- Considerations:
  * Ensure materials are free from hazardous substances
  * May require additional treatment or preparation

## Passive Solar Design for Tropical Climates

### Orientation and Shading
- Orient buildings to minimize sun exposure on long sides
- Use deep overhangs or verandas for shade
- Incorporate adjustable shading devices (e.g., bamboo screens)

### Natural Ventilation Strategies
- Cross-ventilation: align openings on opposite walls
- Stack effect: use high ceilings and roof vents to create air movement
- Courtyard designs to promote air circulation

### Thermal Mass for Cooling
- Use dense materials (e.g., rammed earth, adobe) to absorb heat during day
- Night flushing: open buildings at night to release stored heat
- Combine with proper insulation to prevent heat gain

# Discussion Questions

1. How do traditional Timorese building techniques address local climate challenges? Can these methods be improved with modern knowledge?

2. What are the potential challenges and benefits of incorporating more bamboo into modern construction in Timor-Leste?

3. How might earth building techniques be adapted to withstand Timor-Leste's occasional earthquakes and heavy rains?

4. Discuss the cultural significance of traditional Timorese architecture. How can we balance preserving cultural heritage with adopting new sustainable building practices?

5. What are some creative ways to use reclaimed materials in construction that you've seen or can imagine for Timor-Leste?

6. How can passive solar design principles be effectively applied in both rural and urban settings in Timor-Leste?

7. What role should government policy play in promoting sustainable building techniques? What incentives or regulations might be effective?

8. How might climate change impact building design needs in Timor-Leste over the next few decades? How can we prepare for these changes?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Sustainable Building Design Proposal

1. Choose a specific location in Timor-Leste (e.g., coastal village, mountain town, urban neighborhood).

2. Write a 2-3 page proposal for a sustainable community building (e.g., school, health clinic, community center) that incorporates:
   - At least two traditional Timorese architectural elements
   - Use of local, sustainable building materials
   - Passive solar design principles for tropical climates
   - Consideration of potential natural disasters in the chosen location

3. Your proposal should include:
   - Brief description of the chosen location and its climate
   - Overview of the building's purpose and required spaces
   - Detailed explanation of sustainable design features
   - Justification for material choices
   - Simple sketch or diagram of the proposed design

4. Conclude with a paragraph on how this building could serve as a model for future sustainable construction in Timor-Leste.

# Assignment Details

## Field Trip Report and Analysis

1. During the field trip, take detailed notes and photographs of at least three buildings: one traditional structure, one modern sustainable building, and one conventional modern building.

2. For each building, record:
   - Approximate age and purpose
   - Main construction materials
   - Notable architectural features
   - Observed sustainable design elements (or lack thereof)
   - Occupant or guide comments on building performance

3. Write a 4-5 page report that includes:
   - Brief descriptions of each building
   - Comparative analysis of sustainability features
   - Assessment of how well each building suits Timor-Leste's climate and culture
   - Recommendations for improving the sustainability of the conventional modern building
   - Reflection on lessons learned and how they can be applied to future construction projects

4. Include annotated photographs or sketches to illustrate key points.

5. Conclude with your perspective on the future of sustainable building in Timor-Leste, incorporating insights from the field trip and course materials.

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Bamboo School in Bali, Indonesia

The Green School in Bali serves as an excellent example of large-scale bamboo construction in a tropical climate. Key features include:

- All-bamboo structures, including a 60-meter bridge
- Open-air classrooms with natural ventilation
- Curved organic forms that maximize strength and aesthetics
- Solar panels and micro-hydro power generation
- Permaculture gardens integrated with the campus

Students should research this project and consider how similar principles could be applied in Timor-Leste.

## Local Material Samples

Provide students with samples of:
- Different bamboo species common in Timor-Leste
- Local earth suitable for adobe or rammed earth construction
- Traditional thatching materials
- Examples of reclaimed materials with building potential

Allow students to handle and examine these materials to better understand their properties and potential applications.

## Passive Solar Design Simulation

Use free online tools like Sefaira or Climate Consultant to demonstrate how passive solar design principles affect building performance in Timor-Leste's climate. Show simulations of:

- Different building orientations
- Various window placements and sizes
- Effects of thermal mass and insulation
- Impact of shading devices

This visual demonstration will help students grasp the practical implications of design choices.
