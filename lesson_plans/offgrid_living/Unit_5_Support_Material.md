# Support Material for Sustainable Building Techniques in Timor-Leste

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Thermal mass**: Materials that absorb and store heat energy, helping to regulate indoor temperatures.
- **Natural ventilation**: The process of supplying and removing air through a building without mechanical systems.
- **Adobe**: A building material made from earth and organic materials, often formed into bricks and dried in the sun.
- **Bamboo joinery**: Techniques for connecting bamboo pieces in construction, often using natural fibers or wooden pegs.
- **Passive cooling**: Architectural features that help cool a building without mechanical assistance, such as shading or cross-ventilation.
- **Reclaimed materials**: Previously used materials repurposed for new construction, reducing waste and resource consumption.
- **Uma lulik**: Traditional sacred house in Timorese culture, often featuring sustainable building techniques.
- **Uma lisan**: Customary house in Timor-Leste, typically built using local materials and traditional methods.
- **Rammed earth**: A technique for building walls using compacted natural raw materials such as earth, chalk, lime, or gravel.
- **Cob**: A natural building material made from subsoil, water, fibrous organic material (typically straw), and sometimes lime.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Limited access to materials**: 
   - Partner with local builders or suppliers to source small quantities of materials for demonstrations
   - Encourage students to bring samples of natural materials from their own environments

2. **Varying levels of prior knowledge**:
   - Begin with a quick assessment to gauge students' familiarity with building concepts
   - Use peer teaching to pair more experienced students with those who need additional support

3. **Safety concerns during hands-on activities**:
   - Provide clear safety guidelines and demonstrate proper use of tools before starting
   - Ensure adequate supervision and have a first aid kit readily available

4. **Bridging traditional and modern techniques**:
   - Invite local elders or traditional builders to share their knowledge as guest speakers
   - Emphasize the value of combining time-tested methods with innovative approaches

5. **Adapting to local climate conditions**:
   - If possible, conduct outdoor activities during cooler parts of the day
   - Have alternative indoor activities prepared in case of inclement weather

6. **Language barriers**:
   - Prepare key terms and instructions in both English and Tetum
   - Use visual demonstrations alongside verbal explanations to enhance understanding
