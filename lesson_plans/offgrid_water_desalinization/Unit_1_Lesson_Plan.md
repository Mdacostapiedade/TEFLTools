# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Desalination and Water Challenges in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with case study information
- Map of Timor-Leste showing water resources
- Video clips of desalination processes
- Internet access for research

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the basic principles of desalination
- Identify major water scarcity issues in Timor-Leste
- Analyze the cultural significance of water in Timorese communities
- Evaluate potential solutions for local water challenges

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show images of water scarcity and abundance in Timor-Leste
- Ask students to share personal experiences or observations related to water access in their communities

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Desalination
- Reverse osmosis
- Brackish water
- Water scarcity
- Aquifer
- Salinity

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Overview of Desalination Processes
- Definition and purpose of desalination
- Brief explanation of main desalination methods (reverse osmosis, thermal processes)
- Video demonstration of reverse osmosis process

### Water Resources and Challenges in Timor-Leste
- Present map of Timor-Leste's water resources
- Discuss main water sources: rivers, groundwater, rainwater
- Explain key challenges: seasonal variability, infrastructure limitations, water quality issues

### Cultural Significance of Water in Timorese Communities
- Traditional water management practices
- Spiritual and social importance of water sources
- Impact of water scarcity on daily life and community relations

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Group Discussion on Local Water Challenges
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group identifies and discusses water challenges in their local area
- Groups present their findings to the class

### Case Study Analysis
- Provide handouts with information about a coastal village's water needs
- Students work in pairs to analyze the case and propose potential solutions

## 7. Production Tasks (20 minutes)

### Mind Mapping
- Students create individual mind maps connecting desalination concepts, water challenges, and cultural aspects discussed in the lesson

### Role Play
- Students act out a community meeting discussing the introduction of a desalination project, considering various stakeholder perspectives

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Brief discussion on how desalination might address some of Timor-Leste's water challenges

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 500-word report on a specific water challenge in a Timorese community of their choice
- Prepare three questions for a guest speaker (local water resource manager) who will visit in the next class

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Desalination: The process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater or brackish water to make it suitable for human consumption or irrigation
- Reverse osmosis: A water purification method that uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove ions, molecules, and larger particles from drinking water
- Brackish water: Water that has more salinity than fresh water, but not as much as seawater
- Water scarcity: The lack of sufficient available water resources to meet water needs within a region
- Aquifer: An underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or unconsolidated materials
- Salinity: The amount of dissolved salts in water
