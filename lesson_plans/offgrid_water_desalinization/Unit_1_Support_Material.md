Here's the support material for the lesson plan, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Introduction to Desalination and Water Challenges in Timor-Leste

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Desalination: The process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater or brackish water to make it suitable for human consumption or irrigation
- Reverse osmosis: A water purification method that uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove ions, molecules, and larger particles from drinking water
- Brackish water: Water that has more salinity than fresh water, but not as much as seawater
- Water scarcity: The lack of sufficient available water resources to meet water needs within a region
- Aquifer: An underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or unconsolidated materials
- Salinity: The amount of dissolved salts in water
- Thermal desalination: A process that uses heat to separate salt from water through evaporation and condensation
- Brine: Highly concentrated salt water that is a byproduct of desalination processes
- Groundwater: Water held underground in soil or in pores and crevices in rock
- Watershed: An area of land that drains water, sediment, and dissolved materials to a common outlet

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Map of Timor-Leste Water Resources:
   - A color-coded map showing major rivers, aquifers, and coastal areas
   - Legend indicating freshwater sources, brackish water areas, and regions of water scarcity

2. Reverse Osmosis Process Diagram:
   - Simple schematic showing:
     a) Saltwater input
     b) High-pressure pump
     c) Semi-permeable membrane
     d) Freshwater output
     e) Brine discharge

3. Water Scarcity vs. Abundance Comparison:
   - Side-by-side images contrasting:
     a) A dry, cracked riverbed during the dry season
     b) A flowing river during the rainy season

4. Traditional Water Management Practices:
   - Illustrations of:
     a) A tua po (sacred water source)
     b) Community water sharing system

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Case Study Analysis Worksheet:
   - Background information on a coastal village in Timor-Leste
   - Current water sources and challenges
   - Questions for students to answer:
     a) What are the main water-related issues in this village?
     b) How might desalination address these issues?
     c) What cultural factors should be considered when implementing a desalination project?
     d) Propose a small-scale desalination solution for this village

2. Mind Mapping Template:
   - Central node: "Water in Timor-Leste"
   - Main branches:
     a) Desalination Technologies
     b) Water Challenges
     c) Cultural Significance
     d) Potential Solutions
   - Space for students to add sub-branches and connections

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Academic Articles:
   - "Water Resources Management in Timor-Leste: Institutional Challenges and Opportunities" by Nesbitt et al. (2016)
   - "Small-scale Desalination Systems for Rural Communities in Developing Countries" by Ghaffour et al. (2013)

2. Online Resources:
   - UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education: Free online course on Water and Sustainability
   - World Bank Data: Timor-Leste Water and Sanitation Statistics

3. Local Organizations:
   - Bee Timor-Leste (local water NGO): Reports and community engagement opportunities
   - Timor-Leste National Directorate for Water Resources: Policy documents and water management plans

4. Interactive Learning:
   - Water Footprint Calculator: Online tool for students to calculate their personal water usage
   - Desalination Plant Virtual Tour: 360-degree virtual tour of a reverse osmosis facility

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barriers:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle with technical terms in English
   - Solution: Provide a bilingual vocabulary list (English and Tetum) and encourage peer translation

2. Limited Prior Knowledge:
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of understanding about water systems
   - Solution: Start with a basic assessment and adjust the lesson pace accordingly; use local examples to build on existing knowledge

3. Cultural Sensitivity:
   - Challenge: Discussing traditional practices may be sensitive for some students
   - Solution: Invite a local elder or community leader to share insights; emphasize respect for traditional knowledge

4. Limited Resources:
   - Challenge: Lack of access to technology or materials for demonstrations
   - Solution: Prepare low-tech alternatives (e.g., hand-drawn diagrams, role-play activities) and encourage group sharing of available resources

5. Connecting Global Concepts to Local Context:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle to see the relevance of desalination to their communities
   - Solution: Use plenty of local examples and case studies; encourage students to share personal experiences with water challenges

6. Engaging Different Learning Styles:
   - Challenge: Diverse student learning preferences
   - Solution: Incorporate a mix of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic activities; allow for both individual and group work options
