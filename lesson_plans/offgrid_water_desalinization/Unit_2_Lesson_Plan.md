# Lesson Plan: Desalination Technologies

## 1. Resources Needed

- Textbook: "Introduction to Desalination: Systems, Processes and Environmental Impacts" by Alireza Bazargan
- Computer lab with internet access for virtual lab simulation
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on different desalination technologies
- Video projector for presentations

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Compare and contrast different desalination methods
- Evaluate the suitability of various desalination technologies for Timor-Leste's context
- Explain the basic principles of reverse osmosis
- Identify key components of thermal desalination processes
- Discuss emerging desalination technologies

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students match desalination terms with their definitions
- Group discussion: What do you already know about desalination methods?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Reverse osmosis
- Thermal desalination
- Membrane
- Brine
- Distillation
- Osmotic pressure

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Reverse Osmosis (RO)
- Principles of RO
- Components of an RO system
- Advantages and limitations

### Thermal Desalination Processes
- Multi-stage flash distillation (MSF)
- Multiple-effect distillation (MED)
- Vapor compression distillation (VCD)

### Emerging Technologies
- Forward osmosis
- Membrane distillation
- Capacitive deionization

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Small group work: Create a comparison chart of desalination technologies
- Pair discussion: Evaluate which technologies might be most suitable for Timor-Leste and why

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

- Virtual lab: RO process simulation using online software
- Students analyze simulation results and present findings to the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion: Key takeaways from the lesson
- Quick recap of main points covered

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 2-page report on one emerging desalination technology and its potential application in Timor-Leste
- Prepare questions for next class's guest speaker from a local water treatment facility

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Reverse osmosis: A water purification process that uses a partially permeable membrane to separate ions, unwanted molecules, and larger particles from drinking water
- Thermal desalination: A process of desalination that involves heating seawater and collecting the condensed vapor to produce fresh water
- Membrane: A selective barrier that allows some things to pass through but not others
- Brine: Highly concentrated salt solution that is a byproduct of desalination
- Distillation: The process of purifying a liquid by successive evaporation and condensation
- Osmotic pressure: The minimum pressure needed to prevent the inward flow of water across a semipermeable membrane
