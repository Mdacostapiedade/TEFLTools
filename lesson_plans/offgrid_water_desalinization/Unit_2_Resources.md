## Reverse Osmosis (RO)

### Principles of RO
- Osmosis: Natural movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from low to high solute concentration
- Reverse osmosis: Application of pressure to reverse natural osmotic flow
- Semipermeable membrane allows water molecules to pass but blocks larger molecules and ions

### Components of an RO System
1. Pretreatment system
   - Removes larger particles and adjusts water chemistry
2. High-pressure pump
   - Provides necessary pressure to overcome osmotic pressure
3. Semipermeable membrane
   - Typically made of thin-film composite materials
4. Post-treatment system
   - Adjusts pH and remineralizes water if needed

### Advantages and Limitations
Advantages:
- High salt rejection rate (95-99%)
- Effective for various contaminants
- Modular and scalable

Limitations:
- High energy consumption
- Membrane fouling and replacement costs
- Brine disposal challenges

## Thermal Desalination Processes

### Multi-Stage Flash Distillation (MSF)
- Process: Rapid heating of seawater and sequential flashing in multiple stages
- Characteristics:
  * High energy consumption
  * Large-scale production capacity
  * Robust and reliable technology

### Multiple-Effect Distillation (MED)
- Process: Successive evaporation and condensation in multiple effects
- Characteristics:
  * More energy-efficient than MSF
  * Lower operating temperatures
  * Suitable for cogeneration plants

### Vapor Compression Distillation (VCD)
- Process: Mechanical compression of vapor to provide heat for evaporation
- Characteristics:
  * Suitable for small to medium-scale operations
  * Lower energy consumption than MSF and MED
  * Compact design

## Emerging Technologies

### Forward Osmosis
- Principle: Uses osmotic pressure differential instead of hydraulic pressure
- Advantages:
  * Lower energy consumption
  * Reduced membrane fouling
- Challenges:
  * Draw solution recovery
  * Membrane development

### Membrane Distillation
- Principle: Combines thermal and membrane processes
- Advantages:
  * Can use low-grade heat sources
  * High rejection of non-volatile contaminants
- Challenges:
  * Membrane wetting
  * Heat efficiency

### Capacitive Deionization
- Principle: Electrosorption of ions onto charged electrodes
- Advantages:
  * Energy-efficient for brackish water
  * No high-pressure components
- Challenges:
  * Limited effectiveness for high salinity water
  * Electrode material development
