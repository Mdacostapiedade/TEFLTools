# Support Materials for Desalination Technologies Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Reverse osmosis (RO): A water purification process that uses a partially permeable membrane to remove ions, molecules, and larger particles from drinking water.
- Thermal desalination: A process of desalination that involves heating seawater and collecting the condensed vapor to produce fresh water.
- Membrane: A selective barrier that allows some things to pass through but not others.
- Brine: Highly concentrated salt solution that is a byproduct of desalination.
- Distillation: The process of purifying a liquid by successive evaporation and condensation.
- Osmotic pressure: The minimum pressure needed to prevent the inward flow of water across a semipermeable membrane.
- Multi-stage flash distillation (MSF): A water desalination process that distills seawater by flashing a portion of the water into steam in multiple stages of heat exchangers.
- Multiple-effect distillation (MED): A distillation process that uses multiple stages where water is boiled and condensed to produce fresh water.
- Vapor compression distillation (VCD): A distillation method that uses a heat pump to compress water vapor to produce fresh water.
- Forward osmosis: A process that uses a semi-permeable membrane and a draw solution to separate water from dissolved solids.
- Membrane distillation: A thermally driven separation process that uses a hydrophobic membrane to separate water vapor from a liquid solution.
- Capacitive deionization: An electrochemical method to remove salt ions from water using porous electrodes.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling to understand the concept of osmosis and reverse osmosis.
   Solution: Use a simple demonstration with a U-tube and semi-permeable membrane to visually explain osmosis, then relate it to the reverse process.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in grasping the scale and complexity of industrial desalination plants.
   Solution: Utilize virtual tours of desalination plants and scale models to help students visualize the processes.

3. Challenge: Students may have trouble relating desalination technologies to the specific context of Timor-Leste.
   Solution: Incorporate local case studies and invite guest speakers from local water management authorities to provide context.

4. Challenge: Keeping students engaged during technical explanations of different processes.
   Solution: Use interactive simulations and hands-on activities to break up lecture portions and allow students to explore concepts actively.

5. Challenge: Ensuring students understand the environmental impacts of desalination.
   Solution: Organize a debate on the pros and cons of desalination, encouraging students to research and present different perspectives.
