# Lesson Plan: Project Planning and Feasibility Studies for Desalination in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Printed maps of Timor-Leste coastal areas
- Handouts on site selection criteria and environmental impact assessment guidelines
- Access to computers with internet for research
- Role-play scenario cards for stakeholder consultation exercise

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify key factors in selecting sites for desalination projects in Timor-Leste
- Conduct a basic environmental impact assessment for a desalination project
- Perform a preliminary economic feasibility analysis for a small-scale desalination plant
- Engage in effective stakeholder consultation through role-play

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students match common challenges in Timor-Leste (e.g., limited infrastructure, seasonal water scarcity) with potential desalination solutions.
- Brief discussion on why project planning is crucial for successful desalination implementation.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Feasibility study
- Site selection criteria
- Environmental impact assessment (EIA)
- Stakeholder consultation
- Economic viability
- Capital expenditure (CAPEX)
- Operational expenditure (OPEX)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### a. Site Selection Criteria (15 minutes)
- Proximity to water source and demand centers
- Topography and land availability
- Energy access and infrastructure
- Environmental sensitivity
- Social and cultural considerations

### b. Environmental Impact Assessment (15 minutes)
- Purpose and scope of EIAs
- Key environmental factors to consider:
  * Marine ecosystem impacts
  * Brine disposal
  * Energy use and emissions
  * Noise and visual impacts
- EIA process overview

### c. Economic Feasibility Analysis (15 minutes)
- Components of a feasibility study
- Capital costs vs. operational costs
- Funding sources and financial models
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Considering local economic factors in Timor-Leste

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

### a. Site Selection Exercise (20 minutes)
- In small groups, students use maps of Timor-Leste to identify potential desalination plant locations.
- Groups present their choices, explaining their rationale based on the criteria discussed.

### b. Mini Environmental Impact Assessment (25 minutes)
- Students work in pairs to list potential environmental impacts for a hypothetical desalination project in Timor-Leste.
- They then propose mitigation measures for each impact identified.

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

### a. Group Project: Preliminary Feasibility Study (30 minutes)
- Divide the class into groups of 4-5 students.
- Each group is assigned a specific coastal location in Timor-Leste.
- Groups conduct a rapid feasibility study, considering:
  * Site suitability
  * Potential environmental impacts
  * Basic economic analysis
- Groups prepare a brief presentation of their findings.

### b. Role-play Exercise: Stakeholder Consultation (30 minutes)
- Assign roles to students (e.g., project developer, local fisherman, government official, environmental activist).
- Conduct a mock stakeholder consultation meeting for a proposed desalination project.
- Debrief on the challenges and importance of stakeholder engagement.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick recap of key points from the lesson
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Brief discussion on how the day's learning applies to real-world desalination projects in Timor-Leste

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Individual task: Write a 2-page report on the potential social and cultural impacts of introducing desalination technology to a traditional coastal community in Timor-Leste.
- Research task: Find and summarize one case study of a small-scale desalination project in a developing country context similar to Timor-Leste.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Feasibility study: An assessment of the practicality and viability of a proposed project.
- Site selection criteria: Factors considered when choosing the location for a desalination plant.
- Environmental impact assessment (EIA): A process of evaluating the likely environmental effects of a proposed project or development.
- Stakeholder consultation: The process of engaging with individuals or groups who may be affected by or have an interest in a project.
- Economic viability: The ability of a project to generate sufficient financial returns to justify its implementation and operation.
- Capital expenditure (CAPEX): The funds used to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property, buildings, or equipment.
- Operational expenditure (OPEX): The ongoing costs for running a project, business, or system.
