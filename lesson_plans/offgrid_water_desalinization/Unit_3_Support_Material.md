Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Project Planning and Feasibility Studies for Desalination in Timor-Leste, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Feasibility study**: An assessment of the practicality and viability of a proposed project.
- **Site selection criteria**: Factors considered when choosing the location for a desalination plant.
- **Environmental impact assessment (EIA)**: A process of evaluating the likely environmental effects of a proposed project or development.
- **Stakeholder consultation**: The process of engaging with individuals or groups who may be affected by or have an interest in a project.
- **Economic viability**: The ability of a project to generate sufficient financial returns to justify its implementation and operation.
- **Capital expenditure (CAPEX)**: The funds used to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property, buildings, or equipment.
- **Operational expenditure (OPEX)**: The ongoing costs for running a project, business, or system.
- **Brine**: Highly concentrated salt water that is a byproduct of the desalination process.
- **Reverse osmosis (RO)**: A water purification process that uses a partially permeable membrane to separate ions, unwanted molecules, and larger particles from drinking water.
- **Topography**: The arrangement of the natural and artificial physical features of an area.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Site Selection Criteria Diagram**:
   A circular diagram with "Ideal Desalination Site" in the center, surrounded by five equally spaced criteria:
   - Proximity to water source and demand centers
   - Topography and land availability
   - Energy access and infrastructure
   - Environmental sensitivity
   - Social and cultural considerations

2. **EIA Process Flowchart**:
   A linear flowchart showing the steps of an Environmental Impact Assessment:
   1. Screening
   2. Scoping
   3. Impact analysis
   4. Mitigation measures
   5. Reporting
   6. Review
   7. Decision-making
   8. Monitoring and follow-up

3. **Economic Feasibility Components**:
   A pyramid diagram showing the components of economic feasibility, with the base representing the most fundamental aspects:
   - Base: Capital costs and operational costs
   - Middle: Funding sources and financial models
   - Top: Cost-benefit analysis

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Site Selection Criteria Checklist**:
   A table with columns for criteria, importance rating, and notes. Criteria include:
   - Distance from coastline
   - Elevation
   - Available land area
   - Proximity to power grid
   - Distance from sensitive ecosystems
   - Cultural significance of the area

2. **Mini EIA Worksheet**:
   A two-column table with "Potential Environmental Impacts" on the left and "Proposed Mitigation Measures" on the right. Include space for at least 5 entries.

3. **Stakeholder Analysis Matrix**:
   A table with columns for stakeholder group, interests, potential impact on the project, and engagement strategy.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality" - World Health Organization
2. "Desalination: A National Perspective" - National Academies Press
3. "Environmental Impact Assessment of Seawater Desalination Plants" - Springer
4. "Stakeholder Engagement: A Good Practice Handbook for Companies Doing Business in Emerging Markets" - International Finance Corporation
5. Online course: "Water Supply and Sanitation Policy in Developing Countries" - University of Manchester on Coursera

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may lack background knowledge about Timor-Leste's geography and water resources.
   **Solution**: Provide a brief overview of Timor-Leste's geography and water challenges at the beginning of the lesson. Consider assigning pre-reading about the country's water situation.

2. **Challenge**: The economic feasibility analysis may be difficult for students without a finance background.
   **Solution**: Simplify the economic concepts and provide a basic template for cost-benefit analysis. Focus on the importance of considering both CAPEX and OPEX.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with the technical aspects of desalination technology.
   **Solution**: Use simple diagrams and analogies to explain the basic principles of desalination. Provide a glossary of technical terms.

4. **Challenge**: The role-play exercise may be challenging for shy students.
   **Solution**: Provide clear role descriptions and talking points for each stakeholder. Consider allowing students to work in pairs for their roles to boost confidence.

5. **Challenge**: Students may have difficulty relating to the local context of Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Use plenty of local examples, photos, and case studies. If possible, invite a guest speaker from Timor-Leste or someone with experience working in the country's water sector.
