# Support Material for System Design and Integration Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Reverse osmosis (RO): A water purification process that uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove ions, molecules, and larger particles from drinking water
- Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels: Devices that convert sunlight into electricity
- Energy recovery device: A system that captures and reuses energy from the high-pressure brine stream in an RO system
- Brine rejection: The process of removing concentrated salt solution from the RO system
- Pretreatment: Processes used to remove suspended solids and other contaminants before the RO process
- Post-treatment: Processes used to adjust the quality of the desalinated water after the RO process
- Off-grid system: A self-contained system not connected to the main electrical grid
- Membrane: A thin layer of material that selectively allows certain substances to pass through while blocking others
- Feed water: The input water to be treated by the RO system
- Permeate: The purified water that passes through the RO membrane
- Recovery rate: The percentage of feed water that is converted into permeate

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with technical calculations
   - Tip: Provide step-by-step examples and encourage peer tutoring

2. Challenge: Limited understanding of local context
   - Tip: Invite guest speakers from local water authorities or NGOs to share insights

3. Challenge: Difficulty visualizing system components
   - Tip: Use physical models or 3D-printed components to demonstrate functionality

4. Challenge: Varying levels of computer literacy for design software
   - Tip: Pair students with different skill levels and provide extra resources for self-paced learning

5. Challenge: Connecting theoretical knowledge to practical application
   - Tip: Organize hands-on activities with small-scale RO components and emphasize real-world case studies

6. Challenge: Addressing cultural sensitivities around water use
   - Tip: Facilitate open discussions about local water practices and encourage students to incorporate cultural considerations into their designs
