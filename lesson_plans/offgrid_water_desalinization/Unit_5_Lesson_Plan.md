# Lesson Plan: Environmental and Social Considerations in Desalination

## 1. Resources Needed

- Textbook: "Introduction to Desalination: Systems, Processes and Environmental Impacts" by Alireza Bazargan
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on brine management techniques
- Sample environmental impact reports
- Community survey templates

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the environmental impacts of desalination, particularly brine disposal
- Describe energy efficiency measures in desalination plants
- Discuss the importance of community engagement in desalination projects
- Design a basic environmental impact report
- Create a community survey for a desalination project

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show images of marine environments before and after brine disposal
- Ask students to discuss in pairs what they observe and potential impacts

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

- Brine: Highly concentrated salt solution resulting from desalination
- Hypersalinity: Excessive saltiness in water bodies
- Carbon footprint: Total greenhouse gas emissions caused by an individual, event, organization, or product
- Stakeholder engagement: Process of involving people who may be affected by the decisions of a project

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### a. Environmental Impacts of Desalination
- Brine disposal methods and their effects on marine ecosystems
- Energy consumption and associated carbon emissions
- Chemical usage and potential for pollution

### b. Energy Efficiency in Desalination
- Importance of reducing energy consumption
- Energy recovery devices in reverse osmosis systems
- Integration of renewable energy sources

### c. Community Engagement and Social Considerations
- Importance of local acceptance for project success
- Methods of community consultation
- Addressing cultural concerns and traditional water practices

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Group activity: Brainstorm solutions for brine management in Timor-Leste
- Pair work: Analyze an energy consumption chart of a desalination plant and suggest improvements

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

- Individual task: Write an outline for an environmental impact report for a small-scale desalination project
- Group task: Design a community survey to assess local attitudes towards a proposed desalination plant

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key concepts covered
- Open floor for questions and clarifications

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Complete the environmental impact report outline started in class
- Research and write a one-page summary on a successful community engagement strategy used in a water infrastructure project (can be from any country)

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Brine: A highly concentrated solution of salt in water, typically a byproduct of desalination processes.
- Hypersalinity: A condition where water has a higher salt concentration than normal seawater.
- Carbon footprint: The total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide (CO2).
- Stakeholder engagement: The process by which an organization involves people who may be affected by the decisions it makes or can influence the implementation of its decisions.
- Environmental impact assessment: A process of evaluating the likely environmental impacts of a proposed project or development, taking into account inter-related socio-economic, cultural and human-health impacts, both beneficial and adverse.
