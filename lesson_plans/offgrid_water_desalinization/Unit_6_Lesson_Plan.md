# Lesson Plan: Project Implementation and Management

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts on basic RO plant components and operation
- Sample O&M manuals for small-scale desalination plants
- Flipcharts and colored markers for group activities

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Outline key steps in desalination project implementation
- Identify essential components of an operator training program
- Develop a basic maintenance schedule for a small-scale RO plant
- Create a simplified O&M manual for local operators

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Students reflect on challenges they might face when implementing a desalination project in a remote Timorese village. They share ideas with a partner, then with the class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Commissioning
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Preventive maintenance
- Troubleshooting
- Logbook

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### a. Project Implementation Steps
- Site preparation and construction
- Equipment installation
- System testing and commissioning
- Operator training
- Handover to local community

### b. Operator Training Program Components
- Basic water chemistry and desalination principles
- RO system components and their functions
- Daily operation procedures
- Water quality testing and monitoring
- Basic troubleshooting techniques
- Safety protocols

### c. Maintenance Requirements
- Daily, weekly, monthly, and annual maintenance tasks
- Importance of preventive maintenance
- Record-keeping and reporting

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### a. Group Activity: Designing a Training Module (20 minutes)
- Divide class into groups of 3-4
- Each group designs a 1-hour training module on a specific aspect of RO plant operation (e.g., membrane cleaning, water quality testing)
- Groups present their module outlines to the class

### b. Individual Activity: Creating a Maintenance Schedule (20 minutes)
- Provide a list of common maintenance tasks for a small-scale RO plant
- Students create a weekly and monthly maintenance schedule, considering local constraints

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

### Creating an O&M Manual Section
- Students work in pairs to create a section of an O&M manual for local operators
- Topics may include: daily start-up procedure, water quality testing, or basic troubleshooting
- Emphasis on clear, simple language and use of visuals

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key implementation and maintenance concepts
- Address any questions or concerns raised during the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Develop a complete mock training program outline for local operators of a small-scale RO plant in Timor-Leste, including:
  * Training objectives
  * Topics to be covered
  * Training methods and activities
  * Duration of each module
  * Required resources

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Commissioning: The process of testing and verifying that all systems and components of the desalination plant are installed, tested, and operating according to design specifications.
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Detailed, written instructions that describe how to perform a routine or repetitive activity in an organization.
- Preventive maintenance: Regular, routine maintenance performed on equipment to reduce the likelihood of failures and to maintain optimal performance.
- Troubleshooting: The process of identifying and resolving problems or issues in a system or piece of equipment.
- Logbook: A record of important events, observations, and data related to the operation and maintenance of the desalination plant.
