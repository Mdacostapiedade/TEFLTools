# Discussion Questions

1. What are the most critical factors to consider when preparing a site for a desalination plant in a remote Timorese village?

2. How can we ensure that the operator training program is effective and culturally appropriate for local Timorese communities?

3. What challenges might arise during the handover of a desalination project to a local community, and how can these be addressed?

4. How can we incorporate traditional water management practices into the operation and maintenance of a modern desalination plant?

5. What are the potential environmental impacts of brine disposal in coastal Timor-Leste, and how can these be mitigated?

6. How can we design a maintenance schedule that balances the need for regular upkeep with the limited resources available in remote areas?

7. What role should local government play in the long-term sustainability of community-operated desalination plants?

8. How can we ensure that water quality testing and monitoring are consistently carried out in areas with limited access to laboratory facilities?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Creating an O&M Manual Section

1. Choose one of the following topics for your O&M manual section:
   - Daily start-up procedure
   - Water quality testing routine
   - Basic troubleshooting guide

2. Write a clear, concise introduction explaining the importance of the chosen topic.

3. Break down the procedure or information into simple, numbered steps.

4. Use simple language, avoiding technical jargon where possible. When technical terms are necessary, provide clear definitions.

5. Include relevant diagrams or illustrations to support the text. These can be hand-drawn if needed.

6. Add safety warnings or important notes where appropriate, using bold text or boxes to make them stand out.

7. Conclude with a brief summary and any additional resources or references that may be helpful.

8. Your manual section should be 2-3 pages long, including any diagrams or illustrations.

# Assignment Details

## Developing a Mock Training Program for Local Operators

1. Create a comprehensive outline for a training program designed for local operators of a small-scale RO desalination plant in Timor-Leste.

2. Your outline should include:
   - Overall training objectives
   - List of topics to be covered
   - Training methods and activities for each topic
   - Duration of each module or session
   - Required resources (e.g., equipment, materials, handouts)

3. Consider the following when developing your program:
   - Educational background of typical local operators
   - Language considerations (use of Tetum or other local languages)
   - Cultural aspects that may influence learning styles or content delivery
   - Limited resources and technology in remote areas
   - Importance of hands-on, practical training

4. Include at least one interactive activity or simulation for each major topic.

5. Develop a simple assessment method to evaluate the effectiveness of the training.

6. Create a sample daily schedule for the training program.

7. Your final submission should be 5-7 pages long and include:
   - A brief introduction explaining the context and importance of the training program

## Troubleshooting Flowchart Example

[A simple flowchart showing steps to diagnose and address low water production:
1. Check feed pressure → If low, inspect and clean prefilters
2. Check membrane differential pressure → If high, perform membrane cleaning
3. Check permeate TDS → If high, check for membrane damage or o-ring issues
4. If problems persist, consult manufacturer or technical support]
