# Lesson Plan: Case Studies and Future Prospects in Desalination

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with internet access for each student or group
- Projector and screen
- Whiteboard and markers
- Printed handouts of case studies
- Access to online desalination journals and publications
- Textbook: "Introduction to Desalination: Systems, Processes and Environmental Impacts" by Alireza Bazargan

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Analyze real-world desalination projects and their applicability to Timor-Leste
- Identify emerging technologies in desalination and assess their potential for local implementation
- Develop strategies for integrating desalination into climate change adaptation plans

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students answer 5 multiple-choice questions about basic desalination concepts covered in previous units
- Brief discussion of answers to refresh key points

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Forward osmosis
- Capacitive deionization
- Membrane distillation
- Aquifer recharge
- Water stress index

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of successful desalination projects in contexts similar to Timor-Leste
  * Case study 1: Small-scale RO plant in Pacific island nation
  * Case study 2: Solar-powered desalination in coastal African community
- Emerging technologies in desalination
  * Forward osmosis and its potential applications
  * Advancements in membrane technology
  * Energy recovery systems
- Climate change impacts on water resources in Timor-Leste
  * Projected changes in rainfall patterns
  * Sea level rise and saltwater intrusion
  * Role of desalination in adaptation strategies

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

- Small group analysis: Each group is assigned a case study to analyze, focusing on:
  * Technology used
  * Project scale and cost
  * Environmental and social impacts
  * Lessons learned and applicability to Timor-Leste
- Groups present their findings to the class (5 minutes each)

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Individual task: Students research an emerging desalination technology and create a one-page brief on its potential application in Timor-Leste
- Pair-share: Students exchange briefs and provide feedback to each other

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Class discussion: Key takeaways from case studies and emerging technologies
- Quick recap of climate change adaptation strategies involving desalination

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Begin group project: "Vision for Sustainable Water Supply in Timor-Leste"
  * Groups of 3-4 students
  * Develop a 10-year plan integrating desalination into Timor-Leste's water management strategy
  * Consider technological, environmental, social, and economic factors
  * Prepare a 15-minute presentation for next class

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Forward osmosis: A membrane-based desalination process that uses osmotic pressure differentials to separate water from salt
- Capacitive deionization: An electrochemical method for removing salt ions from water using electrically charged electrodes
- Membrane distillation: A thermally driven separation process where only vapor molecules transfer through a microporous hydrophobic membrane
- Aquifer recharge: The process of adding water to an aquifer, often as a method of storing freshwater for future use
- Water stress index: A measure of the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies
