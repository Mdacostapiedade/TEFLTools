- Increased water security during drought periods
- Reduced reliance on rainwater harvesting
- Improved water quality for drinking and sanitation

### Lessons Learned
- Importance of community engagement in project planning
- Need for ongoing operator training and capacity building
- Challenges in brine disposal in sensitive marine environments

## Case Study 2: Solar-powered Desalination in Coastal African Community

A solar-powered desalination project was implemented in Kiunga, Kenya, in 2018 to provide fresh water to a remote coastal village.

### Background
- Population: 3,500
- Fresh water sources: Brackish wells, unreliable rainwater
