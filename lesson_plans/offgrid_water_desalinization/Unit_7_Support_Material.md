Here's the support material for the lesson plan, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Lesson: Case Studies and Future Prospects in Desalination

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Forward osmosis: A membrane-based desalination process that uses osmotic pressure differentials to separate water from salt
- Capacitive deionization: An electrochemical method for removing salt ions from water using electrically charged electrodes
- Membrane distillation: A thermally driven separation process where only vapor molecules transfer through a microporous hydrophobic membrane
- Aquifer recharge: The process of adding water to an aquifer, often as a method of storing freshwater for future use
- Water stress index: A measure of the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies
- Reverse osmosis (RO): A water purification process that uses a partially permeable membrane to separate ions, unwanted molecules, and larger particles from drinking water
- Brine: Highly concentrated salt water that is a byproduct of desalination processes
- Energy recovery device: A system used in desalination plants to recover and reuse energy from the high-pressure brine stream

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Diagram: "Comparison of Desalination Technologies"
   - A flowchart comparing reverse osmosis, forward osmosis, and membrane distillation, highlighting key differences in process, energy requirements, and output quality

2. Infographic: "Climate Change Impacts on Water Resources in Timor-Leste"
   - Visual representation of projected changes in rainfall patterns, sea level rise, and saltwater intrusion, with icons and brief text explanations

3. Map: "Potential Desalination Sites in Timor-Leste"
   - A map of Timor-Leste's coastline with markers indicating suitable locations for desalination plants based on factors like population density, water scarcity, and energy availability

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Case Study Analysis Worksheet
   - Template for students to fill out during group analysis activity
   - Sections include: Technology Used, Project Scale and Cost, Environmental and Social Impacts, Lessons Learned, Applicability to Timor-Leste

2. Emerging Technology Research Brief Template
   - One-page template for students to complete their individual research task
   - Sections include: Technology Name, Brief Description, Advantages, Disadvantages, Potential Applications in Timor-Leste

3. Climate Change Adaptation Strategies Checklist
   - List of potential strategies for integrating desalination into climate change adaptation plans
   - Students check off relevant strategies and add notes on implementation

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Journal Articles:
   - "Recent developments in forward osmosis: Opportunities and challenges" by Tai-Shung Chung et al. (2012)
   - "A review of renewable energy technologies integrated with desalination systems" by Ali Al-Karaghouli and Lawrence L. Kazmerski (2013)

2. Online Resources:
   - International Desalination Association (IDA) website: www.idadesal.org
   - UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education online courses: www.un-ihe.org/online-courses

3. Reports:
   - "Timor-Leste Water Sector Assessment and Roadmap" by Asian Development Bank (2018)
   - "Climate Change in Timor-Leste: Science, Impacts, Policy and Planning" by Seeds of Life (2016)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may struggle to relate global desalination case studies to Timor-Leste's specific context.
   - Solution: Encourage students to identify similarities and differences between case study locations and Timor-Leste. Provide additional context about Timor-Leste's geography, climate, and infrastructure to help students make connections.

2. Challenge: Technical vocabulary may be overwhelming for some students.
   - Solution: Create a word wall in the classroom with key terms and their definitions. Encourage students to use the vocabulary in their discussions and written work to reinforce learning.

3. Challenge: Students may have varying levels of prior knowledge about climate change impacts.
   - Solution: Conduct a brief pre-assessment to gauge students' understanding. Provide supplementary materials or mini-lessons for students who need additional background information.

4. Challenge: Group work dynamics may be uneven during case study analysis.
   - Solution: Assign roles within each group (e.g., facilitator, note-taker, presenter) to ensure equal participation. Rotate between groups to provide support and encourage discussion.

5. Challenge: Students may find it difficult to envision long-term water management strategies.
   - Solution: Use visual aids like timelines and scenario planning exercises to help students conceptualize long-term planning. Invite guest speakers from local water management agencies to share real-world experiences.
