## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barrier**: 
   - Challenge: Students may struggle with English terms or concepts.
   - Solution: Provide key terms in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and real-life examples to explain complex concepts.

2. **Limited Technology Access**: 
   - Challenge: Not all students may have access to internet-connected devices.
   - Solution: Prepare printed materials as backups. Encourage group work to share resources.

3. **Connecting Global Concepts to Local Context**: 
   - Challenge: Students might find it difficult to relate global issues to their local experiences.
   - Solution: Use plenty of local examples and encourage students to share personal observations about changes in their environment or community.

4. **Varying Levels of Prior Knowledge**: 
   - Challenge: Students may have different levels of understanding about environmental issues.
   - Solution: Start with basic concepts and gradually introduce more complex ideas. Use peer teaching to leverage students' diverse knowledge.

5. **Engaging with Abstract Concepts**: 
   - Challenge: The idea of "Spaceship Earth" may be too abstract for some students.
   - Solution: Use hands-on activities, role-playing, and real-world simulations to make the concept more tangible.

6. **Maintaining Cultural Sensitivity**: 
   - Challenge: Balancing global perspectives with respect for local traditions and values.
   - Solution: Incorporate traditional Timorese knowledge and practices into discussions about sustainability and resource management.

7. **Encouraging Critical Thinking**: 
   - Challenge: Students may be used to rote learning rather than critical analysis.
   - Solution: Use open-ended questions, encourage debate, and validate diverse viewpoints to foster critical thinking skills.
