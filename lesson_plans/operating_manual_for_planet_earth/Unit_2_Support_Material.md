## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language barriers**: Ensure key concepts are explained in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and practical examples to reinforce understanding.

2. **Limited access to technology**: Prepare alternative non-digital activities or group students to share available resources. Encourage students to use smartphones if available.

3. **Varying levels of prior knowledge**: Begin with a brief assessment to gauge students' understanding. Use peer teaching to help bridge knowledge gaps.

4. **Resistance to new concepts**: Connect new ideas to familiar local practices and traditions. Emphasize the value of combining traditional and modern approaches.

5. **Difficulty in applying abstract concepts**: Use local, concrete examples and hands-on activities to make concepts more relatable and practical.

6. **Limited awareness of global issues**: Gradually introduce global concepts by first focusing on regional and national examples, then expanding to international contexts.

7. **Cultural sensitivities**: Be aware of local customs and taboos. Consult with community elders or leaders when discussing traditional knowledge or practices.

8. **Encouraging critical thinking**: Use open-ended questions and problem-solving activities to promote analytical skills. Create a safe space for students to express and debate ideas.
