# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth" by R. Buckminster Fuller

"The Great Pirates came into each of the various lands where there were no previous shipping operations and they said to the local king or chief, 'How would you like to have a ship of your own?' And the king would say, 'Fine.' Then the Great Pirates would say, 'If you'll let me have a franchise to operate from your shores and to have your backing in my business, I'll not only build you a ship, but I'll go to sea in it for you.' And the king would say, 'You've got yourself a deal.' So the Great Pirates would build him a ship. Each time they would select the smartest young man around to be the local king's skipper. The Great Pirates trained him in navigation and trained him in the ship's operation. They gave him a crew and said, 'You're to bring back a full ship.' And the local king's ship captain would come back with the full ship and the local king would be delighted. And the Great Pirate would say, 'Well, you see how rich you're getting. Let's build more ships.' And the king would agree, and more ships were built."

# Lecture Notes

## Historical Development of Specialization

1. Early human societies
   - Generalist hunter-gatherers
   - Gradual development of specialized roles (e.g., toolmakers, healers)

2. Agricultural revolution
   - Specialization in farming techniques
   - Emergence of non-food-producing specialists (e.g., artisans, traders)

3. Industrial revolution
   - Rapid increase in specialized jobs
   - Division of labor in factories

4. Modern era
   - Highly specialized professions
   - Interdependence of global economies

## The Great Pirates and Global Trade

1. Fuller's concept of the Great Pirates
   - Powerful individuals controlling global resources and trade
   - Operated outside national boundaries

2. Impact on specialization
   - Encouraged local specialization in different regions
   - Facilitated exchange of specialized goods and knowledge

3. Legacy in modern global trade
   - Multinational corporations as modern "Great Pirates"
   - Influence on global supply chains and specialization

## Timor-Leste's Traditional Knowledge Systems

1. Agricultural practices
   - Terraced farming techniques
   - Crop rotation and intercropping methods

2. Traditional crafts
   - Tais weaving
   - Pottery and basketry

3. Healing practices
   - Medicinal plant knowledge
   - Traditional birth attendants (daia)

4. Oral traditions
   - Storytelling and folklore
   - Preservation of historical and cultural knowledge

## Modern Education in Timor-Leste

1. Historical context
   - Portuguese colonial education system
   - Indonesian occupation and education policies
   - Post-independence education reforms

2. Current education system
   - Structure (primary, secondary, tertiary)
   - Language of instruction challenges (Tetum, Portuguese, Indonesian)

3. Challenges
   - Limited resources and infrastructure
   - Teacher training and retention
   - Balancing traditional knowledge with modern curricula

4. Opportunities
   - Increasing access to higher education
   - Integration of technology in learning
   - Potential for preserving traditional knowledge through formal education

# Discussion Questions

1. How has specialization impacted the development of Timor-Leste since independence?
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of preserving traditional knowledge systems in Timor-Leste?
3. How can Timor-Leste balance the need for modern education with the preservation of traditional knowledge?
4. In what ways might Fuller's concept of the "Great Pirates" be relevant to Timor-Leste's position in global trade today?
5. How has specialization in education affected job opportunities for young people in Timor-Leste?
6. What role can traditional knowledge play in addressing modern challenges in Timor-Leste, such as climate change adaptation?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay comparing and contrasting the transmission of knowledge in traditional Timorese society with the modern education system. Consider the following points:

1. Methods of teaching and learning
2. Types of knowledge valued in each system
3. Roles of teachers/elders and students
4. Practical applications of knowledge
5. Preservation and adaptation of knowledge over time

Use specific examples from Timorese culture and history to support your arguments. Conclude with your thoughts on how Timor-Leste might best integrate traditional and modern approaches to education.
