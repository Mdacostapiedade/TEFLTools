# Lesson Plan: Spaceship Earth's Life Support Systems

## Resources Needed
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts with diagrams of global environmental cycles
- Field trip materials (notebooks, pens, cameras)
- Art supplies for biomimicry project

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Describe at least three global environmental cycles
2. Identify three critical ecosystems in Timor-Leste
3. Explain the concept of ecosystem services
4. Apply biomimicry principles to design a sustainable community project

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Show a short video clip of Earth from space
- Ask students to write down three things that make Earth unique as a "spaceship"
- Discuss responses as a class

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)
- Introduce and define key terms:
  * Ecosystem
  * Biodiversity
  * Carbon cycle
  * Water cycle
  * Nutrient cycle
  * Ecosystem services
  * Biomimicry
- Use visual aids and examples relevant to Timor-Leste for each term

## Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)
1. Global Environmental Cycles (20 minutes)
   - Present an overview of the carbon, water, and nutrient cycles
   - Explain how these cycles support life on Earth
   - Discuss human impacts on these cycles

2. Timor-Leste's Critical Ecosystems (25 minutes)
   - Introduce key ecosystems: mangrove forests, coral reefs, tropical forests
   - Explain the biodiversity found in each ecosystem
   - Discuss ecosystem services provided by each (e.g., coastal protection, fish habitat, carbon sequestration)

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)
1. Ecosystem Matching Game
   - Students match ecosystem types with their characteristics and services
2. Cycle Diagram Completion
   - Students complete partially filled diagrams of environmental cycles

## Production Task (60 minutes)
Field Trip to Local Ecosystem
- Visit a nearby mangrove forest or coral reef
- Students observe and document:
  * Plant and animal species
  * Signs of human impact
  * Potential ecosystem services

## Wrap-up and Review (20 minutes)
- Class discussion on field trip observations
- Quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson

## Homework Assignment
Design a Sustainable Community Project
- Students apply biomimicry principles to design a solution for a local environmental challenge
- Prepare a poster or short presentation for next class

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
1. Ecosystem: A community of living organisms interacting with their environment
2. Biodiversity: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat
3. Carbon cycle: The process by which carbon atoms circulate through the Earth's systems
4. Water cycle: The continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere
5. Nutrient cycle: The movement and recycling of nutrients within an ecosystem
6. Ecosystem services: Benefits provided by ecosystems to humans
7. Biomimicry: Design and production of materials, structures, and systems modeled on biological entities and processes
