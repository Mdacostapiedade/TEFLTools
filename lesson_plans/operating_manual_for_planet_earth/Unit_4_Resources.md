## Global Environmental Cycles

### Carbon Cycle
- Definition: The biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.
- Key components:
  * Atmosphere: CO2
  * Biosphere: Plants and animals
  * Hydrosphere: Oceans and water bodies
  * Lithosphere: Rocks and sediments
- Processes:
  * Photosynthesis: Plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere
  * Respiration: Plants and animals release CO2
  * Decomposition: Organic matter releases CO2
  * Ocean absorption: Oceans absorb and release CO2
  * Fossil fuel combustion: Human activities release stored carbon

### Water Cycle
- Definition: The continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere.
- Key components:
  * Evaporation: Water turns into vapor
  * Transpiration: Plants release water vapor
  * Condensation: Water vapor forms clouds
  * Precipitation: Rain, snow, or hail falls to Earth
  * Runoff: Water flows over land to rivers and oceans
  * Infiltration: Water seeps into the ground
- Importance:
  * Regulates Earth's temperature
  * Supports all life forms
  * Shapes landscapes through erosion and deposition

### Nutrient Cycle
- Definition: The movement and recycling of nutrients within an ecosystem.
- Key nutrients:
  * Nitrogen
  * Phosphorus
  * Potassium
- Processes:
  * Decomposition: Breaks down organic matter
  * Mineralization: Converts organic nutrients to inorganic forms
  * Nutrient uptake: Plants absorb nutrients from soil
  * Nitrogen fixation: Conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to usable forms

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Ecosystem Services Essay

Write a 500-word essay on the ecosystem services provided by one of Timor-Leste's critical ecosystems (mangrove forests, coral reefs, or tropical forests). Your essay should include:

1. An introduction explaining the chosen ecosystem and its importance to Timor-Leste.
2. A detailed description of at least three ecosystem services provided by the chosen ecosystem.
3. An explanation of how these services benefit local communities and the country as a whole.
4. A discussion of current threats to the ecosystem and potential conservation strategies.
5. A conclusion summarizing the importance of preserving the ecosystem for future generations.

Use specific examples and, where possible, include relevant data or statistics to support your arguments. Cite any sources used in your essay.

# Assignment Details

## Biomimicry Community Project Design

Design a sustainable community project for Timor-Leste using biomimicry principles. Your project should address a specific environmental or social challenge faced by a community in Timor-Leste.

Requirements:
1. Identify a specific challenge (e.g., water scarcity, soil erosion, waste management).
2. Research natural systems or organisms that have solved similar challenges.
3. Develop a project proposal that applies biomimicry principles to address the challenge.
4. Create a visual representation of your project (e.g., poster, digital presentation, or physical model).
5. Prepare a 5-minute presentation explaining your project, including:
   - The challenge addressed
   - The natural system or organism that inspired your solution
   - How your project works
   - Potential benefits to the community
   - Considerations for implementation

Your project will be evaluated based on:
- Creativity and innovation
- Relevance to Timor-Leste's context
- Effective application of biomimicry principles
- Feasibility and potential impact
- Quality of presentation and visual aids

## Case Study: Mangrove Restoration in Timor-Leste

The coastal village of Hera, located east of Dili, has experienced significant mangrove loss due to urbanization and aquaculture development. This has led to increased coastal erosion and decreased fish populations, affecting local livelihoods.

In 2015, a community-led mangrove restoration project was initiated with support from local NGOs and the government. The project involved:

1. Community education on the importance of mangroves
2. Establishment of a mangrove nursery
3. Replanting of mangrove seedlings
4. Creation of alternative livelihood options to reduce pressure on mangroves

Results after five years:
- 20 hectares of mangroves restored
- Increased fish and crab populations
- Reduced coastal erosion
- Development of eco-tourism opportunities

Lessons learned:
- Community involvement is crucial for long-term success
- Combining restoration with alternative livelihoods enhances sustainability
- Ongoing monitoring and adaptive management are necessary

Use this case study to discuss potential applications of ecosystem restoration in other parts of Timor-Leste.
