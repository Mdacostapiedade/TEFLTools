# Support Material for Spaceship Earth's Life Support Systems Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

1. Ecosystem: A community of living organisms interacting with their environment
2. Biodiversity: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat
3. Carbon cycle: The process by which carbon atoms circulate through the Earth's systems
4. Water cycle: The continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere
5. Nutrient cycle: The movement and recycling of nutrients within an ecosystem
6. Ecosystem services: Benefits provided by ecosystems to humans
7. Biomimicry: Design and production of materials, structures, and systems modeled on biological entities and processes
8. Mangrove forest: Coastal ecosystem of salt-tolerant trees growing in intertidal zones
9. Coral reef: Underwater ecosystem built by colonies of tiny animals called coral polyps
10. Tropical forest: Dense forest found near the equator with high biodiversity and rainfall

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Earth from Space Image: A high-resolution image of Earth as seen from space, highlighting the blue oceans, green landmasses, and white cloud patterns.

2. Global Environmental Cycles Diagrams:
   - Carbon Cycle: Diagram showing the movement of carbon through atmosphere, plants, animals, soil, and oceans
   - Water Cycle: Illustration of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and water storage in various forms
   - Nutrient Cycle: Diagram depicting the flow of nutrients through producers, consumers, decomposers, and the environment

3. Timor-Leste Ecosystem Map: A map of Timor-Leste highlighting the locations of key ecosystems (mangrove forests, coral reefs, tropical forests)

4. Ecosystem Services Infographic: Visual representation of various ecosystem services provided by Timor-Leste's critical ecosystems

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Ecosystem Matching Game:
   - Table with three columns: Ecosystem Type, Characteristics, and Ecosystem Services
   - Students match items from a list to the correct ecosystem

2. Cycle Diagram Completion:
   - Partially completed diagrams of the carbon, water, and nutrient cycles
   - Students fill in missing labels and arrows

3. Field Trip Observation Sheet:
   - Sections for recording plant and animal species observed
   - Checklist for signs of human impact
   - Space to note potential ecosystem services

4. Biomimicry Design Challenge:
   - Worksheet guiding students through the process of identifying a local environmental challenge
   - Prompts for brainstorming nature-inspired solutions
   - Template for sketching and describing their sustainable community project design

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Timor-Leste's National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2011-2020)"
2. "The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB)" report
3. Biomimicry Institute website (https://biomimicry.org/)
4. "Coral Reefs of Timor-Leste: Ecology, Management and Conservation" by J. Penny Holthus
5. "Mangroves for the Future" initiative resources (https://www.mangrovesforthefuture.org/)
6. Interactive online simulations of environmental cycles (e.g., PhET simulations)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barrier:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle with scientific terminology in English
   - Solution: Provide key terms in both English and Tetum, use visual aids, and encourage peer explanations

2. Limited Prior Knowledge:
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of understanding about global environmental systems
   - Solution: Start with a basic assessment and adjust the lesson depth accordingly; use local examples to build on existing knowledge

3. Abstract Concepts:
   - Challenge: Some students may find it difficult to grasp the interconnectedness of global systems
   - Solution: Use hands-on activities, role-playing exercises, and real-world examples to make concepts more tangible

4. Limited Resources for Field Trips:
   - Challenge: Organizing field trips may be difficult due to logistical or financial constraints
   - Solution: Consider virtual field trips using videos and photos, or arrange for local experts to visit the classroom

5. Relating Global Concepts to Local Context:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle to see the relevance of global environmental cycles to their daily lives
   - Solution: Consistently draw connections between global processes and local impacts, use case studies from Timor-Leste

6. Engaging Students in Biomimicry:
   - Challenge: Students may find it difficult to apply biomimicry principles to real-world problems
   - Solution: Provide examples of successful biomimicry projects, start with simple challenges, and encourage creativity through brainstorming sessions

7. Time Management:
   - Challenge: Covering all aspects of the lesson within the allocated time
   - Solution: Prioritize key concepts, use a flexible approach to adjust activities based on student engagement and understanding, and consider extending the lesson over multiple sessions if necessary
