# Lesson Plan: Introduction to General Systems Theory

## Resources Needed
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts with diagrams of simple systems
- Large sheets of paper and colored markers for group work
- Copies of "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth" (Tetum translation if available)

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Define General Systems Theory and its key principles
2. Identify and describe the components of a system
3. Explain the concept of feedback loops in systems
4. Apply systems thinking to a local Timorese context

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Ask students to form small groups and brainstorm examples of systems they encounter in daily life (e.g., school system, transportation system, ecosystem)
- Have groups share their examples with the class and briefly explain why they consider them systems

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)
Write the following terms on the board and briefly explain each:
- System
- Interconnectedness
- Feedback loop
- Emergence
- Holistic thinking

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Introduction to General Systems Theory
   - Define General Systems Theory as a way of understanding complex systems by examining their components and interactions
   - Explain the historical context of systems thinking (von Bertalanffy, Meadows)

2. Key Principles of Systems Thinking
   - Interconnectedness: All parts of a system are connected
   - Feedback loops: Systems regulate themselves through positive and negative feedback
   - Emergence: Systems exhibit properties that arise from the interaction of their parts
   - Holistic perspective: Understanding the whole system is more important than focusing on individual parts

3. Components of a System
   - Elements: Individual parts of the system
   - Interconnections: Relationships between elements
   - Purpose: The function or goal of the system

4. Application to Timor-Leste
   - Discuss how systems thinking can be applied to understand and address complex issues in Timor-Leste (e.g., food security, environmental conservation, economic development)

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)
1. System Diagram Exercise (15 minutes)
   - Provide students with a simple system diagram (e.g., water cycle, food web)
   - Ask them to identify and label the elements, interconnections, and purpose of the system

2. Feedback Loop Identification (15 minutes)
   - Present a scenario relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., deforestation and soil erosion)
   - Have students work in pairs to identify potential positive and negative feedback loops in the scenario

## Production Task (40 minutes)
Systems Mapping Activity:
- Divide the class into groups of 4-5 students
- Assign each group a local community or industry in Timor-Leste (e.g., coffee farming, fishing village, urban neighborhood)
- Provide large sheets of paper and markers
- Task: Create a systems map of the assigned community or industry, identifying key elements, interconnections, and feedback loops
- Have each group present their systems map to the class

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
- Facilitate a class discussion on the insights gained from the systems mapping activity
- Review the key principles of systems thinking and their relevance to understanding Timor-Leste's development challenges

## Homework Assignment
1. Reading: Assign relevant chapters from "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth"
2. Systems Journal: Ask students to observe and document examples of systems in their daily lives over the next week, noting elements, interconnections, and potential feedback loops

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- System: A set of interconnected elements that form a complex whole
- Interconnectedness: The state of being connected or related to one another
- Feedback loop: A process in which the output of a system influences its input, creating a cycle of cause and effect
- Emergence: The appearance of complex properties or patterns that arise from simpler interactions within a system
- Holistic thinking: An approach that emphasizes understanding the whole system rather than just its individual parts
