# Support Material for Introduction to General Systems Theory

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **System**: A set of interconnected elements that form a complex whole
- **Interconnectedness**: The state of being connected or related to one another
- **Feedback loop**: A process in which the output of a system influences its input, creating a cycle of cause and effect
- **Emergence**: The appearance of complex properties or patterns that arise from simpler interactions within a system
- **Holistic thinking**: An approach that emphasizes understanding the whole system rather than just its individual parts
- **Element**: An individual part or component of a system
- **Purpose**: The function or goal of a system
- **Resilience**: The ability of a system to maintain its core purpose and integrity in the face of dramatically changed circumstances

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Simple System Diagram**
   Description: A circular diagram showing the basic components of a system:
   - Center circle: "System"
   - Three surrounding circles: "Elements", "Interconnections", "Purpose"
   - Arrows connecting all circles to show relationships

2. **Feedback Loop Diagram**
   Description: Two diagrams side by side:
   - Positive feedback loop: Reinforcing cycle with arrows showing growth
   - Negative feedback loop: Balancing cycle with arrows showing regulation

3. **Timor-Leste Systems Map**
   Description: A map of Timor-Leste with icons representing various systems:
   - Agriculture (coffee plants, rice fields)
   - Fishing (boats, fish)
   - Education (schools)
   - Healthcare (hospitals)
   - Government (parliament building)
   Arrows connecting these icons to show interconnections

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **System Identification Worksheet**
   Content:
   - List of 10 scenarios or situations
   - Columns for students to identify: Elements, Interconnections, Purpose
   - Space for drawing a simple system diagram for each scenario

2. **Feedback Loop Analysis**
   Content:
   - Description of a local environmental issue (e.g., deforestation in Timor-Leste)
   - Questions prompting students to identify potential positive and negative feedback loops
   - Space for students to draw and explain their identified feedback loops

3. **Systems Thinking Application**
   Content:
   - Brief case study of a Timorese community or industry
   - Guided questions to help students apply systems thinking principles
   - Template for creating a simple systems map of the case study

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Thinking in Systems: A Primer" by Donella H. Meadows
2. "The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization" by Peter M. Senge
3. "Systems Thinking for Social Change" by David Peter Stroh
4. Online course: "Systems Thinking in Public Health" on Coursera
5. The Systems Thinker website (https://thesystemsthinker.com/)
6. "Timor-Leste: Transforming Education Through Partnership in a Small Post-Conflict State" by Jude Butcher et al.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with abstract systems concepts.
   **Tip**: Use concrete, local examples that students can relate to. Start with simple systems before moving to more complex ones.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in identifying less obvious interconnections in systems.
   **Tip**: Encourage brainstorming and group discussions. Use guided questions to help students explore deeper connections.

3. **Challenge**: Students may focus too much on linear cause-and-effect thinking.
   **Tip**: Introduce feedback loops early and often. Use role-playing exercises to demonstrate circular causality.

4. **Challenge**: Applying systems thinking to real-world problems in Timor-Leste.
   **Tip**: Invite local experts or community leaders to share their perspectives on systemic issues. Organize field trips to observe systems in action.

5. **Challenge**: Language barriers in understanding systems terminology.
   **Tip**: Provide vocabulary lists in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and diagrams to reinforce concepts.

6. **Challenge**: Balancing traditional knowledge with systems thinking approaches.
   **Tip**: Explicitly draw connections between traditional Timorese problem-solving methods and systems thinking principles. Encourage students to interview elders about holistic approaches to community issues.
