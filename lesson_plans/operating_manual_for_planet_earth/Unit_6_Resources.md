# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth" by R. Buckminster Fuller

"Wealth is our organized capability to cope effectively with the environment in sustaining our healthy regeneration and decreasing both the physical and metaphysical restrictions of the forward days of our lives."

## Traditional Timorese Wealth Story: "The Tais of Prosperity"

In a small village in the mountains of Timor-Leste, there lived a weaver named Marta. She was known for her beautiful tais, the traditional woven cloth of Timor-Leste. Marta's tais were not just beautiful; they told stories of her community's history and values.

One day, a wealthy businessman from Dili visited the village. He saw Marta's tais and offered to buy all of them for a large sum of money. Marta refused, explaining that the tais were not for sale. They were meant to be given as gifts, to strengthen relationships within the community and to honor important life events.

The businessman couldn't understand why Marta would refuse such a profitable offer. He asked, "Don't you want to be wealthy?"

Marta smiled and replied, "I am already wealthy. I have the skills to create these tais, which bring joy and connection to my community. I have enough food from our communal gardens, a home built by our neighbors, and the support of my village. This is true wealth."

The businessman left, puzzled but intrigued. As he drove back to Dili, he began to reconsider his own definition of wealth.

# Assignment Details

## Community Wealth Assessment Tool Development

In groups of 3-4, create a comprehensive tool for assessing community wealth in Timor-Leste. Your tool should:

1. Incorporate both traditional Timorese and modern concepts of wealth
2. Include at least 10 distinct indicators of wealth, with a mix of quantitative and qualitative measures
3. Provide clear methods for data collection and analysis for each indicator
4. Consider how synergy between different forms of wealth can be identified and measured
5. Include a scoring or ranking system to evaluate overall community wealth
6. Address potential challenges in implementing the assessment tool
7. Suggest how the results of the assessment could be used to inform community development strategies

Deliverables:
- A detailed description of the assessment tool (2-3 pages)
- A visual representation of the tool (e.g., flowchart, infographic)
- A sample data collection form or questionnaire
- A brief implementation guide for using the tool in a Timorese community

# Additional Materials and Examples

## Case Study: Atauro Island Eco-Tourism Initiative

Atauro Island, located off the coast of Dili, has developed a community-based eco-tourism initiative that exemplifies synergetic wealth creation. The project:

- Preserves traditional fishing practices while creating new economic opportunities
- Protects marine ecosystems through community-managed marine protected areas
- Revitalizes traditional crafts by creating a market for locally-made souvenirs
- Improves English language skills among local youth through interaction with tourists
- Reinvests tourism revenue into community infrastructure and education

Analyze how this initiative creates synergies between different forms of wealth (natural, cultural, economic, and human capital) and discuss its potential as a model for sustainable development in other parts of Timor-Leste.

## Example: Traditional Wealth Indicators in Timor-Leste

1. Number of tais owned and gifted
2. Size and productivity of family gardens
3. Strength of kinship networks and alliances
4. Knowledge of traditional medicines and healing practices
5. Proficiency in local language and oral traditions
6. Participation in community rituals and ceremonies
7. Access to communal land and resources
8. Reputation and standing within the community
9. Ability to mediate conflicts and maintain harmony
10. Connection to ancestral lands and sacred sites

Consider how these traditional indicators might be integrated with modern economic measures to create a more holistic wealth assessment for Timorese communities.
