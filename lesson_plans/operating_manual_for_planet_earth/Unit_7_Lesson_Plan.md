# Lesson Plan: Regenerative Landscape in Timor-Leste

## Resources Needed

- Projector and computer
- Whiteboard and markers
- Large sheets of paper and art supplies
- Copies of Timor-Leste land use maps
- Handouts on regenerative design principles
- Samples of local plants and seeds (if available)

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Define regenerative design and its key principles
2. Identify at least three land use challenges in Timor-Leste
3. Propose regenerative solutions for a specific local land use issue
4. Create a vision for a sustainable Timor-Leste in 2050

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

1. Display images of degraded and thriving landscapes in Timor-Leste
2. Ask students to discuss in pairs:
   - What differences do you notice between these landscapes?
   - What factors might have caused these differences?
3. Share observations as a class

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

1. Introduce and define key terms:
   - Regenerative design
   - Ecosystem services
   - Permaculture
   - Agroforestry
   - Biodiversity
2. Have students create a vocabulary mind map, connecting these terms to related concepts

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduction to regenerative design:
   - Definition and core principles
   - Examples from around the world
2. Timor-Leste's land use challenges:
   - Deforestation
   - Soil erosion
   - Water scarcity
   - Loss of biodiversity
3. Opportunities for regenerative design in Timor-Leste:
   - Traditional ecological knowledge
   - Agroforestry systems
   - Watershed restoration
   - Sustainable agriculture practices

## Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Small group analysis (20 minutes):
   - Divide class into groups of 3-4
   - Assign each group a specific land use challenge in Timor-Leste
   - Groups research and brainstorm regenerative solutions
2. Gallery walk (20 minutes):
   - Groups create posters summarizing their findings
   - Students rotate to view and provide feedback on other groups' work

## Production Task (45 minutes)

Design a regenerative agriculture project:
1. Students work in pairs to design a small-scale regenerative agriculture project for a local community
2. Project designs should include:
   - Site analysis
   - Proposed interventions
   - Expected benefits
   - Implementation timeline
3. Students create a visual representation of their project (e.g., diagram, model, or digital presentation)

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

1. Each pair presents a 1-minute pitch of their regenerative agriculture project
2. Class votes on the most innovative and feasible project
3. Recap key principles of regenerative design and their relevance to Timor-Leste

## Homework Assignment

Create a vision board for a sustainable Timor-Leste in 2050:
1. Use images, words, and drawings to depict a future where regenerative design principles have been widely adopted
2. Include at least five specific examples of regenerative practices in different sectors (e.g., agriculture, energy, housing, transportation)
3. Write a short paragraph explaining your vision and the steps needed to achieve it

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Regenerative design: An approach that seeks to create systems that are not just sustainable, but which regenerate or revitalize their own sources of energy and materials.
- Ecosystem services: The benefits provided by ecosystems to humans, such as clean air, water, food, and climate regulation.
- Permaculture: A design approach for land use that works with natural ecosystems to create sustainable and productive environments.
- Agroforestry: A land use management system that combines trees or shrubs with crops or livestock.
- Biodiversity: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem.
