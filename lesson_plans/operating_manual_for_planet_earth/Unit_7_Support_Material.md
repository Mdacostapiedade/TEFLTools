Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Regenerative Landscape in Timor-Leste, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Regenerative Landscape in Timor-Leste Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Regenerative design**: An approach that seeks to create systems that are not just sustainable, but which regenerate or revitalize their own sources of energy and materials.
- **Ecosystem services**: The benefits provided by ecosystems to humans, such as clean air, water, food, and climate regulation.
- **Permaculture**: A design approach for land use that works with natural ecosystems to create sustainable and productive environments.
- **Agroforestry**: A land use management system that combines trees or shrubs with crops or livestock.
- **Biodiversity**: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem.
- **Watershed**: An area of land that drains water, sediment, and dissolved materials to a common outlet.
- **Soil erosion**: The wearing away of topsoil by natural forces such as wind and water.
- **Traditional ecological knowledge**: The knowledge, practices, and beliefs about the relationship between living beings and their environment, passed down through generations in indigenous communities.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

     - Loss of biodiversity (green patches)

3. **Agroforestry System Illustration**
   - A cross-section diagram showing:
     - Canopy layer (tall trees)
     - Understory layer (smaller trees and shrubs)
     - Ground cover (crops and herbs)
     - Root zone (showing diverse root systems)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language barriers**: 
   - Provide key terms in both English and Tetum
   - Use visual aids and hands-on activities to reinforce concepts

2. **Limited access to technology**:
   - Prepare printed materials as backup for digital presentations
   - Encourage hand-drawn designs and models

3. **Varying levels of prior knowledge**:
   - Start with a brief assessment to gauge students' understanding
   - Use peer teaching to leverage diverse knowledge levels

4. **Connecting global concepts to local context**:
   - Invite local experts or elders to share traditional knowledge
   - Use case studies from Timor-Leste or similar environments

5. **Encouraging critical thinking**:
   - Use open-ended questions and problem-solving scenarios
   - Promote group discussions and debates on complex issues

6. **Limited field trip opportunities**:
   - Bring samples of local plants and soil to the classroom
   - Use virtual tours or documentaries of relevant ecosystems

7. **Maintaining student engagement**:
   - Incorporate hands-on activities and group work
   - Connect lessons to students' daily lives and future aspirations

8. **Addressing potential conflicts with traditional practices**:
   - Emphasize the value of combining traditional and modern knowledge
   - Discuss how regenerative design can support cultural preservation
