# Lesson Plan: Comprehensive Automation in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Copies of relevant sections from "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth" by R. Buckminster Fuller
- Computers or tablets with internet access
- Projector and screen
- Whiteboard and markers
- Flip chart paper and colored markers
- Post-it notes

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain key concepts of automation and its global trends
- Analyze the potential impacts of automation on Timor-Leste's development
- Evaluate appropriate technologies for addressing local challenges
- Design a proposal for an innovative technology solution

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a set of post-it notes
- Ask students to brainstorm and write down as many examples of automation they encounter in daily life (one per post-it)
- Have groups share their examples and create a class mind map on the whiteboard

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Automation
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Appropriate technology
- Innovation
- Digital divide
- Technological leapfrogging

Use visual aids and examples relevant to Timor-Leste to reinforce understanding.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of global trends in automation and AI
- Discussion of technology adoption in developing countries
- Case studies of successful technology implementation in contexts similar to Timor-Leste
- Exploration of Timor-Leste's current technological landscape and challenges
- Introduction to the concept of appropriate technology for sustainable development

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

### Activity 1: Technology Impact Analysis
- In pairs, students choose a sector in Timor-Leste (e.g., agriculture, healthcare, education)
- Research and analyze potential impacts of automation on that sector
- Create a pros and cons list
- Share findings with the class

### Activity 2: Appropriate Technology Matching
- Provide students with a list of local challenges and a list of technologies
- In small groups, students match appropriate technologies to challenges
- Discuss reasoning behind choices

## 7. Production Task (60 minutes)

### Innovative Technology Proposal
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group identifies a local challenge in Timor-Leste
- Groups brainstorm and design an appropriate technology solution
- Create a brief proposal including:
  * Problem statement
  * Proposed solution
  * Expected benefits
  * Potential challenges
  * Implementation plan
- Present proposals to the class for feedback

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Facilitate a class discussion on the potential of automation and appropriate technology in Timor-Leste's development
- Address any remaining questions or concerns

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will:
1. Research an example of successful technology implementation in a developing country
2. Write a 500-word reflection on how a similar approach could be applied in Timor-Leste
3. Begin planning for the community technology fair (to be held in a future class)

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Automation: The use of largely automatic equipment in a system of manufacturing or other production process
- Artificial Intelligence (AI): The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems
- Appropriate technology: Technology that is suitable for the environmental, cultural, and economic conditions in which it is intended to be used
- Innovation: The introduction of new ideas, methods, or products
- Digital divide: The gap between those who have ready access to computers and the Internet, and those who do not
- Technological leapfrogging: The adoption of advanced or state-of-the-art technology in an application area where immediate prior technology has not been adopted
