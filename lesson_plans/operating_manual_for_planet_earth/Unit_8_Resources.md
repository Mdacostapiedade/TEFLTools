# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth" by R. Buckminster Fuller

"Automation is with us. There is no question about it. Automation was inevitable to intellect. Intellect was found to be most useful in the development of generalized principles. Generalized principles were found to be most useful in guiding automation. Intellect, which is uniquely capable of discovering and applying these principles, is now being emancipated by automation from the manual-muscle and reflex-monitoring tasks. The computer will continue to take over all the routine muscle and nerve operations of humans. The computer will go on to do all the routine tasks of the present-day office. The computer will also take over the routine sensorial and memory storing and retrieving functions of man's brain."
