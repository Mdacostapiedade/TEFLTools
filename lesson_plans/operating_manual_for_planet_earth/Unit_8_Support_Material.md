## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Limited student exposure to technology:
   - Begin with basic concepts and gradually increase complexity
   - Use relatable local examples whenever possible
   - Encourage hands-on exploration of available technology

2. Language barriers:
   - Provide key terms in both English and Tetum
   - Use visual aids to support explanations
   - Encourage peer translation and discussion

3. Skepticism about automation's relevance to Timor-Leste:
   - Highlight successful case studies from similar developing countries
   - Discuss how automation can address specific local challenges
   - Emphasize the importance of preparing for future technological changes

4. Lack of access to up-to-date information on global trends:
   - Prepare a curated list of reliable online resources
   - Invite guest speakers from local tech companies or NGOs
   - Encourage students to follow relevant social media accounts or newsletters

5. Difficulty in imagining innovative solutions:
   - Provide brainstorming techniques (e.g., SCAMPER, mind mapping)
   - Show examples of frugal innovation from other developing countries
   - Encourage interdisciplinary thinking by connecting technology to various sectors

6. Limited resources for hands-on activities:
   - Use role-playing and simulation exercises
   - Leverage free online tools and resources when possible
   - Partner with local businesses or organizations for equipment demonstrations

7. Balancing traditional values with technological advancement:
   - Discuss the concept of appropriate technology
   - Explore ways to integrate traditional knowledge with modern solutions
   - Encourage critical thinking about the social and cultural impacts of technology adoption
