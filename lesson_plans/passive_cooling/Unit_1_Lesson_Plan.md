# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Passive Cooling in Timor Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- PowerPoint presentation on passive cooling principles and Timor Leste climate
- Climate data for Timor Leste (temperature, humidity, wind patterns)
- Photos/videos of traditional Timorese buildings
- Handouts on heat transfer mechanisms
- Materials for climate data analysis exercise (graph paper, calculators)
- Transportation for field trip

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the basic principles of passive cooling
- Describe the key climate characteristics of Timor Leste
- Identify traditional cooling strategies used in Timorese architecture
- Analyze climate data to inform building design decisions

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to share their experiences with staying cool in Timor Leste without air conditioning
- List strategies on the board and briefly discuss which might be considered "passive cooling"

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  - Passive cooling
  - Heat transfer (conduction, convection, radiation)
  - Thermal comfort
  - Microclimate
  - Vernacular architecture

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

- Fundamentals of heat transfer and thermal comfort
  - Mechanisms of heat gain/loss in buildings
  - Factors affecting human thermal comfort
- Timor Leste's climate characteristics
  - Temperature and humidity patterns
  - Seasonal variations
  - Coastal vs. inland microclimates
- Traditional Timorese architecture and cooling strategies
  - Building forms and materials
  - Natural ventilation techniques
  - Shading and thermal mass strategies

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Climate data analysis exercise:
  - Students work in small groups to analyze temperature and humidity data for different regions of Timor Leste
  - Plot data on graphs and identify patterns
  - Discuss implications for building design in each region

## 7. Production Task (20 minutes)

- Students sketch and label a traditional Timorese building, identifying passive cooling features

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Address any questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 1-page summary of a passive cooling strategy used in another tropical country that could be applicable to Timor Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Passive cooling: Techniques to reduce indoor temperatures without mechanical air conditioning
- Heat transfer: Movement of thermal energy from one object or space to another
- Thermal comfort: State of mind expressing satisfaction with the thermal environment
- Microclimate: Local atmospheric conditions that differ from those in surrounding areas
- Vernacular architecture: Building style using local materials and traditions, adapted to climate
