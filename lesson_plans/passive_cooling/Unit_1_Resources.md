## Fundamentals of Heat Transfer and Thermal Comfort

### Heat Transfer Mechanisms

1. Conduction
   - Transfer of heat through direct contact between particles
   - Occurs in solids, liquids, and gases
   - Example: Heat moving through a wall

2. Convection
   - Transfer of heat by movement of fluids or gases
   - Natural convection: Driven by buoyancy (hot air rises)
   - Forced convection: Driven by external forces (e.g., wind, fans)
   - Example: Hot air rising in a room

3. Radiation
   - Transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves
   - Does not require a medium
   - Example: Heat from the sun warming surfaces

### Thermal Comfort Factors

1. Air temperature
2. Relative humidity
3. Air velocity
4. Mean radiant temperature
5. Metabolic rate
6. Clothing insulation

### Adaptive Thermal Comfort Model

- People adapt to their thermal environment
- Comfort range varies based on outdoor temperatures and local climate
- Important for passive design in tropical climates like Timor Leste

## Timor Leste's Climate Characteristics

### Geographic Overview

- Located in Southeast Asia, north of Australia
- Area: 14,874 km²
- Terrain: Mountainous with coastal plains

### Temperature Patterns

- Tropical hot and humid climate
- Average annual temperature: 24-32°C
- Minimal seasonal temperature variation

### Humidity Patterns

- High humidity year-round
- Average relative humidity: 70-80%
- Highest in rainy season (December-April)

### Rainfall

- Annual rainfall: 1,500-2,000 mm
- Rainy season: December to April
- Dry season: May to November

### Wind Patterns

- Influenced by monsoons
- Northwest monsoon: December to March
- Southeast monsoon: May to October

### Microclimates

- Coastal areas: Higher temperatures, sea breezes
- Mountain regions: Cooler temperatures, increased rainfall

## Traditional Timorese Architecture and Cooling Strategies

### Building Forms

1. Elevated structures
   - Allows air circulation underneath
   - Protects from ground moisture and animals

2. Steep roof pitches
   - Sheds heavy rainfall quickly
   - Creates space for hot air to rise

3. Open floor plans
   - Facilitates cross-ventilation

### Materials

1. Bamboo
   - Lightweight, allows air movement
   - Natural insulation properties

2. Thatch roofing
   - Provides insulation
   - Allows some air permeability

3. Woven palm leaf walls
   - Permits air movement while providing shade

### Natural Ventilation Techniques

1. Large openings
   - Positioned to capture prevailing winds

2. High ceilings
   - Allows hot air to rise away from occupants

3. Permeable walls
   - Enables constant air exchange

### Shading Strategies

1. Wide roof overhangs
   - Protect walls and openings from sun and rain

2. Raised platforms
   - Create shaded areas underneath for daytime activities

3. Vegetation
   - Traditional use of trees and plants for natural shading

### Thermal Mass

1. Earth floors in some regions
   - Provides cooling effect through direct contact

2. Stone foundations
   - Absorbs heat during day, releases at night

# Discussion Questions

1. How do the principles of heat transfer (conduction, convection, radiation) apply to building design in Timor Leste's climate?

2. In what ways does Timor Leste's climate differ from other tropical regions you're familiar with? How might these differences impact passive cooling strategies?

3. What are the key features of traditional Timorese architecture that contribute to passive cooling? How do these features reflect the local climate?

4. How might the adaptive thermal comfort model be particularly relevant for passive cooling design in Timor Leste?

5. What challenges might arise when trying to incorporate traditional cooling strategies into modern building designs in Timor Leste?

6. How do the different microclimates within Timor Leste (coastal vs. mountainous) affect passive cooling approaches? What strategies might work better in each area?

7. In what ways could traditional Timorese building materials be combined with modern materials to enhance passive cooling performance?

8. How might climate change impact the effectiveness of traditional passive cooling strategies in Timor Leste? What adaptations might be necessary?

9. What cultural or social factors should be considered when designing passive cooling systems for buildings in Timor Leste?

10. How can the lessons from traditional Timorese architecture be applied to larger, public buildings such as schools or government offices?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Passive Cooling Strategy Analysis

1. Choose a specific passive cooling strategy used in traditional Timorese architecture (e.g., elevated structures, steep roofs, permeable walls).

2. Write a 500-word essay analyzing this strategy, addressing the following points:
   - Describe the strategy in detail
   - Explain how it works to cool buildings, referencing heat transfer principles
   - Discuss its effectiveness in Timor Leste's climate
   - Consider potential limitations or challenges of the strategy
   - Suggest how this strategy could be adapted or improved for use in modern buildings

3. Include at least one sketch or diagram to illustrate the strategy.

4. Cite at least two sources to support your analysis (course materials, academic papers, or reputable websites).

5. Conclude with your opinion on the potential for this strategy to be widely adopted in contemporary Timorese architecture.

# Assignment Details

## Climate Data Analysis Project

### Objective
Analyze climate data from different regions of Timor Leste to inform passive cooling design decisions.

### Instructions
1. Form groups of 3-4 students.

2. Each group will be assigned a different region of Timor Leste (e.g., Dili, Baucau, Maliana, Same).

3. Using the provided climate data for your assigned region, create the following graphs:
   - Monthly average high and low temperatures
   - Monthly average relative humidity
   - Monthly rainfall
   - Wind rose diagram (if data available)

4. Analyze your graphs and write a 2-page report addressing:
   - Key climate characteristics of your region
   - Potential passive cooling strategies suitable for this climate
   - Challenges for passive cooling in this region
   - Recommendations for building design based on the climate data

5. Prepare a 10-minute presentation of your findings to share with the class.

### Deliverables
- Set of climate data graphs
- 2-page written report
- Presentation slides

### Due Date
