Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Introduction to Passive Cooling in Timor Leste, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Introduction to Passive Cooling in Timor Leste

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Passive cooling: Techniques to reduce indoor temperatures without mechanical air conditioning
- Heat transfer: Movement of thermal energy from one object or space to another
- Conduction: Heat transfer through direct contact between materials
- Convection: Heat transfer through the movement of fluids or gases
- Radiation: Heat transfer through electromagnetic waves
- Thermal comfort: State of mind expressing satisfaction with the thermal environment
- Microclimate: Local atmospheric conditions that differ from those in surrounding areas
- Vernacular architecture: Building style using local materials and traditions, adapted to climate
- Natural ventilation: The process of supplying and removing air through an indoor space without mechanical systems
- Thermal mass: Materials with the capacity to absorb, store, and release heat

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. Climate map of Timor Leste:
   - Show temperature and humidity variations across different regions
   - Highlight coastal and mountainous areas

2. Heat transfer mechanisms diagram:
   - Illustrate conduction, convection, and radiation in a building context

3. Traditional Timorese house cross-section:
   - Label key passive cooling features (e.g., raised floor, thatched roof, open walls)

4. Thermal comfort zone chart:
   - Graph showing comfort range based on temperature and relative humidity

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. Climate Data Analysis Worksheet:
   - Provide temperature and humidity data for different regions of Timor Leste
   - Include blank graphs for students to plot data
   - Questions to guide analysis of patterns and implications for building design

2. Passive Cooling Strategies Checklist:
   - List of common passive cooling techniques
   - Space for students to note applicability to Timor Leste and examples observed

3. Traditional Building Sketch Template:
   - Outline of a traditional Timorese building
   - Space for students to label and describe passive cooling features

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Books:
   - "Design with Climate: Bioclimatic Approach to Architectural Regionalism" by Victor Olgyay
   - "Sun, Wind, and Light: Architectural Design Strategies" by G.Z. Brown and Mark DeKay

2. Online Resources:
   - BuildingGreen.com - Articles on passive cooling strategies
   - Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG) - Passive Solar Heating and Cooling

3. Local Resources:
   - Timor Leste Meteorological Service - Climate data and reports
   - National Directorate of Housing and Urban Planning - Building guidelines

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may have limited understanding of building physics.
   Tip: Use simple analogies and hands-on demonstrations to explain heat transfer concepts.

2. Challenge: Lack of familiarity with traditional Timorese architecture.
   Tip: Incorporate a field trip or invite a local expert to discuss traditional building techniques.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in analyzing climate data.
   Tip: Provide step-by-step guidance and use visual aids to help students interpret data patterns.

4. Challenge: Connecting passive cooling principles to practical applications.
   Tip: Use case studies of successful passive cooling implementations in similar climates.

5. Challenge: Varying levels of English proficiency among students.
   Tip: Provide key terms in both English and Tetum, and use visual aids to support explanations.

6. Challenge: Limited access to technology for climate data analysis.
   Tip: Prepare printed data sets and graph paper as alternatives to computer-based analysis.
