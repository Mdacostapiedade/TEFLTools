# Lesson Plan: Natural Ventilation Strategies

## 1. Resources Needed

- Classroom with whiteboard and projector
- Handouts with diagrams of wind-driven and buoyancy-driven ventilation
- Cardboard, scissors, and tape for model building
- Smoke pencils or incense for airflow visualization
- Laptop with ventilation simulation software (e.g. DesignBuilder)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the principles of wind-driven and buoyancy-driven ventilation
- Describe the concepts of cross-ventilation and stack effect
- Design and size openings for effective natural ventilation
- Use basic simulation tools to analyze ventilation patterns

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Students form pairs and discuss:
1. How do you stay cool in your home without air conditioning?
2. What traditional Timorese building features help with cooling?
3. How does air movement affect your thermal comfort?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Wind-driven ventilation
- Buoyancy-driven ventilation
- Cross-ventilation
- Stack effect
- Pressure differential
- Air changes per hour (ACH)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Wind-driven Ventilation
- Principles of wind pressure on buildings
- Creating pressure differentials for airflow
- Factors affecting wind-driven ventilation (building orientation, surrounding obstacles)

### Buoyancy-driven Ventilation
- Thermal buoyancy and the stack effect
- Temperature and height differences in driving airflow
- Combining wind and buoyancy effects

### Cross-ventilation Strategies
- Optimal placement of inlet and outlet openings
- Sizing openings for effective airflow
- Using wing walls and other architectural features to enhance cross-ventilation

### Stack Ventilation Strategies
- Designing for vertical air movement
- Atrium and chimney designs for stack ventilation
- Combining stack ventilation with other strategies

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### Activity 1: Cross-ventilation Design (20 minutes)
Students work in pairs to sketch a floor plan for a small Timorese home, incorporating effective cross-ventilation. They must consider:
- Prevailing wind direction
- Size and placement of openings
- Interior layout for unobstructed airflow

### Activity 2: Stack Effect Demonstration (20 minutes)
In small groups, students build simple cardboard models to demonstrate the stack effect:
1. Create a tall box with openings at top and bottom
2. Use smoke pencils to visualize airflow
3. Experiment with different opening sizes and configurations

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

Using ventilation simulation software, students analyze the natural ventilation performance of their cross-ventilation design from Activity 1. They should:
1. Input their design into the software
2. Run a basic ventilation simulation
3. Analyze the results and identify areas for improvement
4. Make design modifications and re-run the simulation

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key principles of natural ventilation
- Discuss challenges and opportunities for natural ventilation in Timor Leste
- Address any remaining questions from students

## 9. Homework Assignment

Design a naturally ventilated community center for a Timorese village:
1. Create a basic floor plan and section showing ventilation strategies
2. Calculate required opening sizes based on desired air change rates
3. Write a brief explanation (300-500 words) of your ventilation design choices
4. Prepare to present your design to the class in the next session

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Wind-driven ventilation: Airflow caused by wind pressure differences on a building's exterior
- Buoyancy-driven ventilation: Airflow caused by temperature and density differences in air
- Cross-ventilation: Airflow from one side of a building to another through openings on opposite or adjacent walls
- Stack effect: Vertical air movement in buildings due to temperature differences between indoor and outdoor air
- Pressure differential: The difference in air pressure between two points that drives airflow
- Air changes per hour (ACH): A measure of how many times the air volume in a space is replaced in one hour
