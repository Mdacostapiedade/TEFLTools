# Lecture Notes

## Wind-driven Ventilation

### Principles of Wind Pressure on Buildings
- Wind creates positive pressure on windward side and negative pressure on leeward side
- Pressure difference drives airflow through openings
- Bernoulli's principle: faster moving air has lower pressure

### Creating Pressure Differentials for Airflow
- Strategic placement of openings to maximize pressure difference
- Use of architectural features like wing walls to enhance pressure differentials
- Importance of unobstructed flow paths through the building

### Factors Affecting Wind-driven Ventilation
- Building orientation relative to prevailing winds
- Surrounding topography and vegetation
- Nearby buildings and structures
- Shape and form of the building itself

## Buoyancy-driven Ventilation

### Thermal Buoyancy and the Stack Effect
- Warm air rises due to lower density
- Cool air enters at lower levels, displacing warm air upwards
- Height difference between inlet and outlet affects strength of stack effect

### Temperature and Height Differences in Driving Airflow
- Greater temperature difference between inside and outside increases effect
- Taller spaces create stronger stack effect
- Calculation: ΔP = 0.04 × h × (Ti - To), where h is height, Ti is indoor temp, To is outdoor temp

### Combining Wind and Buoyancy Effects
- Wind and buoyancy can work together or oppose each other
- Design for both effects to ensure ventilation in various conditions
- Use of wind towers or solar chimneys to enhance combined effects

## Cross-ventilation Strategies

### Optimal Placement of Inlet and Outlet Openings
- Inlets on windward side, outlets on leeward side
- Staggered openings for better air distribution
- Consider prevailing wind directions for different seasons

### Sizing Openings for Effective Airflow
- Rule of thumb: outlet area should be 25% larger than inlet area
- Total opening area typically 5-10% of floor area
- Adjustable openings allow for control in varying conditions

### Using Architectural Features to Enhance Cross-ventilation
- Wing walls to direct airflow
- Louvered openings for airflow control
- Transom windows for nighttime ventilation

## Stack Ventilation Strategies

### Designing for Vertical Air Movement
- Central atrium or stairwell as stack
- Operable skylights or clerestory windows at top of stack
- Low-level inlets for cool air entry

### Atrium and Chimney Designs for Stack Ventilation
- Solar chimneys: use solar gain to enhance stack effect
- Double-skin facades with ventilated cavity
- Atrium design considerations: height, shape, and opening locations

### Combining Stack Ventilation with Other Strategies
- Integration with cross-ventilation for enhanced performance
- Use of thermal mass with night ventilation
- Hybrid systems with low-energy mechanical assistance when needed

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: The Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Center, New Caledonia

Designed by Renzo Piano, this building exemplifies the integration of traditional ventilation techniques with modern design. Key features:

- Inspired by traditional Kanak huts
- Curved wooden structures act as wind scoops
- Double-skin design allows for passive ventilation
- Computerized sensors adjust louvers for optimal airflow

Analyze how similar principles could be applied in Timor Leste, considering:
- Local architectural traditions
- Available materials
- Climate differences between New Caledonia and Timor Leste

## Ventilation Calculation Formulas

1. Air Changes per Hour (ACH):
   ACH = (Airflow rate in m³/h) / (Room volume in m³)

2. Required ventilation rate:
   Q = N × Vp
   Where:
   Q = Ventilation rate (m³/s)
   N = Number of occupants
   Vp = Ventilation rate per person (m³/s/person)

3. Opening size for wind-driven ventilation:
   A = Q / (Cv × v)
   Where:
   A = Opening area (m²)
   Q = Required airflow rate (m³/s)
   Cv = Effectiveness of opening (typically 0.5-0.6)
   v = Wind velocity (m/s)

Use these formulas in your assignments to justify opening sizes and ventilation rates.
