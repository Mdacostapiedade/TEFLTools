# Support Material for Natural Ventilation Strategies Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Wind-driven ventilation**: Airflow caused by wind pressure differences on a building's exterior
- **Buoyancy-driven ventilation**: Airflow caused by temperature and density differences in air
- **Cross-ventilation**: Airflow from one side of a building to another through openings on opposite or adjacent walls
- **Stack effect**: Vertical air movement in buildings due to temperature differences between indoor and outdoor air
- **Pressure differential**: The difference in air pressure between two points that drives airflow
- **Air changes per hour (ACH)**: A measure of how many times the air volume in a space is replaced in one hour
- **Prevailing winds**: The most common wind direction in a given location
- **Wing wall**: A vertical projection on the exterior of a building used to enhance natural ventilation
- **Thermal comfort**: The perception of satisfaction with the thermal environment
- **Venturi effect**: The reduction in fluid pressure that results when a fluid flows through a constricted section of pipe

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Wind-driven ventilation diagram**: 
   - Show a building floor plan with arrows indicating wind direction
   - Highlight pressure differences on windward and leeward sides
   - Illustrate airflow patterns through the building

2. **Buoyancy-driven ventilation diagram**:
   - Depict a building section with temperature gradients
   - Show arrows indicating warm air rising and cool air entering at lower levels
   - Label key elements like stack height and temperature differences

3. **Cross-ventilation strategies illustration**:
   - Present multiple floor plan configurations showing optimal window placements
   - Include examples of good and poor cross-ventilation designs

4. **Stack ventilation diagram**:
   - Show a building section with a central atrium or chimney
   - Illustrate airflow patterns from lower to upper levels
   - Label key design elements like inlet and outlet sizes

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Cross-ventilation design worksheet**:
   - Provide a blank floor plan grid
   - Include a wind rose diagram for a typical Timorese location
   - List design considerations (e.g., prevailing winds, room layout, opening sizes)
   - Space for students to sketch their design and explain rationale

2. **Stack effect calculation worksheet**:
   - Provide formulas for calculating stack effect pressure
   - Include a step-by-step guide for determining required opening sizes
   - Offer practice problems with varying building heights and temperature differences

3. **Ventilation simulation analysis guide**:
   - Step-by-step instructions for using the chosen simulation software
   - Checklist of key parameters to input (e.g., building geometry, wind data, opening sizes)
   - Guide for interpreting simulation results and identifying areas for improvement

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

4. Case studies:
   - Collection of naturally ventilated buildings in tropical climates
   - Post-occupancy evaluations of passive cooling projects in Southeast Asia

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to visualize 3D airflow patterns
   - **Solution**: Use physical models or 3D animations to demonstrate airflow. Consider using smoke tests or wind tunnels for visual demonstrations.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in applying concepts to local Timorese context
   - **Solution**: Provide specific examples of traditional and modern Timorese buildings using natural ventilation. Invite local architects or builders as guest speakers.

3. **Challenge**: Students overwhelmed by technical calculations
   - **Solution**: Start with simplified rules of thumb before introducing complex formulas. Provide step-by-step guides and plenty of practice problems.

4. **Challenge**: Limited access to advanced simulation software
   - **Solution**: Focus on basic principles and manual calculations. Use free online tools or simplified simulation apps where possible.

5. **Challenge**: Integrating natural ventilation with other design considerations
   - **Solution**: Emphasize the holistic design approach. Use case studies that showcase successful integration of ventilation with other architectural elements.

6. **Challenge**: Addressing humidity concerns in Timor Leste's climate
   - **Solution**: Discuss strategies for managing humidity alongside temperature control. Explore dehumidification techniques that complement natural ventilation.
