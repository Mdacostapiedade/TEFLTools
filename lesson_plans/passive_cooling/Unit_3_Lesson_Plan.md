## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Evaporative cooling: The process of reducing air temperature by evaporating water into it
- Wet-bulb temperature: The lowest temperature that can be reached by evaporating water into air at constant pressure
- Direct evaporative cooling: A method where water evaporates directly into the air stream being cooled
- Indirect evaporative cooling: A process where the primary air stream is cooled without adding moisture, typically through a heat exchanger
- Cooling tower: A heat rejection device that extracts waste heat to the atmosphere through the cooling of water by evaporation
- Roof spray system: A method of cooling buildings by spraying water on the roof surface to promote evaporation
