## Principles of Evaporative Cooling

### Physics of Evaporation and Heat Transfer
- Evaporation is the process of liquid water changing to water vapor
- Evaporation requires energy, which is absorbed from the surrounding air
- This energy absorption results in a cooling effect
- The rate of evaporation depends on:
  * Air temperature
  * Relative humidity
  * Air movement
  * Surface area of water exposed to air

### Wet-Bulb Temperature and Its Significance
- Wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that can be achieved by evaporative cooling
- It's measured by a thermometer covered with a wet cloth exposed to airflow
- The difference between dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures indicates the potential for evaporative cooling
- In arid climates, the wet-bulb depression (difference) is larger, allowing for more effective cooling

## Direct Evaporative Cooling

### Process and Effectiveness
- Water is directly evaporated into the air stream being cooled
- Air passes through a wet medium (e.g., pads, mist)
- Temperature decreases while humidity increases
- Effectiveness typically ranges from 70-95%
- Cooling potential limited by wet-bulb temperature

### Applications and Limitations
- Suitable for dry climates
- Commonly used in:
  * Residential coolers (swamp coolers)
  * Industrial spaces
  * Greenhouses
- Limitations:
  * Adds moisture to air (may be undesirable in humid climates)
  * Requires regular maintenance of wet media
  * Water consumption can be significant

## Indirect Evaporative Cooling

### How it Differs from Direct Cooling
- Uses a heat exchanger to separate cooled air from the evaporation process
- Primary air stream is cooled without adding moisture
- Secondary air stream undergoes evaporative cooling and is then exhausted

### Advantages and Disadvantages
- Advantages:
  * No moisture added to cooled air
  * Can be used in more humid climates
  * Can achieve lower temperatures than direct evaporative cooling
- Disadvantages:
  * More complex system
  * Higher initial cost
  * Slightly lower efficiency compared to direct cooling

## Evaporative Cooling Devices

### Cooling Towers
- Used primarily in industrial applications and large HVAC systems
- Water is cooled by evaporation as it falls through a tower
- Cooled water is then used to remove heat from a separate system

### Roof Spray Systems
- Water is sprayed directly onto the roof surface
- Evaporation cools the roof, reducing heat gain to the building
- Can be integrated with rainwater harvesting systems

### Evaporative Coolers (Swamp Coolers)
- Residential or small commercial units
- Use a fan to draw air through wet pads
- Cooled, humidified air is distributed throughout the space

## Water Resources in Timor Leste

### Availability and Seasonal Variations
- Timor Leste has a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons
- Annual rainfall varies significantly by region (1,500-2,000 mm on average)
- Dry season (May to November) poses challenges for water-dependent cooling systems

### Water Quality Considerations
- Surface water often contaminated with sediment and pollutants
- Groundwater quality varies, with some areas affected by saltwater intrusion
- Water treatment may be necessary for evaporative cooling systems to prevent scaling and biological growth

### Conservation Strategies
- Rainwater harvesting during wet season
- Greywater recycling for cooling systems
- Efficient system design to minimize water consumption
- Regular maintenance to prevent leaks and optimize performance
