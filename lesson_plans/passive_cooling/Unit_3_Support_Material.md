# Support Material for Evaporative Cooling Technologies Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Evaporative cooling**: The process of reducing air temperature by evaporating water into it
- **Wet-bulb temperature**: The lowest temperature that can be reached by evaporating water into air at constant pressure
- **Direct evaporative cooling**: A method where water evaporates directly into the air stream being cooled
- **Indirect evaporative cooling**: A process where the primary air stream is cooled without adding moisture, typically through a heat exchanger
- **Cooling tower**: A heat rejection device that extracts waste heat to the atmosphere through the cooling of water by evaporation
- **Roof spray system**: A method of cooling buildings by spraying water on the roof surface to promote evaporation
- **Swamp cooler**: Another term for a simple evaporative cooler, commonly used in dry climates
- **Wet-bulb depression**: The difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, indicating the potential for evaporative cooling
- **Adiabatic cooling**: A process where air is cooled by expansion without heat exchange with the surroundings
- **Psychrometric chart**: A graphical representation of the thermodynamic properties of moist air
