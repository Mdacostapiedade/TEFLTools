# Lesson Plan: Building Envelope Design for Passive Cooling

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Samples of local building materials
- Solar path diagrams for Timor Leste
- Thermal imaging camera (if available)
- Cardboard, scissors, and glue for shading device models
- Handouts on thermal properties of materials

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the principles of solar geometry and its impact on building design
- Design effective shading devices for different building orientations
- Describe the role of thermal mass in passive cooling
- Select appropriate local materials for passive cooling strategies
- Apply cool roof and wall techniques to reduce heat gain

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Students form small groups and brainstorm all the ways they can think of to keep a building cool without using air conditioning. Groups share their ideas with the class, and the instructor categorizes them on the board (e.g., shading, ventilation, materials, etc.).

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Solar azimuth and altitude
- Thermal mass
- Heat capacity
- Albedo
- Emissivity
- Cool roof

Use visual aids and simple examples to illustrate these concepts.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### 5.1 Solar Geometry and Shading Devices
- Explain solar path diagrams for Timor Leste
- Discuss different types of shading devices (overhangs, louvers, screens)
- Show examples of effective shading in traditional and modern Timorese buildings

### 5.2 Thermal Mass and Night Cooling
- Explain the concept of thermal mass and its role in passive cooling
- Discuss strategies for night cooling and ventilation
- Present case studies of buildings using thermal mass effectively

### 5.3 Cool Roofs and Walls
- Introduce the concepts of albedo and emissivity
- Explain cool roof technologies and materials
- Discuss cool wall strategies and their applicability in Timor Leste

### 5.4 Local and Sustainable Building Materials
- Present an overview of traditional and modern building materials available in Timor Leste
- Discuss the thermal properties of these materials
- Explain how to select materials for passive cooling based on their properties

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### 6.1 Shading Device Design Exercise
Students work in pairs to design a shading device for a south-facing window in Dili, using cardboard and other materials. They must explain how their design responds to the local solar geometry.

### 6.2 Material Selection Activity
Provide students with a list of local building materials and their thermal properties. Have them select appropriate materials for walls, roofs, and floors for a passively cooled building, justifying their choices.

## 7. Production Task (20 minutes)

Students individually sketch a conceptual design for a small passively cooled building (e.g., a community center) in Timor Leste, incorporating at least three strategies learned in the lesson. They should annotate their sketches to explain their design decisions.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Have students share one new thing they learned and one question they still have
- Preview the next lesson on earth cooling techniques

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will research a traditional Timorese building technique and analyze how it contributes to passive cooling. They should prepare a short presentation (3-5 minutes) for the next class, including photos or sketches and an explanation of the cooling principles involved.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Solar azimuth: The horizontal angle of the sun's position relative to true north
- Solar altitude: The vertical angle of the sun above the horizon
- Thermal mass: The ability of a material to absorb and store heat energy
- Heat capacity: The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a material by one degree
- Albedo: The proportion of solar radiation reflected by a surface
- Emissivity: The ability of a material to emit thermal radiation
- Cool roof: A roofing system that reflects more solar radiation and emits more heat than standard roofs
