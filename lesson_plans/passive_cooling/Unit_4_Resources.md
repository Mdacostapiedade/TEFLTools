## Solar Geometry and Shading Devices

### Solar Path in Timor Leste
- Timor Leste's latitude: approximately 8.5°S
- Sun path varies throughout the year
- Summer solstice (December 21): Sun reaches highest altitude
- Winter solstice (June 21): Sun reaches lowest altitude
- Equinoxes (March 20 and September 22): Sun directly overhead at noon

### Types of Shading Devices
1. Horizontal overhangs
   - Effective for north and south-facing facades
   - Depth calculation: D = H / tan(90° - latitude - 23.5°)
   - Where D is depth, H is window height

2. Vertical fins
   - Effective for east and west-facing facades
   - Can be fixed or adjustable

3. Egg-crate shading
   - Combination of horizontal and vertical elements
   - Provides comprehensive shading

4. Louvres
   - Adjustable slats allow for variable shading
   - Can be horizontal or vertical

### Shading Design Considerations
- Building orientation
- Window size and placement
- Local climate conditions
- Seasonal variations in sun angle
- Integration with building aesthetics

## Thermal Mass and Night Cooling

### Principles of Thermal Mass
- Definition: ability of a material to absorb and store heat
- High thermal mass materials: concrete, brick, stone, water
- Low thermal mass materials: wood, insulation

### How Thermal Mass Works
1. Heat absorption during day
2. Heat release during night
3. Time lag between external and internal temperature peaks

### Night Cooling Strategies
1. Natural ventilation
   - Cross ventilation
   - Stack effect
2. Mechanical ventilation
   - Fans to circulate cool night air
3. Thermal mass exposure
   - Ensure thermal mass is exposed to night air

### Designing with Thermal Mass
- Place thermal mass inside the insulated building envelope
- Expose thermal mass to direct sunlight in winter (if heating is needed)
- Use light-colored surfaces to reflect sunlight onto thermal mass
- Combine with proper ventilation strategies

## Cool Roofs and Walls

### Cool Roof Principles
- High solar reflectance (albedo)
- High thermal emittance

### Cool Roof Materials
1. White or light-colored metal roofing
2. White membrane roofing
3. Cool-colored tiles or shingles
4. Green roofs

### Cool Wall Strategies
1. Light-colored exterior paints
2. Reflective coatings
3. Green walls or vertical gardens

### Benefits of Cool Roofs and Walls
- Reduced heat gain
- Lower cooling energy costs
- Mitigate urban heat island effect
- Extend roof lifespan

## Local and Sustainable Building Materials in Timor Leste

### Traditional Materials
1. Bamboo
   - High strength-to-weight ratio
   - Rapid growth and renewability
   - Natural cooling properties

2. Palm leaves (for thatching)
   - Excellent insulation properties
   - Locally available and renewable

3. Earth (adobe, rammed earth)
   - High thermal mass
   - Low embodied energy

### Modern Sustainable Materials
1. Compressed earth blocks
   - Improved durability over traditional adobe
   - Low environmental impact

2. Recycled materials
   - Repurposed shipping containers
   - Recycled plastic lumber

3. Locally-sourced timber
   - Sustainable if properly managed
   - Good insulation properties

### Material Selection Criteria for Passive Cooling
- Thermal conductivity
- Heat capacity
- Density
- Embodied energy
- Local availability
- Durability in tropical climate

# Discussion Questions

1. How can traditional Timorese building techniques be adapted to modern construction while maintaining their passive cooling benefits?

2. What are the challenges and opportunities in implementing cool roof technologies in Timor Leste's climate and economic context?

3. How might climate change impact the effectiveness of current passive cooling strategies in Timor Leste, and how can designs be adapted to address this?

4. Discuss the trade-offs between using high thermal mass materials and the need for natural ventilation in Timor Leste's climate.

5. How can shading devices be designed to balance the need for cooling with other considerations such as daylighting and views?

6. What are the potential barriers to adopting sustainable, local materials in modern construction in Timor Leste, and how might these be overcome?

7. Compare and contrast the effectiveness of cool roofs versus cool walls in the context of Timor Leste's climate. Which might be more appropriate and why?

8. How can passive cooling strategies be effectively combined with active systems to create hybrid solutions suitable for different building types in Timor Leste?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Propose a passive cooling strategy for a new community center in a rural village in Timor Leste. Describe the specific techniques you would use, the materials you would select, and explain how your design responds to the local climate and cultural context. Include a simple sketch of your design concept."

Your essay should include:
- An introduction outlining the climate challenges in rural Timor Leste
- At least three specific passive cooling strategies discussed in class
- Justification for material choices based on local availability and thermal properties
- Consideration of cultural appropriateness and community needs
- A conclusion summarizing the expected benefits of your design
