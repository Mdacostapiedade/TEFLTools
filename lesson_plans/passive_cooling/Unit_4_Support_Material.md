Here's the support material for the lesson on Building Envelope Design for Passive Cooling, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Building Envelope Design for Passive Cooling

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Solar azimuth: The horizontal angle of the sun's position relative to true north
- Solar altitude: The vertical angle of the sun above the horizon
- Thermal mass: The ability of a material to absorb and store heat energy
- Heat capacity: The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a material by one degree
- Albedo: The proportion of solar radiation reflected by a surface
- Emissivity: The ability of a material to emit thermal radiation
- Cool roof: A roofing system that reflects more solar radiation and emits more heat than standard roofs
- Shading device: An architectural element designed to block direct sunlight from entering a building
- Passive cooling: Techniques to cool buildings without the use of mechanical systems
- Building envelope: The physical separator between the interior and exterior of a building

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Solar Path Diagram:
   A circular diagram showing the sun's path across the sky at different times of the year for Timor Leste's latitude. Include lines for summer and winter solstices, and equinoxes.

2. Shading Device Types:
   Illustrations of different shading devices:
   - Horizontal overhang
   - Vertical fins
   - Egg-crate shading
   - Adjustable louvers

3. Thermal Mass Diagram:
   A simple illustration showing how thermal mass absorbs heat during the day and releases it at night, with arrows indicating heat flow.

4. Cool Roof Comparison:
   Side-by-side diagrams of a standard roof and a cool roof, showing how each interacts with solar radiation (reflection, absorption, and emission).

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Material Properties Worksheet:
   A table listing common building materials in Timor Leste with columns for:
   - Material name
   - Thermal conductivity
   - Heat capacity
   - Albedo
   - Emissivity
   Students fill in the values and use this information for the material selection activity.

2. Shading Device Design Checklist:
   A list of considerations for designing effective shading devices:
   - Building orientation
   - Window size and position
   - Seasonal sun angles
   - Material durability
   - Maintenance requirements
   - Visual comfort (glare reduction)
   - Integration with building aesthetics

3. Passive Cooling Strategies Summary:
   A one-page summary of key passive cooling strategies covered in the lesson, including brief descriptions and simple illustrations for each.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Books:
   - "Sun, Wind & Light: Architectural Design Strategies" by G.Z. Brown and Mark DeKay
   - "The Solar House: Passive Heating and Cooling" by Daniel D. Chiras

2. Online Resources:
   - BuildingGreen.com articles on passive cooling strategies
   - Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG) - Passive Solar Heating

3. Software Tools:
   - Climate Consultant: For analyzing local climate data and generating design strategies
   - Ecotect Analysis: For solar studies and shading design (now part of Autodesk Revit)

4. Local Resources:
   - Timor Leste National Building Code (if available)
   - Local meteorological data sources for detailed climate information

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with solar geometry concepts
   Tip: Use physical models or online simulations to demonstrate sun paths and shading. Consider bringing students outside to observe real-time sun positions and shadows.

2. Challenge: Limited availability of high-tech materials in Timor Leste
   Tip: Focus on locally available and traditional materials. Encourage students to innovate with readily accessible resources.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in visualizing thermal concepts
   Tip: Use analogies (e.g., thermal mass as a "heat sponge") and simple experiments (e.g., comparing how different materials heat up and cool down) to make concepts more tangible.

4. Challenge: Balancing passive cooling with other design requirements
   Tip: Discuss real-world trade-offs and use case studies to show how designers have integrated passive cooling with other building functions and aesthetics.

5. Challenge: Applying concepts to Timor Leste's specific climate
   Tip: Consistently relate general principles to local conditions. Use local weather data and traditional building examples to ground the learning in familiar contexts.
