# Lesson Plan: Earth Cooling Techniques

## 1. Resources Needed

- Classroom with projector and internet access
- Soil temperature probe
- Local soil maps and geological data for Timor Leste
- Samples of different soil types
- Cardboard and basic craft materials for model building
- Computer lab with energy simulation software

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the principles of earth cooling and its potential in Timor Leste
- Analyze ground temperature patterns and their impact on building cooling
- Describe different earth cooling techniques including earth berming and earth-air heat exchangers
- Design a basic earth-air heat exchanger system for a small building

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Ask students to share their experiences with cool spaces they've encountered underground or partially buried (e.g., cellars, caves). Discuss why these spaces feel cooler and how this relates to building design.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Earth berming
- Earth-air heat exchanger
- Geothermal gradient
- Thermal mass
- Soil thermal conductivity

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Ground Temperature Patterns in Timor Leste
- Explain the concept of ground temperature stability
- Present local data on soil temperatures at various depths
- Discuss factors affecting ground temperature (soil type, moisture content, etc.)

### Earth Berming and Underground Structures
- Introduce the concept of earth berming
- Discuss advantages and challenges of underground buildings
- Present examples of earth-sheltered buildings from similar climates

### Earth-Air Heat Exchangers (Earth Tubes)
- Explain the principle of earth-air heat exchangers
- Discuss design considerations (tube material, length, depth, air flow rate)
- Present case studies of successful implementations

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Activity 1: Soil Temperature Analysis
Students use soil temperature probes to measure temperatures at different depths in the school grounds. They plot the results and discuss the implications for earth cooling.

### Activity 2: Earth Cooling Potential Mapping
In small groups, students analyze local soil maps and climate data to identify areas with high potential for earth cooling techniques in Timor Leste.

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

### Conceptual Design of an Earth-Cooled Building
Students work in pairs to create a conceptual design for a small earth-cooled building (e.g., a community center) using either earth berming or an earth-air heat exchanger. They should consider local climate, soil conditions, and cultural factors in their design.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap the main principles of earth cooling
- Discuss the potential and challenges of implementing these techniques in Timor Leste
- Address any questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will:
1. Research and write a 500-word report on a traditional or modern building in a tropical climate that uses earth cooling techniques.
2. Begin a site analysis for the earth-cooled building project, including soil investigation and climate data collection.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Earth berming: The use of earth piled up against exterior walls to reduce heat gain and stabilize interior temperatures.
- Earth-air heat exchanger: A system of underground pipes through which air is circulated to be cooled by the relatively stable ground temperature.
- Geothermal gradient: The rate at which temperature increases with depth in the Earth's crust.
- Thermal mass: The ability of a material to absorb and store heat energy.
- Soil thermal conductivity: The rate at which heat passes through a specified material, expressed as the amount of heat that flows per unit time through a unit area with a temperature gradient of one degree per unit distance.
