## Ground Temperature Patterns in Timor Leste

### Introduction to Ground Temperature Stability
- Earth's surface temperatures fluctuate daily and seasonally
- Below a certain depth, ground temperature remains relatively constant
- This depth varies depending on location and soil properties

### Factors Affecting Ground Temperature
1. Soil type
   - Thermal conductivity varies by soil composition
   - Sandy soils conduct heat faster than clay soils
2. Moisture content
   - Water increases soil thermal conductivity
   - Affects heat storage capacity
3. Vegetation cover
   - Shading reduces surface heating
   - Transpiration cools surrounding soil
4. Surface albedo
   - Lighter surfaces reflect more solar radiation
   - Darker surfaces absorb more heat

### Timor Leste's Ground Temperature Profile
- Average annual surface temperature: 25-28°C
- Temperature stabilization depth: approximately 3-5 meters
- Stable ground temperature range: 22-24°C (varies by location)

### Implications for Building Design
- Potential for passive cooling using earth contact
- Opportunity for pre-cooling ventilation air
- Seasonal thermal energy storage possibilities

## Earth Berming and Underground Structures

### Principles of Earth Berming
- Definition: Using earth against building walls for insulation
- Benefits:
  1. Reduced heat gain/loss
  2. Temperature stabilization
  3. Wind protection
  4. Noise reduction
  5. Landscape integration

### Types of Earth-Sheltered Buildings
1. Elevational: One or more walls earth-covered
2. Penetrational: Rooms extend into hillside
3. Atrium: Central open courtyard with surrounding earth-sheltered spaces
4. Subterranean: Fully underground structure

### Design Considerations for Earth-Sheltered Buildings
- Structural requirements to withstand earth pressure
- Waterproofing and moisture control
- Daylighting strategies
- Ventilation and air quality management
- Psychological aspects of underground spaces
- Local building codes and regulations

### Case Studies

## Earth-Air Heat Exchangers (Earth Tubes)

### Operating Principle
- Air circulated through underground pipes
- Heat exchange with stable ground temperature
- Pre-cooling in summer, pre-heating in winter

### System Components
1. Intake
2. Underground pipes
3. Condensate drainage
4. Fan or natural draft
5. Filtration system
6. Distribution within building

### Design Parameters

- Pipe diameter (typically 10-30 cm)
- Pipe length (30-100 meters)
- Burial depth (1.5-3 meters)
- Air flow rate
- Soil thermal properties

### Performance Factors
- Temperature difference between ambient air and ground
- Air velocity in pipes
- Surface area of pipes
- Thermal conductivity of soil and pipe material
- System runtime

### Maintenance Considerations

# Additional Materials

## Soil Thermal Properties of Common Timor Leste Soil Types

| Soil Type | Thermal Conductivity (W/m·K) | Heat Capacity (J/kg·K) | Density (kg/m³) |
|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Sandy Loam | 0.9 - 1.4 | 800 - 1200 | 1300 - 1600 |
| Clay Loam | 0.8 - 1.2 | 1000 - 1400 | 1400 - 1700 |
| Limestone | 1.5 - 3.0 | 800 - 900 | 2000 - 2400 |

## Example Earth Tube Sizing Calculation

For a 100 m² building in Dili, Timor Leste:

1. Assume cooling load: 80 W/m²
2. Total cooling load: 100 m² × 80 W/m² = 8000 W
3. Earth tube diameter: 200 mm
4. Air velocity: 2 m/s
5. Air flow rate: π × (0.1 m)² × 2 m/s = 0.0628 m³/s
6. Temperature difference (inlet - ground): 8°C
7. Air density: 1.2 kg/m³
8. Specific heat capacity of air: 1005 J/kg·K

Cooling capacity = 0.0628 m³/s × 1.2 kg/m³ × 1005 J/kg·K × 8°C = 607 W

Required tube length = 8000 W / (607 W / 30 m) ≈ 395 m

This length can be divided into multiple parallel tubes.

## Earth Berming Thermal Performance Example

Assuming a wall U-value of 0.5 W/m²·K without earth berming:

1. Earth berm height: 2 m
2. Wall height: 3 m
3. Average soil thermal conductivity: 1.0 W/m·K
4. Soil thickness: 1 m

New U-value for bermed portion:
U = 1 / (1/0.5 + 1/1.0) = 0.33 W/m²·K

Overall wall U-value:
U_avg = (2m × 0.33 + 1m × 0.5) / 3m = 0.39 W/m²·K

This represents a 22% improvement in thermal performance.
