# Support Material for Earth Cooling Techniques Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Earth berming: The use of earth piled up against exterior walls to reduce heat gain and stabilize interior temperatures.
- Earth-air heat exchanger: A system of underground pipes through which air is circulated to be cooled by the relatively stable ground temperature.
- Geothermal gradient: The rate at which temperature increases with depth in the Earth's crust.
- Thermal mass: The ability of a material to absorb and store heat energy.
- Soil thermal conductivity: The rate at which heat passes through a specified material, expressed as the amount of heat that flows per unit time through a unit area with a temperature gradient of one degree per unit distance.
- Earth tube: Another term for an earth-air heat exchanger.
- Passive cooling: Cooling strategies that do not require mechanical systems or energy input.
- Ground temperature stability: The phenomenon where soil temperature remains relatively constant at certain depths throughout the year.
- Soil moisture content: The amount of water present in soil, which affects its thermal properties.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. Ground Temperature Profile Diagram:
   - A vertical cross-section of soil layers
   - Temperature scale on the side
   - Lines showing temperature variation at different depths throughout the year
   - Highlight the depth where temperature remains stable

2. Earth Berming Illustration:
   - Cross-section of a building with earth piled against its walls
   - Arrows showing heat flow and temperature differences
   - Labels for key components (thermal mass, insulation, ventilation)

3. Earth-Air Heat Exchanger Schematic:
   - Top view and side view of a building with underground pipes
   - Arrows showing air flow through the system
   - Labels for intake, underground pipes, and outlet into the building
   - Temperature indicators at various points in the system

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. Soil Temperature Data Collection Sheet:
   - Table with columns for depth, time, date, and temperature
   - Space for students to plot a simple graph of depth vs. temperature
   - Questions prompting analysis of the data

2. Earth Cooling Potential Mapping Worksheet:
   - Simplified map of a region in Timor Leste
   - Legend with soil types, elevation, and other relevant factors
   - Instructions for students to color-code areas based on earth cooling potential
   - Questions guiding students through the analysis process

3. Earth-Cooled Building Design Checklist:
   - List of factors to consider (climate, soil type, building use, cultural factors)
   - Space for sketches and notes
   - Prompts for key design decisions (e.g., earth berming vs. earth tubes)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggle to understand ground temperature stability.
   Solution: Use a simple experiment with buried temperature sensors over time or provide long-term data from local sources.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in visualizing earth-air heat exchanger systems.
   Solution: Use physical models or 3D animations to demonstrate air flow and cooling process.

3. Challenge: Limited local data on soil properties in Timor Leste.
   Solution: Partner with local universities or geological surveys to obtain data, or use general soil type information as a starting point.

4. Challenge: Students may be unfamiliar with energy simulation software.
   Solution: Provide a basic tutorial or use simplified online calculators as an introduction before moving to more complex tools.

5. Challenge: Integrating cultural considerations into earth-cooled designs.
   Solution: Invite local architects or community leaders to discuss traditional building practices and cultural preferences.
