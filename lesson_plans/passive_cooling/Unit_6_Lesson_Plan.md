# Lesson Plan: Integration of Passive and Mechanical Systems

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with energy modeling software (e.g. EnergyPlus, DesignBuilder)
- Projector and screen
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on hybrid cooling system components
- Case studies of mixed-mode cooled buildings in tropical climates
- Local climate data for Timor Leste

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the concept of hybrid cooling systems
- Identify key components of mixed-mode cooling strategies
- Analyze the performance of integrated passive and mechanical cooling systems
- Design a basic mixed-mode cooling system for a public building in Timor Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Think-Pair-Share: Students reflect on the advantages and disadvantages of purely passive vs. purely mechanical cooling systems they've learned about in previous units. They share their thoughts with a partner, then discuss as a class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Hybrid cooling
- Mixed-mode ventilation
- Adaptive comfort
- Switchover temperature
- Building management system (BMS)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Introduction to hybrid cooling systems
  - Definition and rationale
  - Types of hybrid systems (concurrent, changeover, zoned)
- Components of mixed-mode cooling strategies
  - Passive elements (natural ventilation, thermal mass, etc.)
  - Mechanical elements (fans, chillers, etc.)
  - Control systems and sensors
- Performance optimization in hybrid systems
  - Energy efficiency considerations
  - Thermal comfort standards
  - Adaptive comfort models

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Case Study Analysis (20 minutes):
   In small groups, students analyze provided case studies of mixed-mode cooled buildings in tropical climates. They identify the passive and mechanical strategies used and discuss how they are integrated.

2. Control Strategy Simulation (20 minutes):
   Using a simple energy modeling tool, students experiment with different control strategies for a hybrid cooling system, observing the impact on energy use and indoor comfort.

## 7. Production Task (60 minutes)

Design Challenge: Students work in pairs to conceptualize a mixed-mode cooling system for a public library in Dili, Timor Leste. They should:
- Sketch the building layout and cooling system components
- Describe the passive and mechanical strategies used
- Explain the control logic for switching between modes
- Justify their design choices based on local climate and building use

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Groups present their design concepts to the class
- Instructor summarizes key points and addresses any misconceptions
- Brief Q&A session

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Read Chapter 7 "Hybrid Ventilation" from Santamouris & Asimakopoulos (1996) Passive Cooling of Buildings.
2. Using the energy modeling software, create a simple model of their mixed-mode cooling design from class and run initial performance simulations. Prepare a one-page summary of the results.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Hybrid cooling: A system that combines both passive and mechanical cooling strategies to optimize energy efficiency and thermal comfort.
- Mixed-mode ventilation: A ventilation strategy that uses both natural and mechanical ventilation in a coordinated manner.
- Adaptive comfort: A model of thermal comfort that takes into account human adaptation to different environmental conditions.
- Switchover temperature: The outdoor temperature at which a mixed-mode system changes from natural ventilation to mechanical cooling.
- Building management system (BMS): A computer-based control system that monitors and manages a building's mechanical and electrical equipment, including HVAC systems.
