# Lecture Notes

## Introduction to Hybrid Cooling Systems

- Definition: Hybrid cooling systems combine passive and mechanical cooling strategies to optimize energy efficiency and thermal comfort
- Rationale:
  - Leverage benefits of both passive and active systems
  - Adapt to changing outdoor conditions and occupancy patterns
  - Reduce overall energy consumption compared to purely mechanical systems
- Types of hybrid systems:
  1. Concurrent: Passive and mechanical systems operate simultaneously
  2. Changeover: System switches between passive and mechanical modes based on conditions
  3. Zoned: Different zones use passive or mechanical cooling as needed

## Components of Mixed-Mode Cooling Strategies

### Passive Elements
- Natural ventilation (cross-ventilation, stack effect)
- Thermal mass for heat storage and night cooling
- Shading devices to reduce solar heat gain
- Cool roofs and walls

### Mechanical Elements
- Fans (ceiling fans, exhaust fans)
- Chillers and air handling units
- Radiant cooling systems
- Evaporative coolers

### Control Systems and Sensors
- Temperature sensors (indoor and outdoor)
- Humidity sensors
- Occupancy sensors
- CO2 sensors for air quality
- Weather stations for wind speed and direction
- Building Management System (BMS) for integration and control

## Performance Optimization in Hybrid Systems

### Energy Efficiency Considerations
- Minimize mechanical cooling runtime
- Optimize fan power consumption
- Use free cooling when outdoor conditions permit
- Implement night purge strategies

### Thermal Comfort Standards
- ASHRAE Standard 55
- ISO 7730
- Local Timorese comfort expectations

### Adaptive Comfort Models
- Account for occupant acclimatization
- Allow for wider temperature ranges in naturally ventilated spaces
- Consider cultural factors and local climate adaptation

## Control Strategies for Mixed-Mode Cooling

- Switchover temperature: Point at which system changes from natural to mechanical cooling
- Time-based scheduling: Predetermined schedules for mode changes
- Occupancy-based control: Adjust cooling strategy based on occupancy levels
- Predictive control: Use weather forecasts to optimize system operation
- Manual override options for occupant control

## Energy Modeling and Performance Evaluation

- Importance of accurate climate data for Timor Leste
- Key performance indicators:
  - Energy Use Intensity (EUI)
  - Cooling degree hours
  - Thermal comfort metrics (e.g., Predicted Mean Vote, Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied)
- Comparison with baseline (conventional air-conditioned) building
- Life cycle cost analysis

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay comparing and contrasting the potential benefits and challenges of implementing a mixed-mode cooling system in a public building (e.g., a library or school) versus a residential building in Timor Leste. Consider factors such as occupancy patterns, user expectations, energy availability, and maintenance requirements. Conclude with recommendations for which building type might be more suitable for mixed-mode cooling in the Timorese context.

## Adaptive Comfort Model Explanation

The adaptive comfort model recognizes that people can adapt to a wider range of temperatures than traditionally assumed, especially in naturally ventilated buildings. This model is particularly relevant for Timor Leste's climate and cultural context.

Key points:
1. Comfort temperature is related to outdoor temperature
2. Allows for higher indoor temperatures in warm climates
3. Considers factors like clothing adaptation and air movement
4. Can lead to significant energy savings by reducing cooling needs

Equation for adaptive comfort temperature (ASHRAE Standard 55-2017):
Tcomf = 0.31 * Tpma(out) + 17.8

Where:
Tcomf = Comfort temperature (°C)
Tpma(out) = Prevailing mean outdoor air temperature (°C)
