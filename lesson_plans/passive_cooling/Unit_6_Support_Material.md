# Support Material for Lesson: Integration of Passive and Mechanical Systems

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Hybrid cooling**: A system that combines both passive and mechanical cooling strategies to optimize energy efficiency and thermal comfort.
- **Mixed-mode ventilation**: A ventilation strategy that uses both natural and mechanical ventilation in a coordinated manner.
- **Adaptive comfort**: A model of thermal comfort that takes into account human adaptation to different environmental conditions.
- **Switchover temperature**: The outdoor temperature at which a mixed-mode system changes from natural ventilation to mechanical cooling.
- **Building management system (BMS)**: A computer-based control system that monitors and manages a building's mechanical and electrical equipment, including HVAC systems.
- **Concurrent mixed-mode**: A hybrid system where both natural and mechanical cooling operate simultaneously.
- **Changeover mixed-mode**: A hybrid system that switches between natural and mechanical cooling based on conditions.
- **Zoned mixed-mode**: A hybrid system where different zones of a building use different cooling strategies simultaneously.
- **Thermal mass**: Building materials with high heat capacity that can absorb and store thermal energy.
- **Night purge ventilation**: The use of cool nighttime air to remove heat stored in a building's thermal mass during the day.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with energy modeling software
   - Solution: Provide step-by-step tutorials and consider pairing more experienced students with beginners.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in applying concepts to Timor Leste's specific context
   - Solution: Invite local practitioners as guest speakers and use plenty of regional case studies.

3. Challenge: Balancing technical details with big-picture design thinking
   - Solution: Use the "think-pair-share" method to encourage both individual reflection and collaborative problem-solving.

4. Challenge: Students fixating on either passive or mechanical solutions
   - Solution: Emphasize the importance of integration through real-world examples and performance data comparisons.

5. Challenge: Limited understanding of local building practices
   - Solution: Organize a field trip or virtual tour of traditional and modern buildings in Timor Leste.

6. Challenge: Misconceptions about the effectiveness of hybrid systems
   - Solution: Use simulation tools to demonstrate performance under various conditions and compare with conventional systems.
