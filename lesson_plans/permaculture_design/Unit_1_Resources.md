# Detailed Resources for Learning Unit 1

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Introduction to Permaculture

#### Definition and Origins
- Permaculture: A contraction of "permanent agriculture" or "permanent culture"
- Developed in the 1970s by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in Australia
- Aims to create sustainable human settlements by mimicking natural ecosystems

#### Permaculture Ethics
1. Earth Care: Provision for all life systems to continue and multiply
2. People Care: Provision for people to access those resources necessary for their existence
3. Fair Share: Setting limits to consumption and reproduction, and redistributing surplus

#### 12 Principles of Permaculture
1. Observe and interact
2. Catch and store energy
3. Obtain a yield
4. Apply self-regulation and accept feedback
5. Use and value renewable resources and services
6. Produce no waste
7. Design from patterns to details
8. Integrate rather than segregate
9. Use small and slow solutions
10. Use and value diversity
11. Use edges and value the marginal
12. Creatively use and respond to change

### Overview of Permagardens

#### Definition and Key Features
- A permagarden is a small-scale, intensively managed garden that applies permaculture principles
- Key features:
  * Diverse plant species
  * Efficient use of space
  * Water conservation techniques
  * Soil improvement methods
  * Integration of animals and insects

#### Benefits of Permagardens
- Increased food security
- Improved nutrition
- Enhanced resilience to climate change
- Reduced environmental impact
- Economic benefits through reduced input costs and potential income generation

### Local Context: Timor-Leste's Agricultural Challenges

#### Climate and Soil Conditions
- Tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons
- Mountainous terrain with varied microclimates
- Soil types: predominantly clay and sandy loams
- Soil degradation due to deforestation and erosion

#### Major Agricultural Challenges
1. Water scarcity during dry season
2. Soil erosion and degradation
3. Limited access to agricultural inputs
4. Vulnerability to climate change impacts
5. Post-harvest losses due to inadequate storage

#### How Permaculture and Permagardens Address These Challenges
- Water management techniques (e.g., swales, mulching)
- Soil improvement methods (e.g., composting, cover cropping)
- Use of locally available resources
- Diverse, climate-resilient crop selection
- Integrated pest management

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How do the principles of permaculture differ from conventional agricultural practices in Timor-Leste?
2. In what ways can permagardens contribute to improved food security for Timorese families?
3. Which permaculture principles do you think are most relevant to addressing agricultural challenges in Timor-Leste? Why?
4. How might traditional Timorese agricultural practices align with or differ from permaculture principles?
5. What potential cultural or social barriers might exist in implementing permagardens in Timorese communities? How could these be addressed?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Imagine you are tasked with introducing permagardens to a rural community in Timor-Leste. Describe the steps you would take to engage the community, address potential concerns, and implement a successful permagarden project. Consider local cultural practices, available resources, and potential challenges in your response."

## 4. Assignment Details

### Permaculture Principles Application

1. Observe your home or community garden for at least 30 minutes.
2. Identify three ways you could apply permaculture principles to improve the garden.
3. Write a short reflection (200-300 words) on how permagardens could benefit your community.
4. Include in your reflection:
   - Current gardening practices observed
   - Specific permaculture principles that could be applied
   - Potential benefits and challenges of implementing permagardens

## 5. Additional Materials and Examples

### Case Study: Successful Permagarden in Timor-Leste

Read the following case study and be prepared to discuss it in the next class:

"Maria's Permagarden Success"

Maria, a farmer in Aileu district, implemented a permagarden on her small plot of land two years ago. She started by observing her land's natural patterns and designing a garden that maximized sunlight and natural water flow. Maria incorporated swales to capture rainwater and used mulching to conserve soil moisture during the dry season.

She planted a diverse range of crops, including staples like cassava and sweet potato, alongside nutritious vegetables like moringa and leafy greens. Maria also integrated nitrogen-fixing plants to improve soil fertility and used companion planting to naturally manage pests.

As a result, Maria's garden now produces food year-round, has improved her family's nutrition, and generates a small income from surplus produce. The garden has also shown resilience during periods of drought, maintaining productivity when other gardens in the area struggled.

### Visual Aid: Permaculture Design Elements

[Include a diagram or image showing key elements of a permaculture design, such as zones, sectors, water management features, and diverse planting areas.]

### Local Resource List

- Native plant species suitable for permagardens in Timor-Leste
- Local organic materials for composting and mulching
- Traditional Timorese agricultural tools and their uses in permagardens
- Contact information for local permaculture practitioners or organizations

This comprehensive set of resources should provide a solid foundation for teaching Learning Unit 1 on Introduction to Permaculture and Permagardens in the context of Timor-Leste.
