# Support Material for Introduction to Permaculture and Permagardens

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Permaculture**: A design approach for sustainable living and land use based on natural ecosystems
- **Permagarden**: A small-scale, intensively managed garden that applies permaculture principles
- **Sustainability**: The ability to maintain or support a process continuously over time
- **Biodiversity**: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
- **Food security**: The state of having reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food
- **Resilience**: The capacity to recover quickly from difficulties or adapt to changing conditions
- **Earth Care**: A permaculture ethic focused on caring for the planet and its systems
- **People Care**: A permaculture ethic centered on taking care of oneself and others
- **Fair Share**: A permaculture ethic about equitable distribution of resources and limiting consumption

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Permaculture Ethics Diagram**: 
   A circular diagram showing the three interconnected ethics of permaculture: Earth Care, People Care, and Fair Share.

2. **Permaculture Principles Infographic**: 
   A visual representation of the 12 permaculture principles with simple icons and brief explanations.

3. **Permagarden Layout Sketch**: 
   A bird's-eye view sketch of a typical permagarden, showing key features such as swales, raised beds, composting area, and diverse planting zones.

4. **Timor-Leste Agricultural Challenges Map**: 
   A map of Timor-Leste highlighting different regions and their specific agricultural challenges (e.g., water scarcity, soil erosion, limited resources).

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Permaculture Principles Matching Game**: 
   A worksheet with two columns: one listing the 12 permaculture principles and another with real-life gardening scenarios. Participants match principles to scenarios.

2. **Permagarden Design Elements Checklist**: 
   A checklist of common permagarden elements (e.g., swales, compost area, diverse plantings) for participants to use when analyzing garden photos or designs.

3. **Local Gardening Practices Reflection Sheet**: 
   A structured worksheet for participants to document current gardening practices in their community, challenges faced, and potential permaculture solutions.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Introduction to Permaculture" by Bill Mollison and Reny Mia Slay
2. "Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture" by Toby Hemenway
3. "The Permaculture City" by Toby Hemenway
4. Online course: "Permaculture Design Course" by Geoff Lawton
5. Website: Permaculture Research Institute (https://www.permaculturenews.org/)
6. Local resource: Timor-Leste Permaculture Association (if available)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barrier**: 
   - Prepare key terms in both English and Tetum
   - Use visual aids and demonstrations to supplement verbal explanations
   - Encourage participants to explain concepts to each other in their local language

2. **Varying Levels of Gardening Experience**: 
   - Conduct a pre-lesson survey to gauge participants' experience levels
   - Use mixed-experience groups for activities to encourage peer learning
   - Provide additional resources for both beginners and advanced gardeners

3. **Resistance to New Methods**: 
   - Emphasize how permaculture can complement and enhance traditional practices
   - Share success stories from similar contexts or communities
   - Encourage participants to start small and experiment with new techniques

4. **Limited Resources**: 
   - Focus on low-cost, locally available materials for demonstrations and activities
   - Discuss creative alternatives and adaptations for various resources
   - Encourage resource-sharing and community collaboration

5. **Abstract Concepts**: 
   - Use local examples and analogies to explain permaculture principles
   - Incorporate hands-on activities and real-world applications whenever possible
   - Encourage participants to share their own interpretations and examples

6. **Time Management**: 
   - Prioritize key concepts and activities in case of time constraints
   - Prepare additional activities or discussions for groups that move quickly
   - Be flexible and adjust the pace based on participants' engagement and understanding
