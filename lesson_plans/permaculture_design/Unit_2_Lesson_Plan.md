Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 2: Site Assessment and Design, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Site Assessment and Design

## 1. Resources Needed

- Measuring tapes or long strings
- Compasses
- Graph paper and pencils
- Clipboards
- Soil pH test kits
- Shovels or trowels
- Containers for soil samples
- Printed site assessment checklists
- Large sheets of paper for design drafts
- Colored markers or pencils

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Conduct a comprehensive site assessment
- Create a basic permagarden design for a typical Timorese household
- Identify and map key site conditions (slope, sun exposure, water sources, soil type)
- Analyze local resources and constraints for permagarden design

## 3. Warm-up Activity (15 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Ask each group to draw a quick sketch of their ideal garden from memory
- Have groups share their sketches and discuss what factors they considered in their designs

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Site assessment
- Zoning
- Sector analysis
- Microclimates
- Contour lines
- Soil profile

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### 5.1 Site Assessment Techniques
- Explain the importance of thorough site assessment
- Demonstrate how to measure and map site dimensions
- Show techniques for assessing slope and creating contour lines
- Discuss methods for analyzing sun exposure and shade patterns
- Explain how to identify water sources and drainage patterns
- Demonstrate soil sampling and testing techniques

### 5.2 Identifying Local Resources and Constraints
- Discuss how to inventory existing plants and structures
- Explain the importance of identifying local materials for garden construction
- Address common constraints in Timorese households (e.g., limited water, poor soil)

### 5.3 Zoning and Sector Analysis
- Introduce the concept of zoning in permaculture design
- Explain how to conduct a sector analysis (sun, wind, water flow)
- Discuss how to integrate zoning and sector analysis into garden design

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Assign each group a section of the local area to assess
- Have students conduct a mini site assessment using the techniques learned
- Groups should create a rough map of their assigned area, noting key features and conditions

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Based on their site assessments, have students create a basic permagarden design for a typical Timorese household
- Designs should include:
  * Zoning plan
  * Water management features
  * Proposed planting areas
  * Paths and access points
- Encourage students to consider local resources and constraints in their designs

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (20 minutes)

- Have each group briefly present their permagarden design
- Facilitate a class discussion on the challenges faced and solutions found
- Review key points of site assessment and design principles

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students should conduct a site assessment of their own home or a neighbor's property
- Create a detailed site map and initial permagarden design based on the assessment
- Write a short reflection on how local conditions and resources influenced their design choices

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Site assessment: The process of evaluating and documenting the characteristics of a location for garden design purposes.
- Zoning: The practice of dividing a garden into areas based on frequency of use and maintenance needs.
- Sector analysis: The process of identifying and mapping external influences on a site, such as sun, wind, and water flow.
- Microclimates: Small-scale variations in climate within a larger area, often influenced by landscape features.
- Contour lines: Imaginary lines on the ground that connect points of equal elevation, used for understanding and working with slope.
- Soil profile: A vertical cross-section of soil layers, revealing its composition and characteristics at different depths.
