# Resources for Learning Unit 2: Site Assessment and Design

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Topic: Mapping and Analyzing Site Conditions

#### Introduction to Site Assessment
- Definition: A systematic evaluation of a location's characteristics relevant to garden design
- Importance: Informs design decisions, maximizes efficiency, and minimizes potential problems
- Key elements: Topography, sun exposure, water sources, soil conditions, existing vegetation, and structures

#### Measuring and Mapping the Site
- Tools: Measuring tape, compass, graph paper, pencils
- Steps:
  1. Measure the site's boundaries
  2. Create a base map to scale
  3. Mark cardinal directions (N, S, E, W)
  4. Note existing features (buildings, trees, paths)

#### Assessing Slope
- Importance: Affects water flow, erosion, and planting strategies
- Measurement techniques:
  1. A-frame level method
  2. String level method
- Creating contour lines:
  1. Mark points of equal elevation
  2. Connect points to create contour lines
  3. Interpret contour map for garden design

#### Analyzing Sun Exposure
- Importance: Determines plant placement and microclimates
- Observation methods:
  1. Sun path diagrams
  2. Shade mapping throughout the day
  3. Seasonal variations in sun exposure

#### Water Sources and Drainage
- Identify:
  1. Natural water sources (streams, springs)
  2. Existing water infrastructure (taps, wells)
  3. Rainwater collection potential
- Assess drainage patterns:
  1. Observe during rainfall
  2. Look for signs of erosion or water accumulation

#### Soil Assessment
- Importance: Determines soil improvement needs and plant selection
- Basic tests:
  1. Soil texture (sand, silt, clay ratios)
  2. pH level
  3. Organic matter content
- Soil sampling technique:
  1. Collect samples from multiple locations and depths
  2. Mix samples for a representative composite

### Topic: Identifying Local Resources and Constraints

#### Resource Inventory
- Natural resources:
  1. Native plants for integration or inspiration
  2. Local materials for construction (stones, bamboo, etc.)
  3. Water sources
- Human resources:
  1. Local knowledge and skills
  2. Community support and labor

#### Common Constraints in Timor-Leste
- Limited water availability during dry seasons
- Soil erosion on steep slopes
- Poor soil fertility in some areas
- Limited access to gardening inputs
- Cultural or social constraints on land use

#### Strategies for Working with Constraints
- Water conservation techniques (mulching, swales)
- Erosion control methods (terracing, contour planting)
- Soil improvement strategies (composting, cover cropping)
- Use of locally adapted plant varieties
- Community engagement and education

### Topic: Zoning and Sector Analysis

#### Introduction to Zoning
- Definition: Organizing the garden based on frequency of use and maintenance needs
- Typical zones in a permagarden:
  1. Zone 0: The house
  2. Zone 1: Intensively used areas (herbs, daily vegetables)
  3. Zone 2: Less frequently accessed areas (fruit trees, compost)
  4. Zone 3: Occasional use areas (main crops, grazing)
  4. Zone 4: Minimal management (forestry, wild harvesting)

#### Sector Analysis
- Definition: Mapping external influences on the site
- Key sectors to analyze:
  1. Sun path (summer and winter)
  2. Prevailing winds
  3. Water flow and drainage
  4. Views (desirable and undesirable)
  5. Fire risk areas
  6. Wildlife corridors

#### Integrating Zoning and Sector Analysis
- Placing elements to maximize benefits and minimize problems
- Examples:
  1. Locating water-hungry plants in natural water collection areas
  2. Using windbreaks to protect sensitive crops
  3. Placing composting areas for convenient access but away from living spaces

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How does the unique climate of Timor-Leste influence site assessment and design considerations for permagardens?
2. What are some traditional Timorese land-use practices that could be incorporated into permagarden design?
3. How might zoning principles need to be adapted for the typical layout of a Timorese household?
4. What are the most significant constraints to permagarden implementation in Timor-Leste, and how can they be addressed through design?
5. How can sector analysis help in creating more resilient gardens in the face of climate change in Timor-Leste?
6. What local resources in Timor-Leste are often overlooked but could be valuable for permagarden design and implementation?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word reflection on how the site assessment process might change your approach to garden design. Consider the following points:

1. What aspects of site assessment were new to you or surprised you?
2. How might thorough site assessment help avoid common gardening problems?
3. Describe a specific example of how understanding a site's characteristics could lead to a more successful garden design.
4. How do you think site assessment techniques might need to be adapted for different regions of Timor-Leste?

## 4. Assignment Details

### Site Assessment and Initial Design Project

#### Objective:
Conduct a comprehensive site assessment and create an initial permagarden design for a typical Timorese household.

#### Steps:
1. Select a site (your home, a neighbor's property, or an assigned location).
2. Conduct a thorough site assessment, including:
   - Measure and map the site
   - Assess slope and create a contour map
   - Analyze sun exposure throughout the day
   - Identify water sources and drainage patterns
   - Conduct basic soil tests
   - Inventory existing plants and structures
   - Note local resources and constraints
3. Create a detailed site map incorporating all assessed elements.
4. Develop an initial permagarden design based on your assessment, including:
   - Zoning plan
   - Integration of sector analysis
   - Proposed water management features
   - Planting areas with suggested crops
   - Paths and access points
5. Write a 1-2 page explanation of your design choices, referencing specific site characteristics and how they influenced your decisions.

#### Deliverables:
- Completed site assessment checklist
- Detailed site map
- Initial permagarden design drawing
- Written explanation of design choices

#### Due Date:
Submit all materials by the beginning of the next class session.
