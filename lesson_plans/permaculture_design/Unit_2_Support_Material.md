# Support Material for Site Assessment and Design Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Site assessment**: The process of evaluating and documenting the characteristics of a location for garden design purposes.
- **Zoning**: The practice of dividing a garden into areas based on frequency of use and maintenance needs.
- **Sector analysis**: The process of identifying and mapping external influences on a site, such as sun, wind, and water flow.
- **Microclimates**: Small-scale variations in climate within a larger area, often influenced by landscape features.
- **Contour lines**: Imaginary lines on the ground that connect points of equal elevation, used for understanding and working with slope.
- **Soil profile**: A vertical cross-section of soil layers, revealing its composition and characteristics at different depths.
- **Permagarden**: A permanent garden designed using permaculture principles to maximize productivity and sustainability.
- **Slope**: The degree of incline of the land surface.
- **Sun exposure**: The amount and duration of sunlight an area receives throughout the day and year.
- **Drainage**: The natural or artificial removal of surface and sub-surface water from an area.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Site Assessment Diagram**: A simple illustration showing key elements to observe during a site assessment, including slope, sun path, water sources, existing vegetation, and structures.

2. **Zoning Diagram**: A concentric circle diagram illustrating the five zones of permaculture design, from Zone 0 (house) to Zone 5 (wilderness).

3. **Sector Analysis Diagram**: An overhead view of a property with arrows indicating different sectors (sun path, prevailing winds, water flow, etc.).

4. **Contour Line Diagram**: A side-view illustration of a sloped area with contour lines drawn to show how they follow the terrain.

5. **Soil Profile Diagram**: A vertical cross-section showing different soil layers (topsoil, subsoil, parent material) and their characteristics.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Site Assessment Checklist**: A comprehensive list of elements to observe and record during a site assessment, including:
   - Site dimensions
   - Slope and contours
   - Sun exposure throughout the day
   - Water sources and drainage patterns
   - Existing vegetation and structures
   - Soil type and quality
   - Local climate data

2. **Permagarden Design Template**: A blank template for students to create their permagarden design, including:
   - Property boundary
   - Existing features (buildings, trees, water sources)
   - Zoning areas
   - Proposed garden beds and paths
   - Water management features
   - Legend for plants and structures

3. **Resource and Constraint Inventory Worksheet**: A table for students to list and describe local resources and constraints that may affect their garden design.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Introduction to Permaculture" by Bill Mollison and Reny Mia Slay
2. "Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture" by Toby Hemenway
3. "The Permaculture Design Course Handbook" by Rob Hopkins
4. Online course: "Permaculture Design for Drylands" by Geoff Lawton
5. Video series: "Permaculture Skills" by the Permaculture Research Institute

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggle with visualizing contour lines.
   **Solution**: Use a hands-on demonstration with a large tarp and objects underneath to create "hills" and "valleys". Use string to show how contour lines would look on this model landscape.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in adapting permaculture principles to local context.
   **Solution**: Invite a local elder or experienced gardener to share traditional practices that align with permaculture principles, helping students bridge modern and traditional knowledge.

3. **Challenge**: Limited access to diverse plant materials for design.
   **Solution**: Create a "plant database" with pictures and information on locally available plants, including their uses, growth habits, and companion planting potential.

4. **Challenge**: Students struggle with sector analysis concept.
   **Solution**: Conduct a group exercise outdoors where students physically act out different elements (sun, wind, water) to help visualize how these factors interact with a site.

5. **Challenge**: Lack of real-world examples in the local area.
   **Solution**: Create a photo or video library of successful permagardens from similar climates around the world, discussing how their design elements could be adapted locally.
