Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 3: Water Management Techniques, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Water Management Techniques for Permagardens in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Shovels, hoes, and picks
- String and stakes for marking
- Buckets and watering cans
- Local mulching materials (straw, leaves, etc.)
- Large sheets of paper and markers
- Handouts with diagrams of water management techniques
- Plastic sheets or tarps for demonstrating rainwater harvesting

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the importance of water management in Timor-Leste's climate
- Identify and describe key water management techniques
- Construct basic swales and berms
- Design a simple rainwater harvesting system

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Ask each group to discuss and list the water-related challenges they face in gardening
- Have groups share their lists, creating a master list on a large sheet of paper

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Swale
- Berm
- Water retention hole
- Mulching
- Rainwater harvesting

Use visual aids and simple demonstrations to illustrate each concept.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### 5.1 Water Management Principles
- Discuss the importance of water conservation in Timor-Leste
- Explain the concept of "slow, spread, and sink" for water management

### 5.2 Swales and Berms
- Define swales and berms and their function
- Demonstrate how to measure and mark contour lines for swale placement

### 5.3 Water Retention Holes
- Explain the purpose and construction of water retention holes
- Discuss placement strategies for maximum effectiveness

### 5.4 Mulching and Shade Techniques
- Present various mulching materials and their benefits
- Discuss shade techniques for reducing evaporation

### 5.5 Rainwater Harvesting
- Introduce simple rainwater harvesting methods suitable for Timor-Leste
- Discuss storage options and considerations

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

### 6.1 Swale and Berm Construction
- Divide students into groups
- Have each group measure and mark a contour line
- Guide students through the process of digging a small swale and forming a berm

### 6.2 Mulching Practice
- Provide various mulching materials
- Have students practice applying mulch to a small area, discussing thickness and coverage

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

### 7.1 Rainwater Harvesting Design
- In pairs, have students design a simple rainwater harvesting system for a typical Timorese home
- Students should create a sketch and list of materials needed

### 7.2 Water Management Plan
- Individually, have students create a water management plan for their own garden or a hypothetical garden
- Plans should incorporate swales, berms, mulching, and rainwater harvesting

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Conduct a brief quiz on key water management concepts
- Review the main points of the lesson
- Address any questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students should implement at least one water management technique in their home garden or a community garden
- Students should observe and document the effects of the technique over the next week

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Swale: A shallow channel dug along the contour of a slope to catch and hold water
- Berm: A raised earth bank or ridge, often paired with a swale to retain water
- Water retention hole: A deep hole filled with organic matter to hold water and slowly release it to surrounding soil
- Mulching: Covering soil with organic material to retain moisture and suppress weeds
- Rainwater harvesting: The collection and storage of rainwater for later use in gardening or other purposes
