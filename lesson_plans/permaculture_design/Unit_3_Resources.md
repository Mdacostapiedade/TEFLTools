# Resources for Learning Unit 3: Water Management Techniques

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Introduction to Water Management in Timor-Leste

- Timor-Leste's climate challenges:
  * Distinct wet and dry seasons
  * Unpredictable rainfall patterns
  * Risk of drought and water scarcity

- Importance of water management:
  * Ensures year-round food production
  * Increases resilience to climate change
  * Maximizes use of available water resources

### Swales and Berms

- Definition:
  * Swale: A shallow, level-bottomed channel on the contour of a slope
  * Berm: The raised earth on the downhill side of the swale

- Functions:
  * Slow down water flow
  * Increase water infiltration into soil
  * Reduce erosion

- Construction steps:
  1. Mark contour lines using an A-frame level
  2. Dig a shallow channel along the contour
  3. Use excavated soil to create a berm on the downhill side
  4. Ensure the swale is level to distribute water evenly

### Water Retention Holes

- Purpose:
  * Store water in the soil profile
  * Slowly release moisture to surrounding areas

- Construction:
  1. Dig holes 60-100cm deep and 30-50cm wide
  2. Fill with organic matter (leaves, straw, compost)
  3. Cover with soil, leaving a slight depression

- Placement:
  * Near trees or deep-rooted plants
  * In areas prone to runoff

### Mulching and Shade Techniques

- Benefits of mulching:
  * Reduces evaporation
  * Suppresses weed growth
  * Improves soil structure over time

- Mulching materials in Timor-Leste:
  * Rice straw
  * Dried leaves
  * Coconut husks
  * Wood chips

- Application:
  * Apply 5-10cm layer around plants
  * Keep mulch away from plant stems to prevent rot

- Shade techniques:
  * Use of shade cloth or palm fronds
  * Planting taller crops to shade smaller ones
  * Creating trellises for climbing plants

### Rainwater Harvesting

- Methods suitable for Timor-Leste:
  * Roof catchment systems
  * Ground catchment systems
  * Check dams in small streams

- Components of a basic roof catchment system:
  1. Catchment area (roof)
  2. Gutters and downpipes
  3. First flush diverter
  4. Storage tank

- Considerations:
  * Tank size based on roof area and rainfall patterns
  * Proper filtration and treatment for drinking water
  * Regular maintenance to ensure clean water

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How do the water management challenges in Timor-Leste differ from those in other countries you're familiar with?

2. What traditional water management techniques are used in Timor-Leste, and how can they be integrated with the methods discussed in this lesson?

3. How might climate change impact water availability in Timor-Leste, and how can permagarden techniques help address these challenges?

4. What are the potential challenges in implementing these water management techniques in local communities, and how might they be overcome?

5. How can rainwater harvesting systems be designed to meet both agricultural and household water needs?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Designing a comprehensive water management plan for a small farm in Timor-Leste"

Your essay should include:
- An analysis of the water-related challenges specific to the region
- A description of at least three water management techniques you would implement
- An explanation of how these techniques would work together to improve water efficiency
- A discussion of potential challenges in implementing the plan and how to address them

## 4. Assignment Details

### Practical Assignment: Swale and Berm Construction

In groups of 3-4, construct a small swale and berm system in a designated area of the training site.

Steps:
1. Use an A-frame level to mark a contour line approximately 5 meters long.
2. Dig a swale along this line, approximately 50cm wide and 30cm deep.
3. Use the excavated soil to create a berm on the downhill side of the swale.
4. Check that the bottom of the swale is level using the A-frame or spirit level.
5. Plant the berm with suitable vegetation (e.g., lemongrass, vetiver grass) to stabilize it.

Document your process with photographs and prepare a short presentation on your experience, including challenges faced and lessons learned.

### Design Assignment: Rainwater Harvesting System

Individually, design a rainwater harvesting system for a typical rural home in Timor-Leste.

Your design should include:
1. A sketch of the system layout
2. Calculations for potential water capture based on local rainfall data
3. List of materials needed and their estimated costs
4. Maintenance plan for the system

Present your design to the class in a 5-minute presentation, explaining your choices and how the system would benefit the household.
