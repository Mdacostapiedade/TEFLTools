# Support Material for Water Management Techniques Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Swale**: A shallow channel dug along the contour of a slope to catch and hold water
- **Berm**: A raised earth bank or ridge, often paired with a swale to retain water
- **Water retention hole**: A deep hole filled with organic matter to hold water and slowly release it to surrounding soil
- **Mulching**: Covering soil with organic material to retain moisture and suppress weeds
- **Rainwater harvesting**: The collection and storage of rainwater for later use in gardening or other purposes
- **Contour line**: An imaginary line on the ground along which all points are at the same elevation
- **Evaporation**: The process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor
- **Infiltration**: The process by which water on the ground surface enters the soil
- **Runoff**: Water from rain or irrigation that flows over the land surface rather than soaking into the ground

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Swale and Berm Diagram**: A cross-section drawing showing a swale (shallow ditch) on contour with a berm (raised earth bank) on the downhill side. Arrows indicate water flow and infiltration.

2. **Water Retention Hole Illustration**: A cutaway diagram of a deep hole filled with layers of organic matter, showing how water is stored and slowly released to surrounding soil.

3. **Mulching Technique Poster**: A series of images showing different mulching materials (straw, leaves, wood chips) and their application around plants.

4. **Simple Rainwater Harvesting System**: A sketch of a typical Timorese home with gutters, downspouts, and a storage tank, showing how rainwater is collected from the roof.

5. **Contour Line Measurement**: An illustration demonstrating how to use an A-frame level to mark contour lines on a slope.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Water Management Technique Comparison Chart**: A table listing different water management techniques (swales, mulching, rainwater harvesting, etc.) with columns for "Benefits," "Materials Needed," and "Best Situations for Use."

2. **Rainwater Harvesting System Design Worksheet**: A template for students to sketch their rainwater harvesting system design, including space to list materials needed and calculate potential water collection based on roof size and local rainfall data.

3. **Garden Water Management Plan**: A blank garden layout grid where students can draw and label planned water management features (swales, berms, mulched areas, etc.) for their home or hypothetical garden.

4. **Water Management Technique Implementation Checklist**: A list of steps for implementing each water management technique, which students can use to track their progress in applying techniques at home.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Water for Every Farm" by P.A. Yeomans - A comprehensive guide to water management in agriculture
2. "Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond" by Brad Lancaster - Detailed information on rainwater harvesting techniques
3. FAO's "Guidelines for Designing and Evaluating Surface Irrigation Systems" - Technical resource for understanding water flow and management
4. Local case studies of successful water management in Timor-Leste gardens (if available)
5. Online video tutorials on swale construction and contour mapping (provide specific links if possible)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggle to understand contour lines
   **Solution**: Use a hands-on demonstration with a large tarp or sheet. Create "hills" underneath and have students walk along the contours, marking them with string.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to tools for swale construction
   **Solution**: Demonstrate alternative methods using locally available tools. Emphasize the principles rather than specific techniques.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty in visualizing water flow
   **Solution**: Use a simple model with sand or soil on a tilted board. Pour water to demonstrate flow and how different structures affect it.

4. **Challenge**: Varying soil types across students' home gardens
   **Solution**: Discuss how different soil types affect water retention and infiltration. Encourage students to share their local knowledge about soil characteristics.

5. **Challenge**: Skepticism about new techniques
   **Solution**: Share success stories from similar climates. If possible, arrange a field trip to a local garden successfully using these techniques.

6. **Challenge**: Translating technical terms into local language
   **Solution**: Work with students to develop locally relevant analogies or descriptions for key concepts. Create a bilingual vocabulary list.

7. **Challenge**: Limited rainfall for demonstrating rainwater harvesting
   **Solution**: Use buckets of water to simulate rain on a small-scale model of a rainwater harvesting system.
