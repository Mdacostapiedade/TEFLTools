Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 4: Soil Preparation and Improvement, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Soil Preparation and Improvement

## 1. Resources Needed

- Shovels, forks, and rakes
- Measuring tape or string
- Organic matter (leaves, grass clippings, food scraps)
- Manure (if available)
- Biochar and wood ash samples
- Buckets
- Watering cans
- Gloves for participants
- Flipchart and markers
- Handouts on double-digging and composting techniques

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, participants will be able to:
- Explain the benefits of double-digging
- Demonstrate the double-digging technique
- Identify materials suitable for composting in Timor-Leste
- Set up a compost pile using local materials
- Understand the use of biochar and wood ash as soil amendments

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Soil texture analysis: Provide participants with small samples of local soil. Ask them to feel the soil and describe its texture, color, and smell. Discuss how these characteristics might affect plant growth.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Double-digging
- Compost
- Soil amendment
- Biochar
- Organic matter
- Aeration

Use visual aids and local language translations where necessary.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Double-digging Method
- Explain the concept and benefits of double-digging
- Demonstrate the double-digging technique step-by-step
- Discuss how double-digging improves soil structure and plant growth

### Composting Techniques
- Introduce the concept of composting and its benefits
- Explain the components of a good compost pile (green and brown materials, water, air)
- Demonstrate how to set up a compost pile using locally available materials
- Discuss different composting methods suitable for Timor-Leste

### Soil Amendments
- Introduce biochar and wood ash as soil amendments
- Explain their benefits and proper application methods
- Discuss other local amendments that could be used (e.g., seaweed, animal manure)

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

Divide participants into small groups for hands-on practice:
- Group 1: Practice double-digging a small garden bed
- Group 2: Set up a compost pile using local materials
- Group 3: Prepare soil amendments (mixing biochar or wood ash with soil)

Rotate groups so everyone gets to practice each activity.

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Each participant designs a soil improvement plan for their home garden, including:
  * Areas to be double-dug
  * Location and materials for a compost pile
  * List of locally available soil amendments to use

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Address any questions or concerns from participants
- Conduct a quick quiz on key concepts (e.g., steps of double-digging, components of a good compost pile)

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Start a compost pile at home using materials available in their community
- Practice double-digging a small area in their garden
- Record observations about soil quality and any challenges faced

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Double-digging: A gardening technique where soil is dug to twice the depth of a normal spade, improving aeration and drainage.
- Compost: Decomposed organic matter used as a fertilizer and soil amendment.
- Soil amendment: Any material added to soil to improve its physical or chemical properties.
- Biochar: A type of charcoal used as a soil amendment to increase fertility and carbon sequestration.
- Organic matter: Plant and animal residues in various stages of decomposition.
- Aeration: The process of introducing air into soil or compost to promote healthy microbial activity.
