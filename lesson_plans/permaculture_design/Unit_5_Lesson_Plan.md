Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 5: Planting Techniques and Crop Selection, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Planting Techniques and Crop Selection

## 1. Resources Needed

- Garden space or raised beds for practical activities
- Various vegetable seeds suitable for Timor-Leste
- Garden tools (hoes, trowels, string, measuring tape)
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with crop information and planting calendars
- Flip chart paper and colored markers

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand and apply bio-intensive planting methods
- Implement triangular spacing and companion planting techniques
- Create a crop rotation and succession planting plan
- Select appropriate crops for Timor-Leste's climate and nutritional needs

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Each group brainstorms and lists as many local crops as they can in 5 minutes
- Groups share their lists, discussing which crops are most common and why

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Bio-intensive planting
- Triangular spacing
- Companion planting
- Crop rotation
- Succession planting

Use visual aids and simple demonstrations to illustrate these concepts.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Bio-intensive Planting Methods
- Explain the principles of bio-intensive planting
- Discuss benefits: increased yield, soil health, water conservation

### Triangular Spacing and Companion Planting
- Demonstrate triangular spacing using a diagram
- Explain benefits: maximizes space, reduces competition
- Introduce companion planting concept and examples relevant to Timor-Leste

### Crop Rotation and Succession Planting
- Explain the importance of crop rotation for soil health and pest management
- Demonstrate a simple 4-year rotation plan
- Discuss succession planting for continuous harvest

### Crop Selection for Timor-Leste
- Present a list of nutritious, climate-appropriate crops for Timor-Leste
- Discuss nutritional benefits and growing requirements of each crop

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

### Activity 1: Triangular Spacing Practice
- In small groups, students practice triangular spacing in a garden bed
- Use string and measuring tape to create proper spacing for different crops

### Activity 2: Companion Planting Design
- Students work in pairs to design a small garden plot using companion planting principles
- Share designs with the class and discuss choices

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

### Task: Create a Seasonal Planting Calendar
- In groups, students create a seasonal planting calendar for Timor-Leste
- Include at least 10 crops, showing planting and harvesting times
- Consider crop rotation and succession planting in the design

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Quick quiz on main concepts (e.g., benefits of triangular spacing, examples of companion plants)

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a one-page report on a traditional Timorese crop, including its nutritional value, growing requirements, and cultural significance
- Design a small home garden plot incorporating the techniques learned in class

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Bio-intensive planting: A method of maximizing crop yield from a small area of land while increasing biodiversity and sustaining soil fertility
- Triangular spacing: Planting crops in a triangular pattern to maximize space utilization and reduce competition
- Companion planting: Growing different plants together for mutual benefit, such as pest control or improved growth
- Crop rotation: The practice of planting different crops sequentially in the same field to improve soil health and reduce pest and disease problems
- Succession planting: Planting crops at regular intervals to ensure a continuous harvest throughout the growing season
