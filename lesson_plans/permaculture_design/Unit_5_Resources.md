# Resources for Learning Unit 5: Planting Techniques and Crop Selection

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Bio-intensive Planting Methods

- Definition: A sustainable agricultural system that focuses on maximizing crop yields from a minimal land area while increasing biodiversity and maintaining soil fertility.
- Key principles:
  1. Deep soil preparation (double-digging)
  2. Composting
  3. Intensive planting (close spacing)
  4. Companion planting
  5. Carbon farming
  6. Calorie farming
  7. Open-pollinated seeds
  8. Whole-system approach
- Benefits:
  - Increased yields (up to 2-4 times conventional yields)
  - Reduced water usage (up to 88% less per unit of production)
  - Builds and maintains soil fertility
  - Reduces energy use
  - Suitable for small-scale farming in Timor-Leste

### Triangular Spacing and Companion Planting

- Triangular spacing:
  - Definition: Planting crops in a triangular pattern rather than in rows
  - Benefits:
    1. Maximizes space utilization
    2. Reduces competition between plants
    3. Creates a living mulch effect
    4. Increases yields per area
  - Implementation:
    1. Determine optimal spacing for each crop
    2. Create a grid using string or markers
    3. Plant at each intersection point of the grid

- Companion planting:
  - Definition: Growing different plants together for mutual benefit
  - Benefits:
    1. Pest control
    2. Pollination
    3. Providing nutrients
    4. Maximizing space use
  - Examples relevant to Timor-Leste:
    1. Three Sisters: Corn, beans, and squash
    2. Tomatoes and basil
    3. Carrots and onions
    4. Marigolds as a pest-repelling border plant

### Crop Rotation and Succession Planting

- Crop rotation:
  - Definition: Practice of planting different crops sequentially in the same field
  - Benefits:
    1. Improves soil health
    2. Reduces pest and disease problems
    3. Manages soil fertility
    4. Increases biodiversity
  - Basic 4-year rotation plan:
    Year 1: Leaf crops (e.g., cabbage, lettuce)
    Year 2: Fruit crops (e.g., tomatoes, peppers)
    Year 3: Root crops (e.g., carrots, onions)
    Year 4: Legumes (e.g., beans, peas)

- Succession planting:
  - Definition: Planting crops at regular intervals to ensure continuous harvest
  - Benefits:
    1. Extends harvest season
    2. Provides steady supply of fresh produce
    3. Maximizes garden productivity
  - Implementation:
    1. Plant same crop every 2-3 weeks
    2. Use varieties with different maturation times
    3. Interplant quick-growing crops with slow-growing ones

### Crop Selection for Timor-Leste

- Factors to consider:
  1. Climate adaptability
  2. Nutritional value
  3. Cultural preferences
  4. Market demand
  5. Seed availability

- Recommended crops for Timor-Leste:
  1. Leafy greens: Kankung, mustard greens, amaranth
  2. Fruiting vegetables: Tomatoes, eggplant, peppers
  3. Root crops: Sweet potatoes, cassava, taro
  4. Legumes: Mung beans, soybeans, peanuts
  5. Staples: Maize, rice
  6. Fruit trees: Papaya, banana, mango

- Nutritional benefits and growing requirements for each crop (to be elaborated in class)

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How can bio-intensive planting methods address food security challenges in Timor-Leste?
2. What are the potential challenges of implementing triangular spacing in traditional Timorese gardens, and how can these be overcome?
3. Discuss the cultural significance of companion planting in Timor-Leste. Are there traditional practices that align with this concept?
4. How might climate change impact crop rotation and succession planting strategies in Timor-Leste? What adaptations might be necessary?
5. Consider the nutritional needs of a typical Timorese family. Which crops would you prioritize in a home garden, and why?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Design a small-scale permagarden (10m x 10m) for a rural Timorese family, incorporating bio-intensive planting methods, triangular spacing, companion planting, and crop rotation. Explain your choices of crops and planting techniques, considering local climate, nutritional needs, and cultural preferences."

Include the following in your essay:
- A sketch of the garden layout
- A list of selected crops with justifications
- Explanation of planting techniques used
- A basic crop rotation plan for 2 years

## 4. Assignment Details

### Seasonal Planting Calendar for Timor-Leste

Create a detailed seasonal planting calendar for Timor-Leste, considering the following:

1. Include at least 10 crops suitable for the local climate
2. Show planting and harvesting times for each crop
3. Consider crop rotation principles in your design
4. Indicate any companion planting recommendations
5. Include notes on specific varieties suited for different elevations in Timor-Leste

Format: The calendar should be created on a large sheet of paper (A3 size if possible) and can be hand-drawn or computer-generated. Use colors to differentiate crops and planting/harvesting periods.

Submission: Bring your completed calendar to the next class for presentation and discussion.
