# Support Materials for Planting Techniques and Crop Selection Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Bio-intensive planting**: A method of maximizing crop yield from a small area of land while increasing biodiversity and sustaining soil fertility.
- **Triangular spacing**: Planting crops in a triangular pattern to maximize space utilization and reduce competition.
- **Companion planting**: Growing different plants together for mutual benefit, such as pest control or improved growth.
- **Crop rotation**: The practice of planting different crops sequentially in the same field to improve soil health and reduce pest and disease problems.
- **Succession planting**: Planting crops at regular intervals to ensure a continuous harvest throughout the growing season.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Triangular Spacing Diagram:
   A diagram showing plants arranged in equilateral triangles, with measurements for common crop spacings (e.g., 30cm for leafy greens, 45cm for tomatoes).

2. Companion Planting Chart:
   A simple chart showing compatible plant combinations relevant to Timor-Leste, such as:
   - Tomatoes + Basil
   - Corn + Beans + Squash (Three Sisters)
   - Carrots + Onions

3. 4-Year Crop Rotation Diagram:
   A circular diagram divided into four sections, each representing a year and a plant family:
   - Year 1: Legumes (beans, peas)
   - Year 2: Fruiting vegetables (tomatoes, peppers)
   - Year 3: Leaf crops (lettuce, cabbage)
   - Year 4: Root crops (carrots, onions)

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Crop Information Sheet:
   A table listing 10-15 common crops in Timor-Leste, including:
   - Plant name (in Tetum and English)
   - Planting season
   - Growth duration
   - Spacing requirements
   - Nutritional benefits

2. Seasonal Planting Calendar Template:
   A blank 12-month calendar with space to fill in planting and harvesting times for different crops.

3. Garden Design Worksheet:
   A grid paper template for students to design a small garden plot, incorporating companion planting and triangular spacing.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Tropical Permaculture Guidebook" - Chapter on Planting Techniques
2. "Gardening in the Tropics" by Kathy Arbuckle
3. FAO Guide: "A vegetable garden for all" (available in Portuguese)
4. Online resource: Tropical Permaculture website (www.tropicalpermaculture.com)
5. Local agricultural extension office fact sheets on crop varieties suitable for Timor-Leste

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language barriers:
   - Use visual aids and hands-on demonstrations as much as possible
   - Provide handouts in both Tetum and English
   - Encourage students to explain concepts to each other in their local language

2. Limited gardening experience:
   - Start with simple, familiar crops before introducing new varieties
   - Provide ample time for hands-on practice in the garden
   - Encourage students to start small gardens at home and report back on their progress

3. Resistance to new techniques:
   - Explain the benefits of new methods in relation to local challenges (e.g., water scarcity, poor soil)
   - Invite local successful gardeners to share their experiences with new techniques
   - Set up a demonstration plot to show the results of bio-intensive methods over time

4. Lack of resources:
   - Focus on techniques that use locally available materials
   - Encourage resource sharing and community cooperation
   - Teach seed saving techniques to reduce dependence on purchased seeds

5. Climate variability:
   - Emphasize the importance of crop diversity and succession planting
   - Teach water conservation techniques alongside planting methods
   - Discuss climate-resilient crop varieties and adaptive planting strategies
