Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 6: Garden Maintenance and Pest Management, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Garden Maintenance and Pest Management

## 1. Resources Needed

- Various local plants known for pest-repelling properties
- Containers for mixing natural pest control solutions
- Mortar and pestle for grinding plants
- Seeds from local crop varieties
- Paper envelopes or small containers for seed storage
- Gardening tools (hoes, trowels, pruning shears)
- Mulching materials (straw, leaves, grass clippings)
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on natural pest control recipes and seed saving techniques

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Implement sustainable garden maintenance practices
- Create natural pest control solutions using local plants
- Demonstrate proper seed saving techniques for local crop varieties

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide the class into small groups
- Ask each group to brainstorm and list common garden pests in Timor-Leste and any traditional methods they know for controlling these pests
- Have groups share their lists with the class, creating a master list on the whiteboard

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Organic pest management
- Beneficial insects
- Companion planting
- Seed viability
- Fermentation (in context of seed saving)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### 5.1 Sustainable Garden Maintenance
- Discuss the importance of regular weeding and its impact on plant health
- Explain mulching techniques and benefits (water retention, weed suppression, soil health)
- Demonstrate proper pruning techniques for common garden plants

### 5.2 Organic Pest Management
- Introduce the concept of integrated pest management (IPM)
- Present various natural pest control methods using local plants
- Explain companion planting as a pest management strategy

### 5.3 Seed Saving Techniques
- Discuss the importance of seed saving for food security and biodiversity
- Explain the basic principles of seed selection and storage
- Demonstrate seed saving techniques for different types of crops (wet and dry processing)

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

### 6.1 Natural Pest Control Solution Preparation (25 minutes)
- Divide the class into groups
- Provide each group with local pest-repelling plants and necessary tools
- Guide students in preparing 2-3 different natural pest control solutions

### 6.2 Seed Saving Practice (20 minutes)
- Demonstrate seed saving techniques for 2-3 local crop varieties
- Have students practice these techniques with provided seeds

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Have students create an illustrated guide for natural pest control solutions
- Ask students to develop a seed saving plan for a small garden, including a calendar for seed collection

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Conduct a brief quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Facilitate a group discussion on how these techniques can be applied in students' own gardens or communities

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and document traditional Timorese pest management techniques by interviewing elders or experienced gardeners in their community
- Start a seed saving project at home with at least two different crop varieties

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Organic pest management: Controlling pests using natural methods without synthetic chemicals
- Beneficial insects: Insects that help control pests or pollinate plants
- Companion planting: Growing certain plants together for mutual benefit, including pest control
- Seed viability: The ability of a seed to germinate and produce a healthy plant
- Fermentation: A process used in wet seed processing to remove the gel coating from some seeds
