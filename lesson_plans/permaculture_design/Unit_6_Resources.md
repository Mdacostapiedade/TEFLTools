# Resources for Learning Unit 6: Garden Maintenance and Pest Management

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Sustainable Garden Maintenance

#### Weeding Strategies
- Importance of regular weeding
  * Reduces competition for nutrients, water, and sunlight
  * Prevents pests and diseases from spreading
  * Improves overall garden aesthetics
- Weeding techniques
  * Hand pulling: Best for small areas and when soil is moist
  * Hoeing: Effective for larger areas, but be careful not to disturb shallow-rooted plants
  * Mulching: Suppresses weed growth and conserves soil moisture

#### Mulching
- Benefits of mulching
  * Conserves soil moisture
  * Suppresses weed growth
  * Regulates soil temperature
  * Adds organic matter to soil as it decomposes
- Types of mulch suitable for Timor-Leste
  * Organic: Straw, leaves, grass clippings, coconut husks
  * Inorganic: Gravel, stones (for pathways and non-edible areas)
- Application techniques
  * Apply 2-4 inches of mulch around plants, avoiding direct contact with stems
  * Replenish mulch as it decomposes or is blown away

### Organic Pest Management

#### Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
- Definition: A holistic approach to pest management that uses multiple techniques to keep pest populations at acceptable levels
- Key components of IPM
  * Prevention
  * Monitoring
  * Cultural controls
  * Physical controls
  * Biological controls
  * Chemical controls (as a last resort, using organic options)

#### Natural Pest Control Methods
- Plant-based repellents and insecticides
  * Neem (Azadirachta indica) - leaves and seeds
  * Chili peppers
  * Garlic
  * Marigolds
- Companion planting
  * Definition: Growing certain plants together for mutual benefit
  * Examples:
    - Tomatoes with basil (repels flies and mosquitoes)
    - Corn with beans and squash (traditional "Three Sisters" planting)
- Physical barriers
  * Row covers
  * Sticky traps
  * Copper tape for snail and slug control

#### Beneficial Insects
- Importance of attracting and preserving beneficial insects
- Examples of beneficial insects in Timor-Leste
  * Ladybugs (eat aphids)
  * Praying mantises (eat various pests)
  * Parasitic wasps (lay eggs in pest insects)
- How to attract beneficial insects
  * Plant flowers that provide nectar and pollen
  * Provide water sources (shallow dishes with pebbles)
  * Avoid broad-spectrum pesticides

### Seed Saving and Propagation

#### Importance of Seed Saving
- Preserves local biodiversity
- Ensures access to locally adapted varieties
- Reduces dependence on external seed sources
- Saves money for farmers and gardeners

#### Seed Selection
- Choose healthy, disease-free plants
- Select seeds from plants with desirable traits
- Consider genetic diversity by selecting from multiple plants of the same variety

#### Seed Saving Techniques
- Dry processing (for beans, peas, corn, etc.)
  * Allow seeds to dry on the plant
  * Harvest when pods are brown and crisp
  * Further dry seeds in a well-ventilated area
  * Store in airtight containers in a cool, dry place
- Wet processing (for tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.)
  * Scoop out seeds with pulp
  * Ferment in water for 2-3 days to remove gel coating
  * Rinse and dry seeds thoroughly before storage

#### Seed Storage
- Use airtight containers (glass jars, paper envelopes)
- Label containers with crop name, variety, and date
- Store in a cool, dry, dark place
- Check viability periodically with germination tests

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. What are some traditional weeding and mulching practices in Timor-Leste? How can these be integrated with modern permaculture techniques?

2. Discuss the potential challenges of implementing organic pest management in Timor-Leste. How can these challenges be addressed?

3. How might climate change affect pest populations and management strategies in Timor-Leste? What adaptations might be necessary?

4. What are the social and economic implications of seed saving for Timorese farmers and gardeners?

5. How can we encourage more people in Timor-Leste to adopt sustainable garden maintenance practices?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. The importance of preserving local seed varieties in Timor-Leste
2. Developing a community-based pest management program for a village in Timor-Leste
3. Comparing and contrasting traditional and modern garden maintenance techniques in Timor-Leste

Your essay should include:
- An introduction stating your main argument or focus
- At least three main points supporting your argument
- Specific examples relevant to Timor-Leste
- A conclusion summarizing your key points and their implications

## 4. Assignment Details

### Natural Pest Control Solution Project

1. Research and document at least three traditional pest control methods used in Timor-Leste.
2. Develop and test two natural pest control solutions using locally available materials.
3. Create an illustrated guide for each solution, including:
   - List of ingredients and materials needed
   - Step-by-step instructions for preparation
   - Application methods and frequency
   - Target pests and effectiveness
4. Present your findings to the class, including any challenges encountered and suggestions for improvement.

### Seed Saving Project

1. Select two local crop varieties for a seed saving project.
2. Document the entire seed saving process for each crop, including:
   - Plant selection criteria
   - Harvesting method and timing
   - Processing technique (wet or dry)
   - Drying and storage methods
3. Create a seed saving calendar for your chosen crops, indicating optimal times for planting, harvesting, and seed collection.
4. Conduct a germination test on your saved seeds and report the results.
5. Prepare a short presentation on the importance of your chosen crop varieties and the benefits of saving their seeds.
