## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Natural Pest Control for Home & Garden" by Linda Gilkeson
2. "Seed to Seed: Seed Saving and Growing Techniques for Vegetable Gardeners" by Suzanne Ashworth
3. Online resource: FAO's Farmer Field School guide on Integrated Pest Management
4. Local resource: Timor-Leste Ministry of Agriculture's guide on traditional pest management techniques (if available)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited availability of specific pest-repelling plants
   - Solution: Prepare a list of alternative local plants with similar properties. Encourage students to research and share traditional pest control methods from their communities.

2. Challenge: Students struggling with seed saving techniques
   - Solution: Create small groups with mixed experience levels. Provide extra hands-on practice sessions and consider inviting a local expert to demonstrate techniques.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in identifying pests and beneficial insects
   - Solution: Create a visual guide with common local pests and beneficial insects. Organize a "bug hunt" activity to practice identification in the field.

4. Challenge: Resistance to organic pest management methods
   - Solution: Share success stories from local farmers using organic methods. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis comparing organic and chemical pest control.

5. Challenge: Varying levels of gardening experience among students
   - Solution: Use a buddy system pairing experienced gardeners with beginners. Provide additional resources for both basic and advanced techniques.
