- Ensures relevance and sustainability of permagarden projects

#### Integration Strategies
1. Conduct thorough community assessments
   - Understand existing agricultural practices
   - Identify cultural taboos or preferences related to food and farming

2. Incorporate traditional crops and techniques
   - Use local varieties alongside introduced crops
   - Adapt planting calendars to traditional agricultural cycles

3. Modify garden designs
   - Adjust layout to accommodate cultural preferences (e.g., separate male/female areas if necessary)
   - Integrate traditional decorative elements or symbolic plants

4. Adapt teaching methods
   - Use local languages and dialects
   - Incorporate traditional learning styles (e.g., storytelling, proverbs)

5. Respect local decision-making processes

   - Allow for community consensus-building

#### Case Study: Integrating Ai-lebo' in Timor-Leste Permagardens
- Ai-lebo' is a traditional Timorese practice of using tree branches for soil improvement
- Permagarden projects incorporated ai-lebo' into compost production
- Result: Increased acceptance of composting techniques and improved soil fertility
