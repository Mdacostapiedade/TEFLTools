INTRODUCTIONCHAPTER 10Special Relativity
10.1 Postulates of Special Relativity
10.2 Consequences of Special Relativity
The theory of special relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in 1905. It was developed to explain
some observations that could not be adequately explained by classical physics. The theory of special relativity is based on two
postulates stated by Einstein. One consequence of the theory is that time passes more slowly for a moving object than for a
stationary object. This effect is called time dilation. Another consequence is that the length of an object is shorter in the direction
of motion than when it is at rest. This effect is called length contraction. The theory of special relativity also predicts that mass
and energy are equivalent. This equivalence is expressed in Einstein's famous equation E = mc2.

Postulates of Special Relativity
The theory of special relativity is based on two postulates stated by Einstein. A postulate is a statement that is assumed to be
true for the purpose of developing a theory. The two postulates of special relativity are:
1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.
2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion relative to the source of light.
The first postulate is a statement of the principle of relativity. This principle states that the laws of physics are the same in all
inertial frames of reference. An inertial frame of reference is a frame of reference that is not accelerating. For example, a car
traveling at a constant velocity is an inertial frame of reference. A car that is accelerating is not an inertial frame of reference.
The second postulate is a statement of the constancy of the speed of light. This postulate states that the speed of light in a
vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion relative to the source of light. This postulate is in direct conflict
with classical physics, which states that the speed of light depends on the motion of the observer relative to the source of light.
The theory of special relativity is based on these two postulates. The theory of special relativity is a theory that describes the
behavior of space and time in different inertial frames of reference. The theory of special relativity is a theory that describes the
behavior of space and time in different inertial frames of reference. The theory of special relativity is a theory that describes the
behavior of space and time in different inertial frames of reference.
