## Introduction to Physics and Its Branches

- Physics is the scientific study of matter, energy, and their interactions
- Branches of physics include:
  - Mechanics: study of motion and forces
  - Thermodynamics: study of heat and temperature  
  - Electromagnetism: study of electricity and magnetism
  - Optics: study of light and vision
  - Nuclear physics: study of atomic nuclei and subatomic particles
  - Quantum mechanics: study of matter and energy at the atomic scale
- Physics forms the foundation for other sciences like chemistry and biology
- Applications of physics are found in technology, engineering, and everyday life

## SI Units and Measurement 

- SI (Système International) is the standard system of measurement used in science
- Seven base SI units:
  1. Length: meter (m)
  2. Mass: kilogram (kg)  
  3. Time: second (s)
  4. Electric current: ampere (A)
  5. Temperature: kelvin (K)
  6. Amount of substance: mole (mol)
  7. Luminous intensity: candela (cd)
- Prefixes are used to denote multiples and fractions of units:
  - kilo- (k): 1000
  - centi- (c): 1/100  
  - milli- (m): 1/1000
  - micro- (μ): 1/1,000,000
- Derived units are formed by combining base units (e.g. velocity = m/s)

## Dimensional Analysis and Unit Conversions

- Dimensional analysis: technique for converting between units
- Steps for unit conversion:
  1. Identify starting and desired units
  2. Set up conversion factors to cancel out unwanted units
  3. Multiply all factors and units
  4. Cancel out units and calculate final answer
- Example: Convert 65 mph to m/s
  65 mi/hr * (1609 m / 1 mi) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 29.1 m/s
- Always check that final units are correct

# Discussion Questions

1. Why is it important to have standardized units of measurement in science? What problems could arise without them?

2. How does physics relate to other scientific fields like chemistry or biology? Can you think of any examples where physics concepts are applied in those fields?

3. What are some examples of how physics is used in everyday technology or objects around us? 

4. Why do you think the SI system uses base units and derived units? What are the advantages of this approach?

5. How might unit conversions and dimensional analysis be useful in real-world scenarios outside of physics class?

6. What are some traditional units of measurement used in Timor-Leste? How do they compare to SI units?

# Writing Exercise 

Write a 1-2 paragraph explanation of how physics relates to a career or industry that interests you. Some questions to consider:
- What physics concepts or principles are relevant to that field? 
- How is physics knowledge applied practically?
- Why is understanding physics important for professionals in that area?

Be sure to use clear topic sentences, specific examples, and proper paragraph structure in your response.

# Assignments

1. Measure 5 objects in your home or community using both traditional Timorese units and SI units. Create a table showing your measurements and the conversion between the two systems.

2. Research one branch of physics not covered in the lecture (e.g. astrophysics, biophysics, geophysics). Write a 1-page summary explaining:
   - The main focus of that branch
   - 2-3 key topics or concepts it covers
   - Real-world applications or technologies that have resulted from research in that area

3. Complete the following unit conversions:
   a) 5.8 km to m
   b) 250 g to kg  
   c) 72 km/h to m/s
   d) 98.6°F to °C
   e) 1.5 hours to seconds

4. Create an informational poster about a physics application or technology used in Timor-Leste. Include:
   - A description of how it works using physics concepts
   - Labeled diagram or illustration
   - Its importance/impact on daily life or the economy
