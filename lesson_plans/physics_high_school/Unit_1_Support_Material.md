Here is some support material for the lesson plan on Introduction to Physics and SI Units:

# Support Material

## 1. Key Vocabulary List

- Physics: The scientific study of matter, energy, and their interactions
- SI units: The International System of Units, a standardized system of measurement used in science
- Meter: The SI base unit of length
- Kilogram: The SI base unit of mass  
- Second: The SI base unit of time
- Prefix: A unit modifier that indicates a multiple or fraction of the base unit (e.g., kilo-, milli-)
- Dimensional analysis: A technique for converting between different units of measurement
- Estimation: Making an approximate calculation or judgment of a value
- Standardization: The process of implementing and developing technical standards

## 2. Visual Aids

Diagram 1: SI Base Units
[Text description: A circular diagram showing the 7 SI base units - meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela - arranged around a central circle labeled "SI Base Units"]

Diagram 2: Common SI Prefixes 
[Text description: A table showing common SI prefixes, their symbols, and their numerical values. Includes kilo- (k, 10^3), centi- (c, 10^-2), milli- (m, 10^-3), micro- (Î¼, 10^-6), etc.]

## 3. Handouts

Worksheet 1: Unit Conversion Practice
- 10 problems converting between different metric units (e.g., km to m, g to kg)
- 5 problems converting between traditional Timorese units and SI units
- Answer key provided separately

Handout 1: Physics in Everyday Life
- List of 10 examples of physics applications in Timor-Leste, with brief explanations
- Blank spaces for students to add their own examples

## 4. Additional Resources

1. "The Story of Physics" - Brief illustrated history of major physics discoveries
2. "SI Units: A Guide for Beginners" - Online tutorial with interactive exercises
3. "Physics in Timor-Leste" - Collection of articles on local physics applications
4. Video: "Why We Need Standard Units" - Short educational video (5 minutes)

## 5. Tips for Teachers

Potential challenges and solutions:

1. Students struggling with unit conversions
   - Provide step-by-step examples on the board
   - Use dimensional analysis method consistently
   - Offer extra practice problems for homework

2. Difficulty relating physics to everyday life
   - Start each class with a "Physics in Action" example from Timor-Leste
   - Encourage students to share their own observations
   - Organize a field trip to observe physics principles in local context

3. Language barriers with scientific terms
   - Create a word wall with key terms in both English and Tetum
   - Use visual aids and demonstrations whenever possible
   - Provide a glossary of terms for students to reference

4. Limited access to measurement tools
   - Improvise with everyday objects (e.g., use rice grains for mass, hand spans for length)
   - Rotate shared equipment among small groups
   - Assign some measurements as take-home activities

5. Misconceptions about the nature of physics
   - Address common myths explicitly
   - Emphasize the process of scientific inquiry, not just facts
   - Showcase diverse physicists and their contributions to society
