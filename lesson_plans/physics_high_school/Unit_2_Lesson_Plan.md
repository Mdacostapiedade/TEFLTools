INTRODUCTIONCHAPTER 10Special Relativity
10.1 Postulates of Special Relativity
10.2 Consequences of Special Relativity
The theory of special relativity was proposed in 1905 by Albert Einstein in his article "On the
Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies." The theory includes two postulates:
1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.
2. The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or the motion of the light
source.
This theory was constructed by Einstein to resolve incompatibilities between the laws of electromagnetism and the laws of
classical mechanics. It introduced major changes to the notion of absolute time and space. In classical mechanics, the time
interval between two events is independent of the motion of the observer measuring the time. Special relativity postulates that
the time interval between two events depends on the motion of the observer. In classical mechanics, the distance between two
points is independent of the observer's motion. Special relativity postulates that distances appear to be contracted along the
direction of motion of an observer moving relative to the observed object.
In this chapter, we will study the postulates of special relativity and their consequences.

Postulates of Special Relativity
The theory of special relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in 1905. It was constructed on the foundation of Galileo's and
Newton's work. The theory is special because it only applies to the special case of inertial reference frames. An inertial frame of
reference is one in which Newton's first law is valid. That is, an object at rest remains at rest and an object in motion remains in
motion at constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force. The surface of Earth is nearly an inertial frame of
reference. The surface of Earth is not a perfect inertial frame of reference because Earth rotates and revolves around the sun.
However, the surface of Earth is close enough to an inertial frame of reference that we can use it as one for most purposes.
The theory of special relativity is based on two postulates:
1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.
2. The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or the motion of the light
source.
The first postulate is a generalization of classical relativity. Classical relativity is the principle that the laws of mechanics are the
same in all inertial frames of reference. The first postulate of special relativity extends this principle to all laws of physics,
including the laws of electromagnetism. The second postulate is a new idea that was not part of classical relativity. It is based on
the observation that the speed of light in vacuum is always measured to be the same value, regardless of the motion of the
observer or the motion of the light source.
The postulates of special relativity lead to some counterintuitive phenomena. For example, the postulates of special relativity
lead to the conclusion that simultaneity is relative. That is, two events that are simultaneous in one frame of reference may not
be simultaneous in another frame of reference. The postulates of special relativity also lead to the conclusion that time dilation
and length contraction occur. Time dilation is the phenomenon in which time appears to pass more slowly for a moving object
than for a stationary object. Length contraction is the phenomenon in which the length of an object appears to be shorter in the
direction of motion than it is when the object is at rest.

Time Dilation and Length Contraction
The postulates of special relativity lead to some counterintuitive phenomena. One of these phenomena is time dilation. Time
dilation is the phenomenon in which time appears to pass more slowly for a moving object than for a stationary object. The time
interval between two events in the frame of reference in which the events occur at the same location is called the proper time.
The proper time is the shortest time interval between two events. The time interval between two events in a frame of reference
in which the events occur at different locations is longer than the proper time. The time interval between two events in a frame
of reference in which the events
