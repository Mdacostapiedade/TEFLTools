## One-Dimensional Motion

### Displacement
- Vector quantity representing change in position
- Has magnitude and direction
- Formula: Δx = x_f - x_i

### Velocity  
- Rate of change of position with respect to time
- Average velocity: v_avg = Δx / Δt
- Instantaneous velocity: v = lim(Δt→0) Δx / Δt

### Acceleration
- Rate of change of velocity with respect to time  
- Average acceleration: a_avg = Δv / Δt
- Instantaneous acceleration: a = lim(Δt→0) Δv / Δt

### Kinematic Equations (constant acceleration)
1. v = v_0 + at
2. x = x_0 + v_0t + (1/2)at^2  
3. v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0)

## Two-Dimensional Motion

### Vectors
- Quantities with magnitude and direction
- Can be represented by arrows or components (x,y)
- Vector addition: tip-to-tail method or component-wise

### Projectile Motion
- Combination of horizontal and vertical motion
- Horizontal motion: constant velocity (no acceleration)
- Vertical motion: constant acceleration due to gravity
- x = x_0 + v_0x * t
- y = y_0 + v_0y * t - (1/2)gt^2

### Relative Motion  
- Motion described relative to a moving reference frame
- v_rel = v_obj - v_ref

# Discussion Questions

1. How is displacement different from distance traveled? Give an example.

2. A car accelerates from rest to 60 km/h in 8 seconds. Describe its motion and calculate its acceleration.

3. You throw a ball straight up in the air. Describe its velocity and acceleration at different points in its trajectory.

4. How do vectors allow us to analyze motion in two dimensions? What are some advantages of using vector components?

5. A boat is traveling east at 5 m/s relative to the water in a river that flows north at 3 m/s. What is the boat's velocity relative to the shore?

6. How does air resistance affect projectile motion in the real world compared to the idealized case we studied?

# Writing Exercise

Write a 1-2 page explanation of the concept of acceleration for a middle school student. Use analogies, diagrams, and everyday examples to illustrate the concept. Be sure to distinguish between velocity and acceleration.

# Assignment 

Design and describe an experiment to measure the acceleration due to gravity (g) in Timor-Leste. Your description should include:

1. A detailed experimental setup and procedure
2. The kinematic equations you will use to analyze the data
3. At least 3 potential sources of error and how you would minimize them
4. A prediction of whether your measured value might differ from the standard 9.8 m/s^2, and why

Your write-up should be 2-3 pages, including any diagrams or equations.
