Here is some support material for the lesson on Motion in One and Two Dimensions:

# Support Material: Motion in One and Two Dimensions

## 1. Key Vocabulary List

- Displacement: The change in position of an object, including direction
- Velocity: The rate of change of position with respect to time 
- Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity with respect to time
- Vector: A quantity that has both magnitude and direction
- Scalar: A quantity that has only magnitude
- Projectile: An object launched into the air subject only to the force of gravity and air resistance
- Kinematics: The branch of mechanics dealing with motion without regard to the forces causing it
- Trajectory: The path followed by a projectile moving under the influence of gravity
- Frame of reference: A coordinate system used to represent and measure properties of objects
- Relative motion: The motion of an object as observed from a particular frame of reference

## 2. Visual Aids

Diagram 1: Position-Time Graph
[Description: A graph with time on the x-axis and position on the y-axis. Show three lines:
1) A horizontal line representing an object at rest
2) A straight diagonal line representing constant velocity
3) A curved line representing acceleration]

Diagram 2: Projectile Motion Trajectory  
[Description: A parabolic arc showing the path of a projectile. Label the initial velocity vector, horizontal and vertical components, and the forces acting on the projectile (gravity and air resistance)]

Diagram 3: Vector Addition
[Description: Two vectors A and B shown as arrows. Show their sum A+B using the tip-to-tail method and the parallelogram method]

## 3. Handouts/Worksheets

Worksheet 1: Interpreting Motion Graphs
- Provide 3-4 position-time and velocity-time graphs
- Ask students to describe the motion represented (e.g. constant velocity, acceleration, at rest)
- Have students calculate displacement, velocity, and acceleration from the graphs

Worksheet 2: Projectile Motion Problems
- Present 3-4 word problems involving projectile motion in local contexts (e.g. coconut falling from a tree, ball kicked on a soccer field)
- Students should sketch the trajectory, identify known quantities, select appropriate equations, and solve for unknowns

## 4. Additional Resources

1. "Physlet Physics" by Wolfgang Christian and Mario Belloni - interactive physics simulations
2. "Khan Academy Physics" - free online video lessons and practice problems
3. "The Physics Classroom" website - tutorials and problem-solving guides
4. "Tracker" video analysis software - free tool for analyzing motion in videos

## 5. Teaching Tips

Potential challenges and solutions:

1. Vector concepts:
   - Use physical demonstrations with ropes or arrows on the floor
   - Relate to real-life examples like navigation or wind direction

2. Graph interpretation:
   - Start with plotting students' own motion before abstract graphs
   - Use motion sensors or smartphone apps for real-time graphing

3. Projectile motion:
   - Begin with horizontal projectiles before angled launches
   - Use slow-motion video analysis of real projectiles

4. Mathematical difficulties:
   - Review necessary math skills before introducing physics formulas
   - Emphasize conceptual understanding alongside calculations

5. Relating to daily life:
   - Ask students to identify examples of different types of motion in their community
   - Discuss applications like sports, transportation, and traditional practices

Remember to adapt examples and contexts to be relevant to students' experiences in Timor-Leste.
