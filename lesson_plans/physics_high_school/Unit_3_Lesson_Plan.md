# Lesson Plan: Forces and Newton's Laws of Motion

## 1. Resources Needed
- Textbook
- Whiteboard and markers
- Spring scales
- Various objects of different masses
- Smooth and rough surfaces (e.g. wooden board, sandpaper)
- Rope or string
- Pulleys
- Locally available materials for simple machine design (e.g. bamboo, wood, rocks)

## 2. Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- State and explain Newton's three laws of motion
- Identify and describe different types of forces
- Draw and interpret free-body diagrams
- Apply Newton's laws to analyze real-world situations in Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Divide students into pairs
- Each pair tries to push a heavy object (e.g. desk) across the room
- Discuss observations: Why was it difficult to start moving? Why did it keep moving once started?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)
- Write key terms on the board: force, mass, acceleration, inertia, friction, tension, normal force
- Have students guess meanings based on the warm-up activity
- Provide simple definitions and examples for each term

## 5. Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
- Present Newton's First Law of Motion
  * Explain concept of inertia with examples (e.g. passengers in a moving car)
- Introduce Newton's Second Law of Motion
  * Demonstrate F = ma using spring scales and objects of different masses
- Explain Newton's Third Law of Motion
  * Use examples like rocket propulsion, walking, swimming
- Discuss types of forces:
  * Friction: Demonstrate using different surfaces
  * Tension: Show with rope and pulley system
  * Normal force: Explain using objects on a table

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)
- In small groups, students identify forces acting on various objects in the classroom
- Draw free-body diagrams for these situations
- Calculate net force and predicted acceleration for simple scenarios

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)
- In groups, students design a simple machine to solve a local problem in Timor-Leste
  * Examples: Water lifting device, load-carrying aid for farmers
- Apply Newton's laws to explain how the machine works
- Draw free-body diagrams for key components of the machine

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
- Each group briefly presents their simple machine design
- Class votes on most innovative and practical design
- Quick quiz: True/false questions on Newton's laws and forces

## 9. Homework Assignment
- Research traditional Timorese tools or techniques that demonstrate Newton's laws
- Write a short report explaining the physics principles involved
- Sketch free-body diagrams for the chosen tool/technique

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Force: A push or pull acting on an object
- Mass: The amount of matter in an object
- Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity
- Inertia: The tendency of an object to resist changes in its motion
- Friction: Force that opposes motion between surfaces that are in contact
- Tension: Force transmitted through a string, rope, cable or wire when it is pulled tight
- Normal force: The force exerted by a surface on an object that is in contact with it
