## Newton's Laws of Motion

### First Law of Motion
- An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
- This law is often called the law of inertia.
- Examples:
  * A book on a table remains at rest unless a force acts on it.
  * Passengers in a car tend to continue moving forward when the car suddenly stops.

### Second Law of Motion
- The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
- Mathematically expressed as F = ma
  * F is the net force
  * m is the mass of the object
  * a is the acceleration
- Examples:
  * A small force applied to a light object produces a large acceleration.
  * A large force applied to a heavy object produces a small acceleration.

### Third Law of Motion
- For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
- Forces always occur in pairs.
- Examples:
  * A swimmer pushing water backwards (action) is pushed forward by the water (reaction).
  * A rocket expelling gas downwards (action) is propelled upwards (reaction).

## Types of Forces

### Friction
- Force that opposes the relative motion of objects in contact.
- Types:
  * Static friction: Prevents objects from starting to move.
  * Kinetic friction: Acts on objects already in motion.
- Factors affecting friction:
  * Nature of surfaces in contact
  * Normal force between surfaces
- Examples in Timor-Leste:
  * Friction between tires and road surfaces
  * Friction in traditional weaving techniques

### Tension
- Force transmitted through a string, rope, or cable when it is pulled tight.
- Always pulls away from the object it acts on.
- Examples:
  * Tension in a rope used to pull a cart
  * Tension in fishing lines used by Timorese fishermen

### Normal Force
- Force exerted by a surface on an object that is in contact with it.
- Acts perpendicular to the surface.
- Examples:
  * Normal force from a table supporting a book
  * Normal force from the ground supporting a person standing

## Free-body Diagrams
- Visual representations of all forces acting on an object
- Steps to create:
  1. Draw a simple shape to represent the object
  2. Identify all forces acting on the object
  3. Draw arrows to represent each force
  4. Label each force with its type and magnitude (if known)
- Importance:
  * Helps visualize and analyze forces in complex situations
  * Essential for solving problems involving Newton's laws

# Assignment Details

## Friction Investigation

1. Collect at least five different surfaces commonly found in Timor-Leste (e.g., wood, concrete, woven mat, smooth stone, rough stone).
2. Design an experiment to measure the coefficient of friction for each surface:
   - Use a small object of known mass
   - Create an inclined plane with the surface material
   - Measure the angle at which the object begins to slide
3. Calculate the coefficient of friction for each surface using the formula: μ = tan(θ)
4. Present your results in a table and a bar graph
5. Write a short report (300-400 words) discussing:
   - Your experimental method
   - The results and their implications
   - Potential applications of this knowledge in Timor-Leste (e.g., road design, shoe manufacturing)

## Simple Machine Design Project

1. Identify a common problem in Timor-Leste that could be addressed with a simple machine (e.g., water transportation, crop processing, construction).
2. Design a simple machine to address this problem, incorporating at least two of Newton's Laws of Motion.
3. Create a detailed sketch of your design, including labels for key components.
4. Draw free-body diagrams for the critical parts of your machine, showing all relevant forces.
5. Write a 500-word report explaining:

   - Challenges that might arise in implementing your design

6. Prepare a 5-minute presentation to share your design with the class.

# Additional Materials

## Local Case Study: Tais Weaving and Newton's Laws

Tais, the traditional woven fabric of Timor-Leste, provides an excellent example of Newton's Laws and forces in action:

1. First Law (Inertia): The loom's beater bar remains at rest until the weaver applies force to it.

2. Second Law (F = ma): The force applied by the weaver to the beater bar determines how quickly it accelerates and how tightly the weft threads are packed.

3. Third Law (Action-Reaction): As the weaver pulls on the warp threads, the threads exert an equal and opposite force back on the weaver's hands.

4. Tension: The warp threads must be kept under constant tension for successful weaving.

5. Friction: The friction between warp and weft threads helps hold the fabric together.

Students can analyze the tais weaving process to identify these physics principles in action and consider how understanding these concepts might lead to innovations in the weaving process or loom design.

## Practical Demonstration: Newton's Cradle

Create a simple Newton's Cradle using local materials:
- Bamboo frame
- Fishing line
- Small, hard fruits or stones of equal mass

Use this to demonstrate:
- Conservation of momentum
- Newton's Third Law
- Energy transfer

Encourage students to explain the physics behind the Newton's Cradle and brainstorm potential applications of this principle in Timorese contexts.
