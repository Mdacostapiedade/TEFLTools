Here is some support material for the Work, Energy, and Power lesson plan, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material: Work, Energy, and Power in Timor-Leste

## 1. Key Vocabulary List

- Work: The transfer of energy when a force acts on an object to cause a displacement
- Energy: The capacity to do work
- Kinetic Energy: The energy an object possesses due to its motion
- Potential Energy: Stored energy an object has due to its position or configuration
- Power: The rate at which work is done or energy is transferred
- Joule: The SI unit of energy and work (1 J = 1 N * m)
- Watt: The SI unit of power (1 W = 1 J / s)
- Conservation of Energy: The principle that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another

## 2. Visual Aids/Diagrams

1. Energy Transformations Diagram:
   - Description: A flowchart showing energy transformations in a simple machine (e.g., a water wheel used in traditional Timorese agriculture). The diagram should illustrate the conversion of gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy to mechanical work.

2. Work-Energy Theorem Illustration:
   - Description: A visual representation of the work-energy theorem, showing a force applied to an object and the resulting change in kinetic energy. Include labels for initial and final velocities, displacement, and the work done.

3. Power Comparison Chart:
   - Description: A bar graph comparing the power output of various common activities in Timor-Leste (e.g., human walking, running, a small motor, a car engine). Use local examples where possible.

## 3. Handouts/Worksheets

1. Energy Calculations Worksheet:
   - Content: Problems involving calculations of work, kinetic energy, potential energy, and power. Include scenarios relevant to Timor-Leste, such as:
     * Calculating the work done in carrying water up a hill
     * Determining the kinetic energy of a traditional spinning top
     * Finding the power output of a person climbing stairs

2. Energy Transformations in Timorese Agriculture:
   - Content: A table for students to fill out, identifying energy transformations in various agricultural activities (e.g., plowing, irrigation, harvesting). Students should list the initial form of energy, the final form, and any intermediate transformations.

3. Conservation of Energy Practice:
   - Content: Problems applying the principle of conservation of energy to situations like:
     * A coconut falling from a tree
     * A simple pendulum made from local materials
     * A person sliding down a hillside

## 4. Additional Resources

1. "Energy in Everyday Life" - A locally produced booklet highlighting energy use and conservation in Timorese households and communities.

2. Online simulation: "Energy Skate Park" from PhET Interactive Simulations (if available in Tetum)
   Link: https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/energy-skate-park-basics

3. Video: "Renewable Energy in Timor-Leste" - A documentary on local renewable energy projects and their physics principles (if available)

4. Article: "Traditional Energy Systems in Timor-Leste" - A research paper discussing the physics behind traditional energy use in the country

## 5. Tips for Teachers

1. Contextualizing Content:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle to relate abstract physics concepts to their daily lives.
   - Solution: Consistently use local examples and encourage students to identify energy transformations in their own experiences.

2. Mathematical Difficulties:
   - Challenge: Some students may struggle with the mathematical aspects of energy calculations.
   - Solution: Provide step-by-step problem-solving guides and encourage peer tutoring. Use visual representations to support mathematical concepts.

3. Misconceptions about Energy:
   - Challenge: Students often have pre-existing misconceptions about energy (e.g., energy can be "used up").
   - Solution: Explicitly address common misconceptions and provide clear demonstrations of energy conservation.

4. Language Barriers:
   - Challenge: Physics terminology may be difficult in both English and Tetum.
   - Solution: Create a bilingual vocabulary wall in the classroom and consistently use both languages in instruction.

5. Limited Resources:
   - Challenge: Schools may lack advanced laboratory equipment for energy experiments.
   - Solution: Design experiments using locally available materials and emphasize qualitative understanding alongside quantitative measurements.
