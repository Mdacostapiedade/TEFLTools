## Rotational Kinematics

### Angular Velocity and Acceleration

Angular velocity (ω) is the rate of change of angular position with respect to time. It is measured in radians per second (rad/s).

ω = Δθ / Δt

Where:
- Δθ is the change in angular position
- Δt is the time interval

Angular acceleration (α) is the rate of change of angular velocity with respect to time. It is measured in radians per second squared (rad/s²).

α = Δω / Δt

Where:
- Δω is the change in angular velocity
- Δt is the time interval

### Relationship between Linear and Angular Quantities

For an object moving in a circular path:
- v = rω (linear velocity = radius × angular velocity)
- a = rα (tangential acceleration = radius × angular acceleration)

## Rotational Dynamics

### Torque

Torque (τ) is the rotational equivalent of force. It causes angular acceleration and is calculated as:

τ = r × F

Where:
- r is the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the force
- F is the applied force

The SI unit of torque is Newton-meter (N·m).

### Rotational Inertia

Rotational inertia (I) is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotational motion. It depends on the mass distribution of the object relative to its axis of rotation.

For a point mass: I = mr²
For a solid disk: I = ½mr²
For a hollow cylinder: I = mr²

Where:
- m is the mass of the object
- r is the distance from the axis of rotation

### Newton's Second Law for Rotation

τ = Iα

This equation relates torque (τ) to rotational inertia (I) and angular acceleration (α), analogous to F = ma for linear motion.

## Gravitation and Kepler's Laws

### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

F = G(m₁m₂) / r²

Where:
- F is the gravitational force between two masses
- G is the gravitational constant (6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg²)
- m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the two objects
- r is the distance between the centers of the masses

### Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion

1. The orbit of each planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
2. A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
3. The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

T² = (4π² / GM) a³

Where:
- T is the orbital period
- G is the gravitational constant
- M is the mass of the central body
- a is the semi-major axis of the orbit

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the concept of rotational inertia apply to the spinning of a traditional Timorese top? How might changing the mass distribution of the top affect its spinning behavior?

2. Compare and contrast linear motion with rotational motion. How are concepts like velocity, acceleration, and force analogous in these two types of motion?

3. Kepler's laws were originally formulated for planetary motion. How do these laws apply to artificial satellites orbiting Earth? What factors might cause deviations from these laws for satellites?

4. How might understanding orbital mechanics be beneficial for Timor-Leste's development, particularly in areas such as communications or resource management?

5. Discuss the role of torque in everyday activities in Timor-Leste. Can you think of examples where people use the principle of torque, even if they don't realize it?
