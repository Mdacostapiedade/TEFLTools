Here's the support material for the lesson on Rotational Motion and Gravitation, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material: Rotational Motion and Gravitation

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Angular velocity (ω): The rate of change of angular position with respect to time
- Angular acceleration (α): The rate of change of angular velocity with respect to time
- Torque (τ): The rotational equivalent of force, causing angular acceleration
- Rotational inertia (I): A measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotational motion
- Orbital period (T): The time taken for an object to complete one orbit around another body
- Eccentricity (e): A measure of how much an orbit deviates from a perfect circle
- Centripetal force: A force that acts on a body moving in a circular path and is directed toward the center around which the body is moving
- Moment of inertia: A quantity expressing a body's tendency to resist angular acceleration
- Precession: The slow movement of the axis of a spinning body around another axis
- Kepler's laws: Three fundamental laws describing the motion of planets around the sun

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with the concept of angular quantities
   Tip: Use analogies between linear and angular motion. For example, compare linear velocity to angular velocity using a bicycle wheel.

2. Challenge: Difficulty visualizing torque
   Tip: Provide hands-on demonstrations using everyday objects like door handles or wrenches to illustrate the concept of torque.

3. Challenge: Confusion about the relationship between rotational inertia and mass
   Tip: Use examples of objects with different mass distributions, such as a solid disk vs. a hoop, to demonstrate how rotational inertia depends on mass distribution.

4. Challenge: Students having trouble understanding Kepler's laws
   Tip: Use the PhET simulation to visually demonstrate each law and its effects on orbital motion.

5. Challenge: Difficulty relating abstract concepts to real-world applications
   Tip: Incorporate local examples and applications throughout the lesson, such as satellite communications in Timor-Leste or the motion of traditional spinning tops.

6. Challenge: Students struggling with mathematical calculations
   Tip: Provide step-by-step guides for solving problems and encourage peer tutoring during practice sessions.
