INTRODUCTIONCHAPTER 10Special Relativity
10.1 Postulates of Special Relativity
10.2 Consequences of Special Relativity
Relativity is a theory that describes the relationship between space and time. It was first proposed by Albert
Einstein in 1905. The theory of relativity has two parts: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity describes the
relationship between space and time for objects moving at constant velocity. General relativity describes the relationship
between space and time for objects that are accelerating. In this chapter, we will focus on special relativity.
Special relativity is based on two postulates: (1) the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames, and (2) the speed
of light in a vacuum is constant in all inertial reference frames. These postulates lead to some surprising consequences, such as
time dilation and length contraction. We will explore these consequences in this chapter.

Postulates of Special Relativity
Special relativity is a theory proposed by Albert Einstein that describes the propagation of matter and light at high speeds. It was
conceived by Einstein in 1905. The theory has several consequences that clearly demonstrate that our intuitions about space and
time are not correct. This theory is "special" because it only applies to the special case of inertial reference frames, which are
frames of reference that are not accelerating. A reference frame is a coordinate system in which the position and motion of an
object can be described. An inertial reference frame is one in which Newton's first law of motion is valid. That is, an object at rest
remains at rest and an object in motion remains in motion with constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force.
The theory is based on two postulates. A postulate is a statement that is assumed to be true without proof. The postulates of
special relativity are as follows:
1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.
2. The speed of light in a vacuum is constant in all inertial reference frames.
The first postulate is not that surprising. It is a restatement of the idea that the laws of physics are the same everywhere. The
second postulate is the surprising one. It says that the speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames. This means that
if you are moving toward or away from a light source, you will measure the same speed for the light coming from that source.
This is very different from our everyday experience with moving objects.
For example, if you are in a car moving at 60 mph and you throw a ball forward at 30 mph, the ball will be moving at 90 mph
relative to the ground. If you throw the ball backward at 30 mph, it will be moving at 30 mph relative to the ground. But if you
shine a flashlight forward or backward, the light will always move at the speed of light relative to the ground. This is a very
strange idea, but it has been confirmed by many experiments.
The Michelson-Morley Experiment
The Michelson-Morley experiment was an attempt to detect the motion of Earth through a substance called the ether. The ether
was thought to be a substance that filled all of space and provided a medium for light to travel through. The experiment was
performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887.
The experiment was based on the idea that if Earth were moving through the ether, the speed of light would be different in
different directions. The experiment used an interferometer to measure the speed of light in different directions. An
interferometer is a device that splits a beam of light into two perpendicular beams and then recombines them. If the speed of
light were different in different directions, the recombined beams would interfere with each other and produce a pattern of light
and dark bands.
The experiment was performed many times over the course of a year. The Earth's motion around the sun would cause its motion
through the ether to change direction. However, no interference pattern was ever observed. This meant that the speed of light
was the same in all directions.
The results of the Michelson-Morley experiment were very surprising. They showed that there was no ether and that the speed of
light was constant in all directions. This led to the development of special relativity.
