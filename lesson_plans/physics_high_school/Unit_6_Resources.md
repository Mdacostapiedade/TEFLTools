## Wave Properties and Behavior

- Waves are disturbances that propagate through a medium, transferring energy without transferring matter
- Key properties of waves:
  - Wavelength: distance between adjacent crests or troughs 
  - Frequency: number of waves passing a fixed point per second
  - Amplitude: maximum displacement from equilibrium
  - Speed: wavelength * frequency
- Types of waves:
  - Mechanical waves (require a medium): e.g. sound, water waves
  - Electromagnetic waves (can travel through vacuum): e.g. light, radio waves
- Wave behaviors:
  - Reflection: change in direction when wave hits a boundary
  - Refraction: change in direction when wave enters a new medium
  - Diffraction: bending of waves around obstacles
  - Interference: superposition of multiple waves

## Sound Waves and Acoustics

- Sound waves are longitudinal pressure waves that travel through a medium
- Speed of sound depends on the medium (faster in solids than liquids or gases)
- Characteristics of sound:
  - Pitch: determined by frequency 
  - Loudness: determined by amplitude
  - Timbre: determined by overtones/harmonics
- Resonance: increased amplitude at natural frequencies
- Doppler effect: apparent change in frequency due to relative motion
- Applications in music:
  - Standing waves in musical instruments
  - Harmonics and overtones create unique timbres

## Reflection, Refraction, and Lenses

- Law of reflection: angle of incidence = angle of reflection
- Refraction: bending of light as it passes between media
- Snell's Law: n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2 
- Total internal reflection occurs above the critical angle
- Types of lenses:
  - Converging (convex): thicker in middle, converges parallel rays
  - Diverging (concave): thinner in middle, diverges parallel rays
- Lens equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di
- Magnification: M = -di/do
- Applications:
  - Corrective lenses for vision
  - Cameras
  - Telescopes and microscopes

# Discussion Questions

1. How do the properties of waves explain phenomena we observe in everyday life, such as the colors in a soap bubble or the sound of a guitar string?

2. Compare and contrast mechanical and electromagnetic waves. How are their behaviors similar and different?

3. Explain how the Doppler effect works and give some real-world examples of where it can be observed.

4. How do lenses manipulate light to correct vision problems? Explain using ray diagrams.

5. Discuss some ways that understanding wave behavior and optics has led to technological advancements.

# Writing Exercise

Write a 1-2 page explanation of how a telescope works, incorporating concepts of reflection, refraction, and lenses. Include a diagram to illustrate the path of light through the telescope. Discuss both refracting and reflecting telescope designs.

# Assignment

## Wave Properties Lab

Materials needed:
- Ripple tank or large shallow pan
- Water
- Eyedropper 
- Ruler
- Stopwatch
- Various objects to create barriers/obstacles

Procedure:
1. Fill the ripple tank with about 1 cm of water
2. Use the eyedropper to create waves of different frequencies and amplitudes
3. Measure the wavelength, frequency, and speed of the waves
4. Observe and sketch wave behaviors like reflection, refraction, and diffraction as waves encounter barriers
5. Try creating interference patterns with multiple wave sources

Questions to answer:
1. How are wavelength, frequency, and wave speed related?
2. Describe and explain the wave behaviors you observed.
3. How did changing the frequency or amplitude affect the waves?
4. What real-world examples of these wave behaviors can you think of?
