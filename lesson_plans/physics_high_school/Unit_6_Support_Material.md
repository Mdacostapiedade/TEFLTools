Here is some suggested support material for the Waves and Optics lesson plan:

# Support Material for Waves and Optics Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List

- Wave: A disturbance that propagates through a medium, transferring energy without transferring matter
- Wavelength: The distance between two consecutive crests or troughs of a wave
- Frequency: The number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given time
- Amplitude: The maximum displacement of a wave from its equilibrium position
- Mechanical wave: A wave that requires a medium to propagate (e.g. sound waves)
- Electromagnetic wave: A wave that can propagate through a vacuum (e.g. light waves)
- Reflection: The change in direction of a wave at a boundary between two different media
- Refraction: The change in direction of a wave as it passes from one medium to another
- Diffraction: The bending of waves around obstacles or through openings
- Interference: The superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern
- Resonance: The tendency of a system to oscillate with greater amplitude at certain frequencies
- Optics: The branch of physics that deals with the behavior and properties of light
- Lens: A transparent optical device used to converge or diverge light rays
- Prism: A transparent optical element with flat, polished surfaces that refract light

## 5. Tips for Teachers

1. Potential Challenge: Students may struggle to visualize wave behavior.
   - Solution: Use physical demonstrations with springs, ropes, or ripple tanks to make wave concepts more tangible.

2. Potential Challenge: Difficulty understanding the dual nature of light as both a wave and a particle.
   - Solution: Introduce this concept gradually, focusing first on wave properties. Use analogies and historical context to explain how our understanding of light has evolved.

3. Potential Challenge: Applying mathematical concepts to wave problems.
   - Solution: Start with simple, conceptual problems before introducing more complex calculations. Use real-world examples to make the math more relevant.

4. Potential Challenge: Limited access to advanced optical equipment.
   - Solution: Utilize everyday objects (e.g., water glasses, mirrors) and smartphone apps (e.g., light meters, sound analyzers) to demonstrate optical principles.

5. Potential Challenge: Connecting wave and optics concepts to local context.
   - Solution: Incorporate examples from Timorese culture and environment, such as analyzing the acoustics of traditional instruments or discussing the optics of local natural phenomena (e.g., rainbows, mirages).
