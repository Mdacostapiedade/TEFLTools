# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Earth System Science and Planetary Boundaries

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Printed handouts of Earth system diagrams
- Large paper sheets and colored markers for mind mapping activity
- Access to internet for research (if available)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define Earth system science and explain its importance
- Identify the main components of the Earth system and their interactions
- Describe the concept of the Anthropocene
- List and briefly explain the nine planetary boundaries
- Relate Earth system concepts to local environmental changes in Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to pair up and discuss for 2 minutes: "What environmental changes have you noticed in your local area over the past few years?"
- Have pairs share their observations with the class, noting key points on the whiteboard
- Briefly discuss how these local changes might be connected to larger global processes

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Earth system
- Biosphere
- Anthropocene
- Planetary boundaries
- Resilience
- Tipping point

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

a) Introduction to Earth System Science
   - Definition and importance
   - Major components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, geosphere
   - Interactions and feedbacks between components

b) The Anthropocene
   - Definition and evidence
   - Human impacts on Earth systems

c) Planetary Boundaries Framework
   - Concept and purpose
   - Overview of the nine boundaries
   - Current status of boundaries

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

a) Earth System Components Matching Game
   - Provide students with cards containing Earth system components and their descriptions
   - Have them work in small groups to match components with their correct descriptions

b) Planetary Boundaries Quiz
   - Conduct a quick quiz using raised hands or digital tools (if available) to check understanding of the nine planetary boundaries

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

Mind Mapping Activity:
- Divide the class into small groups
- Provide each group with a large sheet of paper and colored markers
- Ask groups to create a mind map showing Earth system interactions relevant to Timor-Leste
- Encourage them to include local examples and connect them to global processes

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Have each group briefly present their mind maps
- Summarize key points from the lesson
- Address any remaining questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research one of the nine planetary boundaries and its specific relevance to Timor-Leste
- Write a one-page summary of findings, including potential local impacts and possible solutions

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Earth system: The interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes that transport and transform matter and energy within the planet
- Biosphere: The global sum of all ecosystems, including all living organisms and their interactions with the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere
- Anthropocene: A proposed geological epoch dating from the start of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems
- Planetary boundaries: A concept of nine Earth system processes which have boundaries that mark the safe zone for the planet
- Resilience: The capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks
- Tipping point: A critical threshold in an Earth system component, the exceeding of which may lead to a large and possibly irreversible change in the system
