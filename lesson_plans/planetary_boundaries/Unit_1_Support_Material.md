# Support Material for Introduction to Earth System Science and Planetary Boundaries

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Earth system**: The interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes that transport and transform matter and energy within the planet
- **Biosphere**: The global sum of all ecosystems, including all living organisms and their interactions with the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere
- **Anthropocene**: A proposed geological epoch dating from the start of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems
- **Planetary boundaries**: A concept of nine Earth system processes which have boundaries that mark the safe zone for the planet
- **Resilience**: The capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks
- **Tipping point**: A critical threshold in an Earth system component, the exceeding of which may lead to a large and possibly irreversible change in the system
- **Atmosphere**: The layer of gases surrounding the Earth
- **Hydrosphere**: All the water on Earth's surface, including oceans, rivers, lakes, and groundwater
- **Cryosphere**: The frozen parts of the Earth system, including ice sheets, glaciers, and sea ice
- **Geosphere**: The solid parts of the Earth, including rocks, sediments, and soils

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Earth System Components Diagram**: 
   A circular diagram showing the five main components of the Earth system (atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, geosphere) with arrows indicating interactions between them.

2. **Planetary Boundaries Infographic**: 
   A visual representation of the nine planetary boundaries, showing their current status (safe, increasing risk, high risk) using a traffic light color system (green, yellow, red).

3. **Anthropocene Timeline**: 
   A timeline showing key events and trends in human history that have contributed to the onset of the Anthropocene, including population growth, industrialization, and major technological advancements.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Earth System Components Matching Activity**: 
   A worksheet with two columns: one listing the Earth system components and another with their descriptions in random order. Students match the components to their correct descriptions.

2. **Planetary Boundaries Quiz**: 
   A multiple-choice quiz covering the nine planetary boundaries, their current status, and basic concepts related to each boundary.

3. **Mind Mapping Template**: 
   A large sheet with a central circle labeled "Earth System in Timor-Leste" and blank spaces around it for students to fill in during the mind mapping activity.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to grasp the interconnected nature of Earth systems.
   **Solution**: Use real-world examples relevant to Timor-Leste to illustrate connections. For instance, explain how deforestation affects local water cycles and biodiversity.

2. **Challenge**: The concept of planetary boundaries may seem abstract or disconnected from students' daily lives.
   **Solution**: Consistently relate global concepts to local issues in Timor-Leste. Use examples of how exceeding planetary boundaries affects local communities.

3. **Challenge**: Students may feel overwhelmed by the scale of global environmental issues.
   **Solution**: Emphasize the importance of local actions and provide examples of successful environmental initiatives in Timor-Leste or similar countries.

4. **Challenge**: Limited access to technology or internet for research or interactive activities.
   **Solution**: Prepare printed materials in advance and design activities that can be completed with basic supplies. Encourage group work to share resources.

5. **Challenge**: Varying levels of prior knowledge about environmental issues among students.
   **Solution**: Begin with a baseline assessment and use peer teaching strategies to leverage the knowledge of more advanced students while supporting those who need additional help.
