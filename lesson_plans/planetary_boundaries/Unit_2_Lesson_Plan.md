# Lesson Plan: Climate Change and Ocean Acidification

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with internet access
- Projector and screen
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on greenhouse effect and ocean acidification
- Carbon footprint calculators (online or printed worksheets)
- Field trip materials: notebooks, pens, cameras, water quality testing kits

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the greenhouse effect and its role in climate change
- Describe the process of ocean acidification and its causes
- Analyze the potential impacts of climate change on Timor-Leste's coastal communities
- Calculate and interpret their personal carbon footprint
- Identify and document evidence of climate change impacts in a coastal area

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show a series of before-and-after images of climate change impacts (e.g., coral bleaching, coastal erosion, extreme weather events)
- Ask students to discuss in pairs what they observe and what might be causing these changes

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and define key terms: greenhouse effect, carbon cycle, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, extreme weather events
- Use visual aids and simple diagrams to illustrate these concepts

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### The Greenhouse Effect and Carbon Cycle
- Explain the greenhouse effect using a diagram
- Discuss natural vs. anthropogenic greenhouse gases
- Outline the basic carbon cycle and human impacts on it

### Ocean Acidification
- Explain the chemistry of CO2 absorption by oceans
- Discuss the impacts on marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs

### Climate Change Impacts on Timor-Leste
- Present data on observed and projected changes in:
  - Sea-level rise
  - Extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, droughts)
  - Coastal erosion
  - Changes in fish populations

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Divide class into small groups to work on climate change impact scenarios for Timor-Leste
- Each group analyzes a different sector (e.g., agriculture, fisheries, water resources) and presents their findings to the class

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

### Carbon Footprint Calculation
- Guide students through calculating their personal carbon footprints using online calculators
- Discuss results and brainstorm ways to reduce individual carbon emissions

### Preparation for Field Trip
- Explain the objectives of the coastal field trip
- Teach basic observation and documentation techniques
- Assign roles and responsibilities for the field work

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Conduct a quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Address any questions or misconceptions
- Preview the upcoming field trip and its connection to the lesson content

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a short report on a specific climate change impact relevant to Timor-Leste (e.g., coral bleaching, mangrove loss, changes in agricultural productivity)
- Prepare necessary materials and clothing for the field trip

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Greenhouse effect: The warming of Earth's surface due to the trapping of heat by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
- Carbon cycle: The biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth
- Ocean acidification: The ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans, caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
- Sea-level rise: An increase in the level of the world's oceans due to the effects of global warming
- Extreme weather events: Unusual, severe or unseasonal weather at the extremes of the historical distribution
