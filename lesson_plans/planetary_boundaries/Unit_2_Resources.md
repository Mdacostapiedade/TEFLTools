# Lecture Notes

## The Greenhouse Effect and Carbon Cycle

### Introduction to the Greenhouse Effect
- Definition: The warming of Earth's surface due to the trapping of heat by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
- Natural vs. enhanced greenhouse effect
- Key greenhouse gases: CO2, methane, water vapor, nitrous oxide

### Mechanism of the Greenhouse Effect
1. Solar radiation passes through the atmosphere
2. Earth's surface absorbs some radiation and reflects the rest as infrared radiation
3. Greenhouse gases trap some of this infrared radiation
4. Trapped heat warms the lower atmosphere and Earth's surface

### The Carbon Cycle
- Definition: The biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth
- Key components:
  - Atmosphere
  - Terrestrial biosphere (plants and soil)
  - Oceans
  - Geological reservoirs (fossil fuels, sedimentary rocks)

### Human Impacts on the Carbon Cycle
- Burning of fossil fuels
- Deforestation and land-use changes
- Industrial processes
- Agriculture and livestock

## Ocean Acidification

### Chemistry of Ocean Acidification
- CO2 absorption by seawater
- Chemical equation: CO2 + H2O ⇌ H2CO3 ⇌ H+ + HCO3-
- Decrease in seawater pH

### Impacts on Marine Ecosystems
- Reduced calcification rates in marine organisms
- Effects on coral reefs:
  - Weakened coral structures
  - Reduced growth rates
  - Increased susceptibility to bleaching
- Impacts on shellfish and other calcifying organisms
- Potential disruptions to marine food webs

### Relevance to Timor-Leste
- Importance of coral reefs for coastal protection and fisheries
- Potential impacts on local marine biodiversity
- Implications for fishing communities and tourism

## Climate Change Impacts on Timor-Leste

### Sea-Level Rise
- Global projections and local observations
- Impacts on coastal communities and infrastructure
- Saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers

### Extreme Weather Events
- Changes in rainfall patterns
- Increased frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones
- Drought risks and impacts on agriculture

### Coastal Erosion
- Factors contributing to coastal erosion
- Observed changes in Timor-Leste's coastline
- Implications for coastal communities and ecosystems

### Changes in Fish Populations
- Shifts in species distribution due to changing ocean temperatures
- Impacts on coral reef ecosystems and associated fisheries
- Potential socio-economic consequences for fishing communities

# Discussion Questions

1. How might the enhanced greenhouse effect impact Timor-Leste's agriculture and food security?
2. What are some potential adaptation strategies for coastal communities facing sea-level rise in Timor-Leste?
3. How could ocean acidification affect Timor-Leste's marine-based economy, and what measures could be taken to mitigate these impacts?
4. Discuss the potential cascading effects of climate change on Timor-Leste's biodiversity, water resources, and human health.
5. How might traditional ecological knowledge in Timor-Leste contribute to climate change adaptation strategies?
6. What role can international cooperation play in addressing climate change impacts in Timor-Leste?
7. How can Timor-Leste balance economic development with climate change mitigation and adaptation?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. Analyze the potential long-term impacts of ocean acidification on Timor-Leste's coral reefs and propose strategies for their protection.
2. Discuss the challenges and opportunities for Timor-Leste in transitioning to renewable energy sources as a means of mitigating climate change.
3. Examine the role of mangrove forests in climate change adaptation for Timor-Leste's coastal communities and propose a conservation plan.

Your essay should include:
- An introduction stating the main argument or thesis
- At least three supporting paragraphs with evidence and examples
- A conclusion summarizing key points and suggesting future directions
- Proper citations of at least three reliable sources

# Assignment Details

## Carbon Footprint Analysis and Reduction Plan

1. Calculate your personal carbon footprint using an online calculator (e.g., WWF Footprint Calculator or Carbon Footprint Calculator).
2. Analyze your results, identifying the areas of your lifestyle that contribute most to your carbon footprint.
3. Develop a realistic plan to reduce your carbon footprint by at least 20% over the next year.
4. Write a 2-page report including:
   - Your initial carbon footprint calculation and analysis
   - Your reduction plan with specific, measurable actions
   - Potential challenges in implementing your plan and how you might overcome them
   - A reflection on how individual actions relate to broader climate change mitigation efforts

## Coastal Field Trip Report

1. During the field trip, document observations of potential climate change impacts, including:
   - Signs of coastal erosion
   - Changes in vegetation or wildlife
   - Evidence of extreme weather events
   - Human adaptations to environmental changes
2. Conduct basic water quality tests (if equipment is available)
3. Interview at least one local community member about observed environmental changes
4. Prepare a 3-page field report including:
   - Description of the study site and methods used
   - Summary of observations and data collected
   - Analysis of potential climate change impacts observed
   - Recommendations for further study or local adaptation measures
   - Reflections on the experience and its relevance to course concepts
