# Support Material for Climate Change and Ocean Acidification Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Greenhouse effect**: The warming of Earth's surface due to the trapping of heat by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
- **Carbon cycle**: The biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth
- **Ocean acidification**: The ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans, caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
- **Sea-level rise**: An increase in the level of the world's oceans due to the effects of global warming
- **Extreme weather events**: Unusual, severe or unseasonal weather at the extremes of the historical distribution
- **Carbon footprint**: The total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide (CO2)
- **Coral bleaching**: The process where corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn white
- **Coastal erosion**: The loss or displacement of land along the coastline due to the action of waves, currents, tides, wind-driven water, waterborne ice, or other impacts of storms

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Greenhouse Effect Diagram**: 
   - Show the Earth, atmosphere, and sun
   - Illustrate incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation
   - Depict greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trapping heat
   - Label key components: sun, Earth's surface, atmosphere, greenhouse gases

2. **Carbon Cycle Infographic**:
   - Illustrate carbon reservoirs: atmosphere, oceans, land biosphere, and geosphere
   - Show carbon fluxes between reservoirs with arrows
   - Include human activities affecting the cycle (e.g., fossil fuel burning, deforestation)

3. **Ocean Acidification Process**:
   - Depict CO2 being absorbed by the ocean surface
   - Show chemical equation: CO2 + H2O ⇌ H2CO3 ⇌ H+ + HCO3-
   - Illustrate pH scale with ocean pH shifting towards more acidic

4. **Climate Change Impacts on Timor-Leste Map**:
   - Outline map of Timor-Leste
   - Mark areas vulnerable to sea-level rise
   - Indicate regions prone to extreme weather events
   - Show changes in agricultural zones due to changing climate

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Greenhouse Effect Explanation**:
   - Step-by-step explanation of the greenhouse effect process
   - Comparison of natural vs. enhanced greenhouse effect
   - List of main greenhouse gases and their sources

2. **Ocean Acidification Fact Sheet**:
   - Definition and causes of ocean acidification
   - Effects on marine life, especially coral reefs and shellfish
   - Potential impacts on Timor-Leste's coastal ecosystems and fisheries

3. **Carbon Footprint Calculation Worksheet**:
   - Instructions for using online carbon footprint calculators
   - Table for recording personal energy use, transportation, diet, and consumption habits
   - Space for calculating total carbon footprint and comparing to national/global averages

4. **Climate Change Impact Scenario Analysis**:
   - Description of potential climate change scenarios for Timor-Leste
   - Questions prompting students to consider impacts on different sectors (agriculture, fisheries, water resources, etc.)
   - Space for brainstorming adaptation and mitigation strategies

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

- IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate
- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ocean Acidification Program website
- World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal for Timor-Leste
- United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Climate Change Adaptation portal
- NASA Global Climate Change website
- Local resources: Reports from Timor-Leste's National Directorate of Climate Change

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have misconceptions about climate change.
   **Solution**: Begin with a pre-assessment to identify misconceptions, then address them directly with scientific evidence.

2. **Challenge**: The topic can feel overwhelming or depressing.
   **Solution**: Balance discussion of impacts with positive examples of climate action and emphasize students' ability to make a difference.

3. **Challenge**: Limited local data on climate change impacts in Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Encourage students to collect and share their own observations, and use regional data when country-specific information is unavailable.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in visualizing long-term and global processes.
   **Solution**: Use analogies, simulations, and interactive visualizations to make abstract concepts more concrete.

5. **Challenge**: Varying levels of prior knowledge among students.
   **Solution**: Use differentiated instruction techniques, such as tiered assignments and flexible grouping, to accommodate different learning needs.

6. **Challenge**: Connecting global issues to local contexts.
   **Solution**: Consistently relate climate change concepts to Timor-Leste's environment and culture, using local examples and case studies whenever possible.
