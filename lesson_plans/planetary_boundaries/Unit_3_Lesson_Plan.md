# Lesson Plan: Biodiversity Loss and Land System Change in Timor-Leste

## Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts with local biodiversity information
- Field guides for local flora and fauna
- Binoculars and magnifying glasses
- Notebooks and writing materials
- Camera or smartphone for documentation
- Maps of Timor-Leste showing land use changes

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Define biodiversity and explain its importance
2. Identify major causes of biodiversity loss in Timor-Leste
3. Describe the impacts of land-use changes on local ecosystems
4. Conduct a basic biodiversity survey
5. Propose strategies for biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show students a series of images depicting Timor-Leste's diverse ecosystems (forests, coral reefs, mangroves, etc.)
- Ask students to identify as many different species as they can in each image
- Discuss: Why is this diversity important? How might it be threatened?

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Biodiversity
- Ecosystem
- Habitat fragmentation
- Deforestation
- Endemic species
- Conservation
- Sustainable land management

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduction to biodiversity
   - Definition and levels (genetic, species, ecosystem)
   - Importance for ecosystem services and human well-being

2. Biodiversity in Timor-Leste
   - Overview of key ecosystems and species
   - Endemic species and their significance

3. Causes of biodiversity loss
   - Habitat destruction and fragmentation
   - Overexploitation of resources
   - Climate change impacts
   - Invasive species

4. Land-use changes in Timor-Leste
   - Historical and current deforestation rates
   - Agricultural expansion and intensification
   - Urban development

5. Impacts of biodiversity loss and land-use changes
   - Ecosystem degradation
   - Loss of ecosystem services
   - Threats to food security and livelihoods

6. Conservation and sustainable land management strategies
   - Protected areas and their management
   - Community-based conservation initiatives
   - Sustainable agriculture practices

## Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Biodiversity Survey Simulation (25 minutes)
   - Divide students into small groups
   - Provide each group with a set of images or specimens representing a local ecosystem
   - Have students identify and record species, noting their characteristics and potential roles in the ecosystem
   - Groups present their findings, discussing the diversity observed and its importance

2. Land-use Change Analysis (20 minutes)
   - Provide students with maps or satellite images showing land-use changes in a specific area of Timor-Leste over time
   - Have students identify and quantify changes in forest cover, agricultural land, and urban areas
   - Discuss the potential impacts of these changes on local biodiversity and ecosystem services

## Production Task (30 minutes)

Community-based Conservation Project Proposal
- In small groups, students develop a brief proposal for a community-based conservation project addressing a specific biodiversity or land-use issue in Timor-Leste
- Proposals should include:
  * Problem statement
  * Project objectives
  * Key activities
  * Expected outcomes
  * Community involvement strategies
- Groups present their proposals to the class for feedback

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points about biodiversity loss and land-use change in Timor-Leste
- Discuss the most promising strategies for conservation and sustainable land management
- Reflect on the role of local communities in protecting biodiversity

## Homework Assignment

1. Biodiversity Journal:
   - Students keep a biodiversity journal for one week, recording observations of plants and animals in their local environment
   - Encourage students to research and identify unfamiliar species
   - Students should reflect on the diversity observed and any potential threats

2. Reading Assignment:
   - Provide a short article or report on a successful conservation project in Timor-Leste or a similar country
   - Students should summarize the project and its outcomes, and reflect on how similar approaches could be applied in their local area

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Biodiversity: The variety of life in a particular habitat or ecosystem, including the diversity of genes, species, and ecosystems
- Ecosystem: A community of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment
- Habitat fragmentation: The process by which a large, continuous area of habitat is divided into smaller, isolated patches
- Deforestation: The removal of a forest or stand of trees from land that is then converted to non-forest use
- Endemic species: Plants and animals that exist only in one geographic location
- Conservation: The protection, preservation, management, or restoration of natural environments and the ecological communities that inhabit them
- Sustainable land management: Practices that aim to integrate the management of land, water, biodiversity, and other environmental resources to meet human needs while maintaining ecosystem services for the long term
