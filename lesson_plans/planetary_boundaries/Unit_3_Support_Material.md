# Support Material for Biodiversity Loss and Land System Change Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Biodiversity**: The variety of life in a particular habitat or ecosystem, including the diversity of genes, species, and ecosystems.
- **Ecosystem**: A community of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment.
- **Habitat fragmentation**: The process by which a large, continuous area of habitat is divided into smaller, isolated patches.
- **Deforestation**: The removal of a forest or stand of trees from land that is then converted to non-forest use.
- **Endemic species**: Plants and animals that exist only in one geographic location.
- **Conservation**: The protection, preservation, management, or restoration of natural environments and the ecological communities that inhabit them.
- **Sustainable land management**: Practices that aim to integrate the management of land, water, biodiversity, and other environmental resources to meet human needs while maintaining ecosystem services for the long term.
- **Ecosystem services**: The benefits people obtain from ecosystems, such as food, water, timber, air purification, soil formation, and pollination.
- **Biodiversity hotspot**: A biogeographic region with significant levels of biodiversity that is threatened by human activities.
- **Invasive species**: A non-native species that has been introduced to an area and causes harm to the environment, economy, or human health.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Biodiversity Pyramid Diagram**: 
   A pyramid-shaped diagram illustrating the levels of biodiversity. At the base is genetic diversity, followed by species diversity in the middle, and ecosystem diversity at the top. Each level is labeled and includes brief explanations.

2. **Land-Use Change Map of Timor-Leste**:
   A series of three maps showing land use in Timor-Leste over time (e.g., 1990, 2005, 2020). The maps use color coding to represent different land uses such as forests, agricultural land, urban areas, and water bodies. A legend explains the color codes, and arrows or annotations highlight significant changes.

3. **Causes of Biodiversity Loss Infographic**:
   A circular infographic depicting the main causes of biodiversity loss. Each cause (e.g., habitat destruction, overexploitation, climate change, invasive species) is represented by an icon and brief description. Arrows show the interconnections between these causes.

4. **Ecosystem Services Illustration**:
   A landscape illustration showing various ecosystem services provided by a healthy forest ecosystem in Timor-Leste. Services such as water purification, carbon sequestration, soil retention, and habitat provision are labeled and visually represented within the landscape.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Biodiversity Survey Worksheet**:
   - Table for recording species observations (columns: species name, description, quantity, habitat)
   - Section for sketching or describing the survey area
   - Questions for reflection on the diversity observed and its importance
   - Space to note potential threats to biodiversity in the area

2. **Land-Use Change Analysis Worksheet**:
   - Two satellite images or maps of a specific area in Timor-Leste from different years
   - Table to record land-use types and their areas for each year
   - Questions to guide analysis of changes and their potential impacts
   - Space for students to propose sustainable land management strategies

3. **Community-based Conservation Project Proposal Template**:
   - Problem statement section
   - Project objectives checklist
   - Key activities brainstorming space
   - Expected outcomes table
   - Community involvement strategies section
   - Budget and timeline outline

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Limited local biodiversity knowledge**:
   - Prepare a local species guide with common flora and fauna
   - Invite local experts or elders to share traditional ecological knowledge
   - Encourage students to use smartphone apps for species identification

2. **Lack of access to field sites**:
   - Use virtual field trips or high-quality photographs if physical sites are inaccessible
   - Create a biodiversity garden on school grounds
   - Conduct surveys in urban parks or school surroundings

3. **Language barriers with scientific terms**:
   - Provide vocabulary lists with local language translations
   - Use visual aids and hands-on activities to reinforce concepts
   - Encourage students to create their own glossaries

4. **Limited resources for field equipment**:
   - Use smartphone apps for species identification and data collection
   - Create DIY equipment (e.g., simple quadrats using string and sticks)
   - Partner with local organizations or universities to borrow equipment

5. **Addressing sensitive land-use issues**:
   - Present balanced information from multiple perspectives
   - Focus on positive actions and solutions
   - Invite guest speakers from different stakeholder groups

6. **Engaging students with varying levels of environmental awareness**:
   - Use local examples and personal experiences to make the topic relevant
   - Incorporate hands-on activities and games to maintain interest
   - Assign differentiated tasks within group projects to accommodate different skill levels
