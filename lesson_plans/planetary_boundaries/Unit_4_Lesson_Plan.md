# Lesson Plan: Biogeochemical Flows - Nitrogen and Phosphorus Cycles

## Resources Needed

- Soil and water testing kits
- Microscopes
- Samples of different fertilizers
- Poster-making materials
- Computers with internet access
- Projector and screen

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain the natural nitrogen and phosphorus cycles
2. Describe how human activities have altered these cycles
3. Analyze the impacts of agricultural practices on nutrient flows in Timor-Leste
4. Propose sustainable agriculture practices to mitigate negative impacts

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

1. Display images of algal blooms and ask students what they think caused them
2. Briefly discuss the concept of eutrophication and its link to nutrient pollution

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Biogeochemical cycle
- Nitrogen fixation
- Denitrification
- Phosphorus weathering
- Eutrophication
- Fertilizer runoff

## Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Natural nitrogen cycle:
   - Atmospheric nitrogen fixation
   - Biological nitrogen fixation
   - Nitrification and denitrification
   - Plant uptake and decomposition

2. Natural phosphorus cycle:
   - Weathering of rocks
   - Uptake by plants
   - Decomposition and return to soil
   - Sedimentation in water bodies

3. Human impacts on nutrient cycles:
   - Industrial nitrogen fixation (Haber-Bosch process)
   - Phosphorus mining
   - Fertilizer use in agriculture
   - Wastewater and agricultural runoff

4. Consequences of altered nutrient cycles:
   - Eutrophication of water bodies
   - Soil degradation
   - Air and water pollution
   - Impacts on biodiversity

5. Timor-Leste context:
   - Current agricultural practices
   - Water pollution issues
   - Challenges in sustainable nutrient management

## Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Soil and water testing (20 minutes):
   - Divide students into groups
   - Provide soil and water samples from local agricultural areas
   - Guide students in testing for nitrogen and phosphorus levels
   - Discuss results and implications

2. Fertilizer analysis (20 minutes):
   - Provide different types of fertilizers used in Timor-Leste
   - Have students analyze nutrient content and potential environmental impacts
   - Discuss pros and cons of different fertilizer types

## Production Task (30 minutes)

Design an awareness campaign poster on sustainable farming practices:
1. Divide students into small groups
2. Each group creates a poster highlighting:
   - Impacts of excessive fertilizer use
   - Benefits of sustainable nutrient management
   - Practical tips for local farmers
3. Groups present their posters to the class

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

1. Recap key points of the lesson
2. Discuss how altered nutrient cycles relate to other planetary boundaries
3. Q&A session to address any remaining questions

## Homework Assignment

Research and write a 2-page report on one of the following topics:
1. Traditional farming practices in Timor-Leste and their impact on nutrient cycles
2. Case study of a successful sustainable agriculture project in a developing country
3. Potential use of organic fertilizers or composting in Timor-Leste agriculture

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Biogeochemical cycle: The movement and cycling of elements through the biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere
- Nitrogen fixation: The process of converting atmospheric nitrogen into biologically available forms
- Denitrification: The microbial process of converting nitrate to atmospheric nitrogen
- Phosphorus weathering: The breakdown of phosphorus-containing rocks, releasing phosphorus into the environment
- Eutrophication: Excessive richness of nutrients in a body of water, often due to runoff from land, causing dense plant growth and death of animal life from lack of oxygen
- Fertilizer runoff: The movement of excess nutrients from agricultural lands into water bodies through surface runoff or leaching
