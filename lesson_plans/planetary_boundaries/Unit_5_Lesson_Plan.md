# Lesson Plan: Freshwater Use and Global Hydrological Cycle

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on the global water cycle
- Maps of Timor-Leste's water resources
- Water testing kits
- Rainwater harvesting model or diagram
- Notebooks and writing materials for students

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the main components and processes of the global hydrological cycle
- Identify key water scarcity and quality issues in Timor-Leste
- Propose sustainable water management strategies for local communities
- Conduct a basic water audit
- Design a simple rainwater harvesting system

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to draw a quick sketch of where they think their drinking water comes from, from source to tap
- Have a few students share their sketches and discuss the various water sources and pathways

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Hydrological cycle
- Evaporation
- Transpiration
- Precipitation
- Groundwater
- Aquifer
- Water scarcity
- Water quality
- Watershed

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

a. Global Hydrological Cycle
   - Explain the main components and processes of the water cycle
   - Discuss the distribution of freshwater resources globally

b. Water Scarcity and Quality Issues in Timor-Leste
   - Present data on water availability and access in Timor-Leste
   - Discuss main causes of water scarcity (e.g., seasonal variability, infrastructure limitations)
   - Explain common water quality issues (e.g., contamination, salinity)

c. Sustainable Water Management Strategies
   - Introduce concepts of integrated water resource management
   - Discuss water conservation techniques
   - Explain rainwater harvesting and its potential in Timor-Leste

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

a. Water Cycle Diagram
   - In small groups, have students create a detailed diagram of the water cycle, including human impacts

b. Case Study Analysis
   - Provide students with a case study of a water-stressed community in Timor-Leste
   - Have them identify challenges and propose potential solutions

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

a. Water Audit Planning
   - In pairs, have students develop a plan for conducting a water audit of their school or a local institution
   - Students should list key areas to investigate and methods for measuring water use

b. Rainwater Harvesting Design
   - Individually or in small groups, have students sketch a basic design for a rainwater harvesting system for a typical Timorese home
   - Students should label key components and explain how the system works

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points about the global water cycle and Timor-Leste's water challenges
- Have students share one new thing they learned and one question they still have

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Complete the water audit plan and conduct the audit at home or in a chosen location
- Research and write a one-page report on a successful water management project in another developing country that could be adapted for Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Hydrological cycle: The continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere
- Evaporation: The process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas
- Transpiration: The process by which water vapor is released from plants into the atmosphere
- Precipitation: Water that falls to the Earth's surface as rain, snow, sleet, or hail
- Groundwater: Water held underground in soil or in pores and crevices in rock
- Aquifer: An underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or sediment
- Water scarcity: The lack of sufficient available water resources to meet water needs within a region
- Water quality: The chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water
- Watershed: An area of land that drains water, sediment, and dissolved materials to a common outlet
