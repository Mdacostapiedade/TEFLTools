## Global Hydrological Cycle

### Introduction
- The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere
- It is a complex system that includes many different processes

### Main Components of the Water Cycle
1. Evaporation
   - Process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas
   - Occurs from surface water bodies (oceans, lakes, rivers) and land surfaces
   - Driven by solar energy

2. Transpiration
   - Release of water vapor from plants through their leaves
   - Significant contributor to atmospheric water vapor

3. Condensation
   - Process by which water vapor in the air is changed into liquid water
   - Forms clouds and fog

4. Precipitation
   - Water released from clouds in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail
   - Primary mechanism for transporting water from the atmosphere back to Earth's surface

5. Infiltration and Percolation
   - Movement of water into and through the soil
   - Replenishes groundwater

6. Runoff
   - Flow of water over land surfaces
   - Feeds rivers, lakes, and ultimately oceans

7. Groundwater Flow
   - Movement of water underground through aquifers
   - Can resurface as springs or be extracted through wells

### Global Distribution of Freshwater
- 97.5% of Earth's water is in the oceans (saltwater)
- Only 2.5% is freshwater
  - 68.7% of freshwater is locked in ice caps and glaciers
  - 30.1% is groundwater
  - 1.2% is surface and other freshwater

### Human Impacts on the Water Cycle
- Urbanization: Increases runoff, decreases infiltration
- Deforestation: Reduces transpiration, increases runoff
- Agriculture: Alters local water cycles through irrigation and land-use changes
- Climate Change: Intensifies the water cycle, leading to more extreme weather events

## Water Scarcity and Quality Issues in Timor-Leste

### Water Availability in Timor-Leste
- Timor-Leste has a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons
- Annual rainfall varies significantly across the country (1,500-2,000 mm on average)
- Limited water storage infrastructure

### Main Causes of Water Scarcity
1. Seasonal Variability
   - Long dry season (May to November) leads to water shortages
   - Intense rainfall during wet season can cause flooding and water quality issues

2. Infrastructure Limitations
   - Lack of adequate water storage facilities
   - Poor distribution networks, especially in rural areas

3. Deforestation
   - Reduces water retention in soils
   - Increases erosion and sedimentation in water sources

4. Population Growth and Urbanization
   - Increasing demand for water in urban areas
   - Strain on existing water resources and infrastructure

### Water Quality Issues
1. Contamination
   - Inadequate sanitation facilities lead to fecal contamination of water sources
   - Agricultural runoff introduces pesticides and fertilizers into water bodies

2. Salinity
   - Coastal areas face saltwater intrusion into groundwater due to over-extraction

3. Sedimentation
   - Erosion from deforestation and poor land management practices leads to high sediment loads in rivers

4. Limited Water Treatment
   - Many communities lack access to treated water, relying on untreated sources

### Impacts of Water Scarcity and Poor Quality
- Health issues: Waterborne diseases are common
- Agricultural productivity: Crop yields affected by water shortages
- Economic development: Limited water access hinders industrial growth
- Education: Children, especially girls, miss school to collect water

## Sustainable Water Management Strategies

### Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM)
- Holistic approach to managing water resources
- Considers all aspects of the water cycle and human interactions
- Aims to balance social, economic, and environmental needs

### Water Conservation Techniques
1. Efficient Irrigation Systems
   - Drip irrigation
   - Sprinkler systems
   - Timing irrigation to reduce evaporation

2. Drought-Resistant Crops
   - Selecting crops adapted to local climate conditions
   - Crop rotation to manage soil moisture

3. Leak Detection and Repair
   - Regular maintenance of water distribution systems
   - Community-based monitoring programs

4. Water-Efficient Appliances and Fixtures
   - Low-flow taps and showerheads
   - Dual-flush toilets

5. Greywater Reuse
   - Using wastewater from sinks, showers for irrigation or toilet flushing

### Rainwater Harvesting
- Collection and storage of rainwater for later use
- Potential to significantly supplement water supply in Timor-Leste

#### Components of a Basic Rainwater Harvesting System
1. Catchment Area (usually a roof)
2. Gutters and Downspouts
3. First Flush Diverter (to remove initial contaminated runoff)
4. Storage Tank
5. Filtration System
6. Distribution System (pump or gravity-fed)

#### Benefits of Rainwater Harvesting in Timor-Leste
- Reduces demand on groundwater and surface water sources
- Provides water during dry season
- Relatively low-cost and low-tech solution
- Can be implemented at household or community level

### Watershed Management
- Protecting and restoring natural vegetation in catchment areas
- Implementing erosion control measures
- Community-based management of water resources

### Policy and Governance
- Developing and enforcing water use regulations
- Implementing water pricing strategies to encourage conservation
- Promoting public awareness and education on water issues
