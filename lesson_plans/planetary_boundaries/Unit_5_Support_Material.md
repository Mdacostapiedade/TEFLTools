Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Freshwater Use and Global Hydrological Cycle, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Freshwater Use and Global Hydrological Cycle Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Hydrological cycle**: The continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere
- **Evaporation**: The process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas
- **Transpiration**: The process by which water vapor is released from plants into the atmosphere
- **Precipitation**: Water that falls to the Earth's surface as rain, snow, sleet, or hail
- **Groundwater**: Water held underground in soil or in pores and crevices in rock
- **Aquifer**: An underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or sediment
- **Water scarcity**: The lack of sufficient available water resources to meet water needs within a region
- **Water quality**: The chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water
- **Watershed**: An area of land that drains water, sediment, and dissolved materials to a common outlet
- **Integrated water resource management**: A coordinated approach to managing water resources across sectors and stakeholders
- **Rainwater harvesting**: The collection and storage of rainwater for reuse

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Global Hydrological Cycle Diagram:

     * Oceans, lakes, and rivers
     * Evaporation and transpiration arrows pointing upward
     * Clouds and atmospheric water vapor
     * Precipitation arrows pointing downward
     * Groundwater and aquifers
     * Runoff arrows pointing towards water bodies

2. Map of Timor-Leste's Water Resources:
   - A map of Timor-Leste showing:
     * Major rivers and watersheds
     * Groundwater aquifers
     * Areas of water scarcity
     * Key water infrastructure (dams, treatment plants)

3. Rainwater Harvesting System Diagram:
   - A simple house diagram showing:
     * Sloped roof for water collection
     * Gutters and downspouts
     * First flush diverter
     * Storage tank
     * Filtration system
     * Pump for distribution

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may have limited understanding of water systems beyond their immediate experience.
   - Solution: Start with local examples and gradually expand to regional and global scales. Use visual aids and hands-on activities to make concepts more tangible.

2. Challenge: Some students may not see the relevance of global water issues to their daily lives.
   - Solution: Emphasize local water challenges in Timor-Leste and how they connect to global patterns. Use real-life examples and case studies from their communities.

3. Challenge: The technical aspects of water management may be difficult for some students to grasp.
   - Solution: Use simplified models and diagrams. Break down complex processes into smaller, more manageable steps. Encourage peer teaching and group work.

4. Challenge: Limited access to water testing equipment or field trip opportunities.
   - Solution: Use virtual field trips or video resources. Create simple DIY water testing kits using household materials. Invite guest speakers from local water management organizations.

5. Challenge: Students may feel overwhelmed by the scale of water issues.
   - Solution: Focus on positive actions and solutions. Highlight successful water management projects in Timor-Leste and other developing countries. Encourage students to start with small, achievable changes in their own water use.
