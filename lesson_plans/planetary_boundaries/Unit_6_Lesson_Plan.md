# Lesson Plan: Atmospheric Aerosol Loading and Ozone Depletion

## Resources Needed

- Computer with projector
- Air quality monitoring devices (e.g., portable PM2.5 sensors)
- Poster-making materials (large paper, markers, etc.)
- Handouts on aerosol sources and impacts
- Ozone depletion simulation software or online interactive tool

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Define atmospheric aerosols and explain their sources
2. Describe the impacts of aerosols on climate and human health
3. Explain the process of ozone depletion and its consequences
4. Identify major air quality issues in Timor-Leste
5. Propose strategies to reduce air pollution in their local community

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show students a series of images depicting air pollution in cities around the world
- Ask students to share their observations and discuss how air pollution might affect people and the environment

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Aerosols
- Particulate matter
- Ozone layer
- Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
- Air quality index (AQI)

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Atmospheric Aerosols
   - Definition and types of aerosols
   - Natural and anthropogenic sources
   - Impacts on climate (cooling and warming effects)
   - Health effects of particulate matter

2. Ozone Depletion
   - Structure and function of the ozone layer
   - Ozone depletion process and causes
   - Montreal Protocol and ozone recovery
   - Current status of the ozone layer

3. Air Quality Issues in Timor-Leste
   - Major sources of air pollution (e.g., vehicle emissions, biomass burning)
   - Current air quality monitoring efforts
   - Health impacts on the population

## Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Aerosol Impact Demonstration (15 minutes)
   - Use an online simulator to demonstrate how different types and concentrations of aerosols affect incoming solar radiation

2. Ozone Depletion Roleplay (25 minutes)
   - Divide students into groups representing different molecules (oxygen, CFCs, ozone)
   - Have them act out the process of ozone formation and destruction

## Production Tasks (45 minutes)

1. Air Quality Monitoring (20 minutes)
   - Take students outside to use portable air quality monitors
   - Record and analyze readings from different locations around the school or nearby areas

2. Public Awareness Poster Creation (25 minutes)
   - In small groups, students create posters on reducing air pollution in Timor-Leste
   - Topics can include reducing vehicle emissions, alternatives to biomass burning, or indoor air quality improvement

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Groups present their air quality findings and awareness posters
- Class discussion on the most pressing air quality issues in their community and potential solutions

## Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a one-page report on a specific air pollutant common in Timor-Leste, its sources, health impacts, and mitigation strategies
2. Keep a log of personal activities for one week that may contribute to air pollution, and suggest alternatives to reduce their impact

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Aerosols: Tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere, which can be solid or liquid
- Particulate matter: Microscopic solid or liquid matter suspended in the air
- Ozone layer: A region of Earth's stratosphere that absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation
- Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs): Synthetic chemical compounds once widely used in refrigerants and aerosol propellants, which contribute to ozone depletion
- Air quality index (AQI): A measure used to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become
