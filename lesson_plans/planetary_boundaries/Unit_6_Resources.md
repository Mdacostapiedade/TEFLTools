## Atmospheric Aerosols

### Definition and Types
- Aerosols: Tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere
- Can be solid or liquid
- Size range: 0.001 to 100 micrometers in diameter
- Examples: dust, sea salt, soot, pollen, sulfates

### Sources
1. Natural sources:
   - Volcanic eruptions
   - Dust storms
   - Sea spray
   - Forest fires
   - Biological sources (e.g., plant spores, bacteria)

2. Anthropogenic sources:
   - Fossil fuel combustion
   - Industrial processes
   - Agricultural activities
   - Biomass burning
   - Vehicle emissions

### Impacts on Climate
1. Cooling effects:
   - Direct effect: Scattering sunlight back to space
   - Indirect effect: Acting as cloud condensation nuclei, increasing cloud cover

2. Warming effects:
   - Absorption of solar radiation by dark aerosols (e.g., black carbon)
   - Deposition on snow and ice, reducing albedo

3. Complexity in climate models:
   - High uncertainty in aerosol-climate interactions
   - Regional variations in effects

### Health Effects
1. Respiratory issues:
   - Asthma exacerbation
   - Bronchitis
   - Reduced lung function

2. Cardiovascular problems:
   - Increased risk of heart attacks
   - Irregular heartbeat

3. Other health concerns:
   - Eye irritation
   - Skin problems
   - Potential carcinogenic effects of certain particles

4. Particulate matter (PM) categories:
   - PM10: Particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter
   - PM2.5: Particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (most dangerous)

## Ozone Depletion

### Structure and Function of the Ozone Layer
1. Location: Stratosphere (15-35 km above Earth's surface)
2. Composition: O₃ (ozone) molecules
3. Function: Absorbs 97-99% of the sun's high-frequency ultraviolet (UV) light

### Ozone Depletion Process
1. Natural ozone cycle:
   - Formation: O₂ + UV light → O + O, then O + O₂ → O₃
   - Destruction: O₃ + UV light → O₂ + O

2. Ozone depletion by CFCs:
   - CFC + UV light → Cl + FC
   - Cl + O₃ → ClO + O₂
   - ClO + O → Cl + O₂
   - Chlorine acts as a catalyst, destroying many ozone molecules

### Causes of Ozone Depletion
1. Primary cause: Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
   - Used in refrigerants, aerosol propellants, solvents
2. Other ozone-depleting substances:
   - Halons (fire extinguishers)
   - Carbon tetrachloride
   - Methyl chloroform

### Montreal Protocol and Ozone Recovery
1. Montreal Protocol (1987):
   - International treaty to phase out ozone-depleting substances
   - Ratified by 198 countries

2. Results:
   - 98% reduction in ozone-depleting substances
   - Ozone layer expected to recover to 1980 levels by 2050-2070

### Current Status of the Ozone Layer
1. Antarctic ozone hole:
   - Annual formation in spring (September-November)
   - Gradual healing observed since 2000

2. Global ozone levels:
   - Stabilized since 2000
   - Slow recovery in progress

3. Ongoing challenges:
   - Potential impact of climate change on ozone recovery
   - Emerging threats from new chemicals

## Air Quality Issues in Timor-Leste

### Major Sources of Air Pollution
1. Vehicle emissions:
   - Increasing number of vehicles in urban areas
   - Many older vehicles with poor emission controls

2. Biomass burning:
   - Agricultural practices (slash-and-burn)
   - Household cooking and heating

3. Industrial emissions:
   - Limited but growing industrial sector
   - Cement production, food processing

4. Dust from unpaved roads and construction sites

### Current Air Quality Monitoring Efforts
1. Limited monitoring infrastructure:
   - Few permanent air quality monitoring stations
   - Reliance on satellite data and occasional studies

2. Challenges:
   - Lack of consistent, long-term data
   - Limited resources for comprehensive monitoring

3. Opportunities:
   - Potential for low-cost sensor networks
   - International collaborations for capacity building

### Health Impacts on the Population
1. Respiratory diseases:
   - High incidence of acute respiratory infections
   - Increased asthma rates in urban areas

2. Cardiovascular issues:
   - Growing concern, especially among vulnerable populations

3. Vulnerable groups:
   - Children
   - Elderly
   - People with pre-existing health conditions

4. Economic impacts:
   - Healthcare costs
   - Lost productivity due to illness
