Here's the support material for the lesson on Atmospheric Aerosol Loading and Ozone Depletion, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Atmospheric Aerosol Loading and Ozone Depletion Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Aerosols**: Tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere, which can be solid or liquid
- **Particulate matter**: Microscopic solid or liquid matter suspended in the air
- **PM2.5**: Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less
- **PM10**: Particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less
- **Ozone layer**: A region of Earth's stratosphere that absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation
- **Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)**: Synthetic chemical compounds once widely used in refrigerants and aerosol propellants, which contribute to ozone depletion
- **Air quality index (AQI)**: A measure used to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become
- **Stratosphere**: The second major layer of Earth's atmosphere, above the troposphere
- **Ultraviolet (UV) radiation**: Electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths shorter than visible light but longer than X-rays
- **Montreal Protocol**: An international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of ozone-depleting substances

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Aerosol Sources and Impacts Diagram**
   - Description: A flowchart showing natural and anthropogenic sources of aerosols (e.g., volcanic eruptions, sea spray, industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust) and their impacts on climate (cooling and warming effects) and human health.

2. **Ozone Depletion Process Illustration**
   - Description: A series of images depicting the stratospheric ozone layer, CFC molecules rising to the stratosphere, and the chemical reactions leading to ozone depletion.

3. **Air Quality Index (AQI) Color Chart**
   - Description: A color-coded chart showing AQI ranges and their corresponding health implications, from green (good) to maroon (hazardous).

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Aerosol Sources and Impacts Worksheet**
   - Content: A table with columns for aerosol type, source (natural or anthropogenic), and impacts on climate and health. Students fill in the table based on the lesson and their own research.

2. **Ozone Depletion Quiz**
   - Content: Multiple-choice and short-answer questions covering the ozone layer's function, causes of depletion, and the Montreal Protocol's impact.

3. **Air Quality in Timor-Leste: Case Study Analysis**
   - Content: A brief overview of air quality issues in Timor-Leste, followed by questions prompting students to analyze causes, impacts, and potential solutions.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to understand the complex chemistry of ozone depletion.
   - **Solution**: Use physical models or interactive simulations to visualize the process. Break down the chemical reactions into simpler steps.

2. **Challenge**: Limited local data on air quality in Timor-Leste.
   - **Solution**: Encourage students to conduct their own air quality monitoring projects. Use data from similar developing countries as case studies.

3. **Challenge**: Students may feel overwhelmed by the global nature of these issues.
   - **Solution**: Focus on local impacts and actions. Emphasize individual and community-level solutions to empower students.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in visualizing microscopic aerosols and their impacts.
   - **Solution**: Use analogies (e.g., dust in a sunbeam) and hands-on demonstrations (e.g., filtering water to show particulate removal).

5. **Challenge**: Connecting abstract concepts to everyday life in Timor-Leste.
   - **Solution**: Incorporate local examples of air pollution sources (e.g., vehicle emissions, biomass burning) and their impacts on daily life and traditional practices.
