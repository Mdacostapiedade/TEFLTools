# Lesson Plan: Novel Entities and Chemical Pollution in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on types of chemical pollutants
- Plastic waste samples for demonstration
- Beach cleanup equipment (gloves, bags, tally sheets)
- Local waste management reports or data
- Recycling bin prototypes or materials to create them

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define novel entities and explain their potential impacts on the environment
- Identify major chemical pollutants affecting Timor-Leste
- Analyze the extent of plastic pollution in Timor-Leste's marine environments
- Evaluate current waste management practices in Timor-Leste
- Develop strategies for community-based recycling initiatives

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show students a collection of common plastic items found in everyday life
- Ask students to brainstorm where these items might end up after use
- Discuss the concept of "throwaway culture" and its environmental implications

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  - Novel entities
  - Persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
  - Heavy metals
  - Microplastics
  - Bioaccumulation
  - Circular economy

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Define novel entities and their relevance to planetary boundaries
- Overview of chemical pollution issues in Timor-Leste:
  - Persistent organic pollutants from agriculture and industry
  - Heavy metal contamination in water sources
  - Plastic pollution in marine environments
- Present data on waste generation and management in Timor-Leste
- Discuss the impacts of chemical pollution on ecosystems and human health
- Explore potential solutions and international efforts to address chemical pollution

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

- Group activity: Categorize different types of pollutants and their sources in Timor-Leste
- Analyze a case study of a polluted site in Timor-Leste, identifying potential remediation strategies
- Create a flowchart showing the lifecycle of a plastic bottle in Timor-Leste

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Conduct a mini beach cleanup and waste audit:
  - Divide students into groups and assign sections of a nearby beach or public area
  - Collect and categorize waste found
  - Record data on types and quantities of waste
- Group discussion on findings and implications for local ecosystems

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Summarize key points from the lesson
- Discuss the connections between novel entities, chemical pollution, and other planetary boundaries
- Reflect on personal actions that can reduce chemical pollution

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a proposal for a community-based recycling initiative that could be implemented in their local area
- Include:
  - Target materials for recycling
  - Collection methods
  - Processing and end-use of recycled materials
  - Community engagement strategies
  - Potential challenges and solutions

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Novel entities: Synthetic substances, or naturally occurring elements mobilized by human activities, with potential negative effects on Earth systems
- Persistent organic pollutants (POPs): Toxic chemicals that persist in the environment, bioaccumulate in food chains, and pose risks to human health and ecosystems
- Heavy metals: Metallic elements with high atomic weights that can be toxic to living organisms at certain concentrations
- Microplastics: Tiny plastic particles less than 5mm in size, often resulting from the breakdown of larger plastic items
- Bioaccumulation: The gradual accumulation of substances, such as pesticides or other chemicals, in an organism
- Circular economy: An economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources through reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling
