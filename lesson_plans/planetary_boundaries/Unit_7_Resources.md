# Lecture Notes

## Novel Entities and Their Impacts

### Definition and Concept
- Novel entities: Synthetic substances or naturally occurring elements mobilized by human activities
- Examples: plastics, artificial chemicals, heavy metals in new forms/locations
- Potential to disrupt Earth system processes in unpredictable ways

### Impacts on Environment and Health
- Bioaccumulation in food chains
- Persistence in environment (e.g., plastics, POPs)
- Toxicity to organisms and ecosystems
- Potential for long-term, unforeseen consequences

## Chemical Pollution in Timor-Leste

### Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)
- Sources: Agriculture (pesticides), industry, waste incineration
- Common POPs in Timor-Leste: DDT, PCBs, dioxins
- Environmental persistence and bioaccumulation
- Health impacts: cancer, reproductive disorders, immune system damage

### Heavy Metals
- Sources: Mining, industrial processes, improper waste disposal
- Common heavy metals: lead, mercury, cadmium
- Contamination of water sources and soil
- Health impacts: neurological damage, kidney damage, developmental issues

### Plastic Pollution in Marine Environments
- Sources: Improper waste disposal, coastal activities, fishing industry
- Types: Macroplastics, microplastics, nanoplastics
- Impacts on marine life: entanglement, ingestion, habitat destruction
- Entry into food chain and potential human health impacts

## Waste Management Challenges in Timor-Leste

### Current Waste Management Practices
- Limited formal waste collection and disposal systems
- Open dumping and burning of waste
- Lack of recycling infrastructure

### Challenges
- Rapid urbanization and increasing waste generation
- Limited public awareness of proper waste management
- Insufficient funding and resources for waste management systems
- Geographical challenges for waste collection in rural areas

### Potential Solutions
- Improved waste collection and disposal infrastructure
- Implementation of recycling and composting programs
- Public education and awareness campaigns
- Policy development for waste reduction and management

5. How might international agreements on chemical pollution and waste management benefit or challenge Timor-Leste?

6. What are some culturally appropriate strategies for promoting better waste management practices in Timorese communities?

7. How can the concept of a circular economy be applied to reduce chemical pollution and improve waste management in Timor-Leste?

8. What are the potential health disparities related to chemical pollution exposure in different regions or socioeconomic groups within Timor-Leste?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Essay: Personal Contribution to Plastic Pollution

1. Keep a log of all single-use plastic items you use in a 24-hour period.

2. Reflect on your plastic use by answering the following questions:
   - What patterns do you notice in your plastic consumption?
   - Which items could be easily replaced with reusable alternatives?
   - What challenges might you face in reducing your plastic use?

3. Research the journey of plastic waste in Timor-Leste, from disposal to its potential end in the marine environment.

4. Write a 500-word reflective essay that:
   - Summarizes your personal plastic use
   - Analyzes the potential impact of your plastic consumption on Timor-Leste's environment
   - Proposes realistic strategies for reducing your plastic footprint
   - Connects your individual actions to broader waste management challenges in Timor-Leste

5. Conclude with a reflection on how this exercise has changed your perspective on plastic pollution and waste management.

## Case Study: Plastic Bank in Indonesia

Plastic Bank is a social enterprise that builds recycling ecosystems in coastal communities, providing economic opportunities while preventing ocean plastic pollution. Their model in Indonesia can offer insights for potential initiatives in Timor-Leste.

Key points:
- Collectors gather plastic waste and exchange it for cash or credit
- Collected plastic is recycled into new products
- Provides income for vulnerable communities
- Raises awareness about plastic pollution
- Partnerships with local businesses and international brands
