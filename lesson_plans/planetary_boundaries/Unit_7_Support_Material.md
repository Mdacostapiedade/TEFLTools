Here's the support material for the lesson on Novel Entities and Chemical Pollution in Timor-Leste, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Novel Entities and Chemical Pollution Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Novel entities: Synthetic substances, or naturally occurring elements mobilized by human activities, with potential negative effects on Earth systems
- Persistent organic pollutants (POPs): Toxic chemicals that persist in the environment, bioaccumulate in food chains, and pose risks to human health and ecosystems
- Heavy metals: Metallic elements with high atomic weights that can be toxic to living organisms at certain concentrations
- Microplastics: Tiny plastic particles less than 5mm in size, often resulting from the breakdown of larger plastic items
- Bioaccumulation: The gradual accumulation of substances, such as pesticides or other chemicals, in an organism
- Circular economy: An economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources through reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling
- Leachate: Liquid that has passed through or emerged from waste and contains dissolved or suspended materials
- Eutrophication: Excessive richness of nutrients in a body of water, often due to runoff from the land, which causes dense growth of plant life and death of animal life from lack of oxygen
- Biomagnification: The increasing concentration of a substance in the tissues of organisms at successively higher levels in a food chain

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Planetary Boundaries Diagram:
   - A circular diagram showing the nine planetary boundaries, with novel entities highlighted
   - Include current status (safe, increasing risk, high risk) for each boundary

2. Chemical Pollution Pathways:
   - Flowchart showing how pollutants enter and move through the environment
   - Include sources (e.g., agriculture, industry, households), pathways (e.g., air, water, soil), and receptors (e.g., humans, wildlife, plants)

3. Plastic Pollution Lifecycle:
   - Infographic showing the journey of a plastic item from production to disposal and its environmental impacts at each stage

4. Circular Economy Model:
   - Diagram contrasting linear economy (take-make-dispose) with circular economy (reduce-reuse-recycle)

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Chemical Pollutant Identification Sheet:
   - Table with columns for pollutant name, source, environmental impact, and potential solutions
   - Include common pollutants found in Timor-Leste (e.g., pesticides, heavy metals, plastics)

2. Beach Cleanup Data Collection Form:
   - Categories of waste (e.g., plastic bottles, food wrappers, fishing gear)
   - Columns for tally marks and total count
   - Space for observations and reflections

3. Waste Management Case Study Analysis:
   - Brief description of a waste management challenge in Timor-Leste
   - Questions prompting students to identify issues, stakeholders, and potential solutions

4. Personal Action Plan Worksheet:
   - Template for students to list daily activities that contribute to chemical pollution
   - Columns for current practice, potential alternatives, and action steps

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Scientific Articles:
   - "Marine plastic debris in East Timor" by Alves et al. (2020)
   - "Environmental contamination and human exposure to PBDEs in the East Timorese environment" by Huang et al. (2019)

2. Reports:
   - UNEP Global Chemicals Outlook II
   - World Bank's "What a Waste 2.0: A Global Snapshot of Solid Waste Management to 2050"

3. Online Courses:
   - Coursera: "Chemicals and Health" by Johns Hopkins University
   - edX: "Circular Economy: An Introduction" by TU Delft

4. Websites:
   - Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions
   - Ellen MacArthur Foundation (for circular economy resources)

5. Documentaries:
   - "A Plastic Ocean"
   - "The Story of Plastic"

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited local data on chemical pollution
   - Solution: Encourage students to conduct small-scale surveys or interviews with community members to gather anecdotal evidence. Use regional data as a proxy where local data is unavailable.

2. Challenge: Students may feel overwhelmed by the scale of the problem
   - Solution: Focus on local, actionable solutions and emphasize the impact of individual actions. Share success stories from similar contexts.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in visualizing microscopic pollutants
   - Solution: Use analogies or scaled-up models to represent microplastics or chemical particles. Consider using online simulations or animations.

4. Challenge: Limited access to laboratory equipment for testing
   - Solution: Develop simple, low-cost experiments or observations that can be done with minimal equipment. Partner with local environmental agencies or universities for more advanced testing.

5. Challenge: Potential cultural sensitivities around waste and pollution
   - Solution: Approach the topic with cultural sensitivity, acknowledging traditional practices while promoting sustainable alternatives. Involve community elders or leaders in discussions.

6. Challenge: Varying levels of prior knowledge among students
   - Solution: Use pre-assessment activities to gauge student understanding. Provide differentiated tasks and additional resources for students who need more support or challenge.
