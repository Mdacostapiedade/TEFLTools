- Analyze policy and governance challenges for sustainability in Timor-Leste
- Develop an integrated sustainable development plan for a local community

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Students reflect on the question "How do environmental challenges in Timor-Leste connect to global planetary boundaries?" They share their thoughts with a partner, then discuss as a class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  - Planetary boundaries
  - Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
  - Integrated approach
  - Governance

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Lecture and discussion on:
  - Interactions between planetary boundaries (using diagrams from Steffen et al. 2015)
  - Alignment of SDGs with planetary boundaries
  - Overview of Timor-Leste's environmental policies and governance structures
  - Challenges and opportunities for sustainable development in Timor-Leste

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

- Jigsaw activity:
  1. Divide class into groups, each assigned a different planetary boundary
  2. Groups research how their boundary interacts with others and its relevance to Timor-Leste
  3. Regroup to share findings and create a comprehensive interaction map

- Case study analysis:
  - In pairs, students analyze a successful sustainable development project from another developing country, identifying key factors for success and potential application to Timor-Leste

## 7. Production Task (60 minutes)

- Group project: Sustainable Development Plan
  1. Divide class into groups representing different stakeholders (e.g., government, NGOs, local communities, businesses)
  2. Each group develops a sustainable development plan for a specific community in Timor-Leste, addressing:
     - Key environmental challenges
     - Relevant planetary boundaries
     - Alignment with SDGs
     - Policy recommendations
     - Implementation strategies
  3. Groups create a visual presentation of their plan

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion on common themes, challenges, and innovative solutions
- Recap of key lessons learned and their importance for Timor-Leste's future

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Individual reflection paper (500 words):
  "How can Timor-Leste balance economic development with staying within planetary boundaries? Discuss potential trade-offs and synergies."

- Prepare for next class:
  Read assigned sections of the UNDP Timor-Leste Environmental Outlook Report
