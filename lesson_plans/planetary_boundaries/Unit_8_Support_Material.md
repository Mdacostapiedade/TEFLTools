## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Planetary Boundaries Diagram:
   - A circular diagram showing the nine planetary boundaries
   - Each boundary represented by a wedge
   - Color-coded to show current status (green: safe, yellow: increasing risk, red: high risk)
   - Timor-Leste's specific challenges highlighted within relevant boundaries

2. SDGs and Planetary Boundaries Integration Chart:
   - A matrix showing SDGs on one axis and planetary boundaries on the other
   - Cells filled with symbols indicating strong positive interactions, trade-offs, or neutral relationships

3. Timor-Leste Environmental Challenges Map:
   - An outline map of Timor-Leste
   - Icons representing key environmental challenges placed in relevant locations
   - Legend explaining each icon and its significance

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Planetary Boundaries Interaction Worksheet:
   - Table with rows and columns for each planetary boundary
   - Students fill in cells with descriptions of how boundaries interact
   - Space for notes on relevance to Timor-Leste

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling to grasp the interconnected nature of planetary boundaries
   - Solution: Use physical demonstrations, such as a web of string connecting students representing different boundaries

2. Challenge: Difficulty relating global concepts to local Timor-Leste context
   - Solution: Consistently provide local examples and encourage students to share personal observations

3. Challenge: Overwhelming complexity of sustainable development planning
   - Solution: Break down the process into smaller, manageable steps and provide clear guidelines for each

4. Challenge: Limited access to up-to-date local environmental data
   - Solution: Encourage students to conduct simple data collection projects and collaborate with local environmental organizations

5. Challenge: Balancing optimism with realism when discussing environmental challenges
   - Solution: Highlight success stories and emphasize the potential for positive change while acknowledging the severity of issues

6. Challenge: Engaging students with diverse academic backgrounds
   - Solution: Use a variety of teaching methods (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) and encourage peer teaching

7. Challenge: Time management in covering all aspects of the lesson
   - Solution: Prioritize key concepts and be prepared to adjust the lesson plan as needed, possibly extending activities into future sessions
