# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Plant Biotechnology and Tissue Culture

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on plant biotechnology applications
- Examples of tissue-cultured plants (if available)
- Internet access for research

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define plant biotechnology and tissue culture
- Explain at least three applications of plant tissue culture
- Describe the importance of tissue culture for Timor Leste's agriculture
- Identify potential uses of tissue culture for local crops

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display images of various agricultural challenges in Timor Leste (e.g., disease-affected crops, low-yielding varieties)
- Ask students to brainstorm possible solutions to these challenges
- Introduce the concept of plant biotechnology as a potential solution

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Plant biotechnology
- Tissue culture
- Micropropagation
- Explant
- In vitro

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Overview of Plant Biotechnology
- Definition and scope
- Brief history and major milestones
- Current applications in agriculture and research

### Introduction to Plant Tissue Culture
- Definition and basic principles
- Types of tissue culture (e.g., meristem culture, embryo culture)
- Advantages over traditional propagation methods

### Importance of Tissue Culture for Timor Leste
- Rapid multiplication of disease-free planting material
- Conservation of rare or endangered plant species
- Crop improvement through selection of superior traits
- Potential economic benefits for farmers and the country

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

### Activity 1: Matching Game
- Provide students with cards containing tissue culture applications and local agricultural challenges
- Have them match the applications to the challenges they could potentially solve

### Activity 2: Case Study Analysis
- Present a brief case study of a successful tissue culture project in a neighboring Southeast Asian country
- Have students discuss in small groups how a similar approach could be applied in Timor Leste

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

### Group Discussion and Presentation
- Divide the class into small groups
- Assign each group a major crop or plant type important to Timor Leste (e.g., coffee, sandalwood, taro)
- Have groups research and discuss potential applications of tissue culture for their assigned plant
- Each group presents their findings to the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Summarize key points of the lesson
- Conduct a quick quiz using an online tool (e.g., Kahoot) to assess understanding of main concepts
- Address any remaining questions from students

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a one-page report on a plant biotechnology success story from another developing country
- Explain how a similar approach could be beneficial for Timor Leste's agriculture

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Plant biotechnology: The use of biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use in plants or agriculture
- Tissue culture: The growth of tissues or cells in an artificial medium separate from the parent organism
- Micropropagation: The practice of rapidly multiplying plant material to produce a large number of genetically identical plants using modern plant tissue culture methods
- Explant: The piece of tissue taken from a plant to use as starting material for a tissue culture
- In vitro: Literally "in glass"; refers to studies conducted using components of an organism that have been isolated from their usual biological context
