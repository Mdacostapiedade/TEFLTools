# Lesson Plan: Sterile Techniques and Laboratory Safety

## 1. Resources Needed

- Handwashing station with soap and paper towels
- Disposable gloves
- 70% ethanol spray bottles
- Bleach solution (10%)
- Sterile petri dishes and culture tubes
- Aluminum foil
- Hot plate or microwave
- Large clear plastic storage box or aquarium
- Plastic wrap or clear plastic sheet
- Scissors and tape
- Microscope slides and coverslips
- Prepared slides with common contaminants (fungi, bacteria)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Demonstrate proper handwashing and glove-wearing techniques
- Explain the importance of aseptic techniques in plant tissue culture
- Identify common sources of contamination in a laboratory setting
- Create a makeshift laminar flow hood for sterile work
- Properly sterilize basic laboratory equipment

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Divide students into pairs. Have each pair discuss and list potential sources of contamination in a laboratory setting. After 5 minutes, have pairs share their ideas with the class and compile a master list on the board.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Aseptic technique
- Sterile
- Contamination
- Laminar flow
- Autoclave
- Ethanol
- Bleach solution

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

a) Importance of sterile techniques in plant tissue culture
b) Common sources of contamination
c) Proper handwashing technique demonstration
d) Correct glove-wearing procedure
e) Methods of sterilization (autoclaving, chemical sterilization)
f) Creating a sterile work environment (laminar flow hood principles)
g) Basic laboratory safety procedures

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

a) Handwashing technique practice (5 minutes)
b) Glove-wearing practice (5 minutes)
c) Microscope activity: Observing prepared slides of common contaminants (10 minutes)
d) Sterilizing equipment demonstration and practice (10 minutes)
e) Creating a makeshift laminar flow hood (10 minutes)

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

In small groups, students will:
a) Set up a sterile work area using the makeshift laminar flow hood
b) Practice transferring sterile media between petri dishes using aseptic technique
c) Properly dispose of contaminated materials and clean up work area

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students answer 5 multiple-choice questions about key concepts covered in the lesson
- Class discussion: What were the most challenging aspects of maintaining sterile conditions?

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will:
1. Write a 1-page reflection on the importance of sterile techniques in plant tissue culture and potential consequences of contamination.
2. Research and describe three different sterilization methods not covered in class, explaining their advantages and disadvantages.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Aseptic technique: Methods used to prevent contamination from bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms.
- Sterile: Free from living microorganisms.
- Contamination: The presence of unwanted microorganisms in a culture or on equipment.
- Laminar flow: The movement of air in a smooth, uniform direction, used to maintain a sterile environment.
- Autoclave: A device that uses high-pressure steam to sterilize equipment and materials.
- Ethanol: An alcohol commonly used as a disinfectant in laboratory settings.
- Bleach solution: A mixture of sodium hypochlorite and water used for sterilization.
