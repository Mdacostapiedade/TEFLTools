## Importance of Sterile Techniques in Plant Tissue Culture

- Plant tissue culture requires a completely sterile environment
- Microorganisms can outcompete plant cells for nutrients
- Contamination can lead to loss of cultures and wasted resources
- Common contaminants: bacteria, fungi, yeasts, viruses
- Sources of contamination:
  - Air particles
  - Unsterile equipment or media
  - Improper handling techniques
  - Explant material

## Common Sources of Contamination

1. Air: Dust, spores, aerosols
2. Surfaces: Benchtops, equipment exteriors
3. Liquids: Unsterile water or solutions
4. Human: Skin, hair, breath, clothing
5. Plant material: Endogenous microorganisms

## Proper Handwashing Technique

1. Wet hands with clean running water
2. Apply soap and lather well
3. Scrub all surfaces for at least 20 seconds
4. Pay attention to fingertips, between fingers, and under nails
5. Rinse thoroughly under running water
6. Dry with clean paper towel or air dry

## Correct Glove-Wearing Procedure

1. Wash and dry hands before putting on gloves
2. Inspect gloves for holes or tears
3. Touch only the cuff when putting on gloves
4. Adjust for proper fit
5. Avoid touching face or non-sterile surfaces when wearing gloves
6. Remove by grasping the outer edge near the wrist
7. Peel away from hand, turning inside out
8. Dispose of gloves properly and wash hands

## Methods of Sterilization

### Autoclaving
- Uses high-pressure steam (121Â°C, 15 psi)
- Effective for heat-stable items (glassware, media, some plastics)
- Typical cycle: 15-20 minutes

### Chemical Sterilization
- 70% ethanol: Quick surface sterilization
- 10% bleach solution: Effective against most microorganisms
- Hydrogen peroxide: Alternative to bleach

## Creating a Sterile Work Environment

### Laminar Flow Hood Principles
- Provides a sterile work area through constant, unidirectional airflow
- HEPA filtration removes particles 0.3 microns or larger
- Proper use:
  - Clean with 70% ethanol before and after use
  - Work from clean to dirty areas
  - Minimize arm movements

## Basic Laboratory Safety Procedures

1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
2. Know locations of safety equipment (eyewash, shower, fire extinguisher)
3. No food or drink in the laboratory
4. Tie back long hair and avoid loose clothing
5. Clean up spills immediately
6. Dispose of materials properly
7. Report all accidents or injuries

# Discussion Questions

1. Why is maintaining a sterile environment crucial for plant tissue culture? What could happen if contamination occurs?

2. What are the most common sources of contamination in a tissue culture laboratory? How can we minimize these risks?

3. Compare and contrast different sterilization methods (autoclaving, chemical sterilization). When would you choose one method over another?

4. How does a laminar flow hood create a sterile work environment? What are the key principles behind its operation?

5. Discuss the potential consequences of improper laboratory safety procedures. How can we promote a culture of safety in the lab?

6. In resource-limited settings, what alternatives could be used to create a sterile work environment if a laminar flow hood is not available?

7. How might the sterile techniques learned in this lesson apply to other fields beyond plant tissue culture (e.g., medical research, food production)?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflection on Sterile Techniques

1. Explain the importance of sterile techniques in plant tissue culture.
2. Describe at least three potential consequences of contamination in tissue culture experiments.
3. Reflect on the most challenging aspects of maintaining sterile conditions based on your experience in today's lab.
4. Discuss how the principles of sterile technique might apply to other areas of your life or future career.

# Assignment Details

## Research on Sterilization Methods

1. Research and describe three different sterilization methods not covered in class.
2. For each method, provide the following information:
   - Name of the sterilization method
   - Brief description of how it works
   - Types of materials or equipment it can sterilize
   - Advantages of this method
   - Disadvantages or limitations
   - Any specific applications in plant tissue culture or biotechnology

3. Compare these methods to those discussed in class (autoclaving and chemical sterilization).

4. Conclude with your opinion on which method(s) might be most useful for a small-scale tissue culture lab in Timor Leste, considering factors such as cost, availability, and effectiveness.

Format: 2-3 pages, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins
Include a bibliography with at least 3 reputable sources (scientific journals, textbooks, or academic websites)
