# Lesson Plan: Plant Growth Media Preparation

## 1. Resources Needed

- Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium components
- Sucrose
- Agar
- Distilled water
- pH meter
- Magnetic stirrer and stir bars
- Autoclave or pressure cooker
- Glassware (beakers, flasks, measuring cylinders)
- Weighing scales
- Sterile culture tubes or petri dishes
- Pipettes and pipette tips
- Safety equipment (gloves, lab coats, goggles)
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on media composition

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the key components of plant growth media
- Prepare Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium
- Understand the importance of pH and sterilization in media preparation
- Identify potential local alternatives for growth media ingredients

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Brainstorming session: Ask students to list what they think plants need to grow. Write responses on the whiteboard and categorize them into macronutrients, micronutrients, and other factors (light, water, etc.).

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Macronutrients
- Micronutrients
- Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium
- Agar
- pH
- Autoclave

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduction to plant growth media
   - Purpose and importance in tissue culture
   - Types of media (solid vs. liquid)

2. Components of MS medium
   - Macronutrients and their roles
   - Micronutrients and their roles
   - Vitamins and organic compounds
   - Carbon source (sucrose)
   - Gelling agent (agar)

3. Importance of pH in media preparation
   - Optimal pH range for plant growth
   - How to adjust and measure pH

4. Sterilization techniques for media
   - Autoclaving process and principles
   - Importance of sterility in tissue culture

5. Local alternatives for media components
   - Potential substitutes for commercial ingredients
   - Considerations when using alternative components

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Media preparation demonstration:
   - Instructor demonstrates the preparation of MS medium
   - Students take notes on the process

2. Small group activity:
   - Divide class into groups of 3-4 students
   - Each group prepares a small batch of MS medium
   - Groups measure and adjust pH of their media

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Media sterilization:
   - Students load their prepared media into an autoclave or pressure cooker
   - Discuss safety precautions and proper operation of sterilization equipment

2. Pouring sterile media:
   - After sterilization, students practice pouring media into sterile culture tubes or petri dishes in a laminar flow hood or makeshift sterile environment

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

1. Class discussion:
   - What were the challenges in preparing the media?
   - How might the process be adapted for a low-resource setting?

2. Quick quiz:
   - Students answer 5 multiple-choice questions about media composition and preparation

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Research task:
   - Students investigate potential local alternatives for one component of MS medium
   - Prepare a short report on the alternative, including its availability, cost, and potential effectiveness

2. Calculation exercise:
   - Provide students with a modified MS recipe and ask them to calculate the amounts needed for a specific volume of media

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Macronutrients: Essential elements required by plants in relatively large quantities (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium)
- Micronutrients: Essential elements required by plants in small quantities (e.g., iron, manganese, zinc)
- Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium: A commonly used plant tissue culture medium developed by Toshio Murashige and Folke K. Skoog in 1962
- Agar: A gelatinous substance derived from seaweed, used as a solidifying agent in growth media
- pH: A measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution
- Autoclave: A pressure chamber used to sterilize equipment and media by subjecting them to high-pressure saturated steam
