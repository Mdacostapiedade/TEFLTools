# Lesson Plan: Explant Selection and Preparation

## 1. Resources Needed

- Various local plant materials (e.g., cassava, sweet potato, taro)
- Sterile scalpels, forceps, and petri dishes
- 70% ethanol solution
- 10% bleach solution
- Sterile distilled water
- Sterile paper towels
- Gloves and lab coats
- Microscope (if available)
- Handouts with explant selection guidelines

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify suitable explants for tissue culture from various plant species
- Perform surface sterilization of plant material
- Prepare explants for culture initiation

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Plant part identification game: Display various plant parts (leaves, stems, roots, flowers) and have students quickly identify them and suggest which might be good for tissue culture.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Explant
- Surface sterilization
- Aseptic technique
- Meristem
- Contamination

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Choosing Appropriate Explants
- Discuss factors in selecting explants:
  - Plant species and cultivar
  - Age and condition of the plant
  - Type of tissue (meristematic vs. differentiated)
- Show examples of good explant sources for common crops

### Surface Sterilization Techniques
- Explain the importance of surface sterilization
- Demonstrate the general steps:
  1. Washing in running water
  2. Ethanol rinse
  3. Bleach solution soak
  4. Sterile water rinses

### Preparing Explants for Culture
- Demonstrate proper cutting techniques
- Discuss optimal explant size
- Explain immediate transfer to culture medium

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

### Activity 1: Explant Selection
Students examine various plant materials and select appropriate explants, justifying their choices.

### Activity 2: Surface Sterilization
In small groups, students practice the surface sterilization procedure on selected plant materials.

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

Students prepare sterilized explants for a local crop plant, following all steps from selection to final preparation for culture initiation.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key concepts
- Group discussion on challenges faced during the practical activities
- Recap of the importance of proper explant selection and preparation

## 9. Homework Assignment

Research and write a short report on explant selection and preparation for a crop plant important to Timor Leste that was not covered in class.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Explant: A piece of tissue taken from a plant to use as starting material for tissue culture.
- Surface sterilization: The process of removing microorganisms from the surface of plant material before tissue culture.
- Aseptic technique: Methods used to prevent contamination by microorganisms during laboratory procedures.
- Meristem: Plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells capable of cell division.
- Contamination: The presence of unwanted microorganisms in a tissue culture.
