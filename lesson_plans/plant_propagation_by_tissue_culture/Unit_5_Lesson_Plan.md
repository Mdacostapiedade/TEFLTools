# Lesson Plan: Culture Initiation and Maintenance

## 1. Resources Needed

- Laminar flow hood or sterile work area
- Sterile forceps, scalpels, and other tools
- Pre-prepared growth media in culture tubes or plates
- Sterilized explants from various local crop plants
- 70% ethanol for sterilization
- Sterile gloves and lab coats
- Incubator or growth chamber
- Data recording sheets and pens
- Microscope (optional)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Properly inoculate plant explants into growth media using aseptic technique
- Understand and control environmental factors affecting culture growth
- Perform basic subculturing procedures
- Monitor and record culture growth accurately

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Quick quiz on sterile technique and lab safety procedures learned in previous units. Students pair up and quiz each other using flashcards prepared by the instructor.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Inoculation
- Explant
- Subculture
- Photoperiod
- Contamination

Use visual aids or demonstrations to reinforce understanding.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### 5.1 Inoculation Process
- Demonstrate proper technique for transferring explants to media
- Explain importance of working quickly and maintaining sterility

### 5.2 Environmental Factors
- Discuss optimal temperature, light, and humidity conditions
- Explain how to set up and maintain a growth chamber or incubator

### 5.3 Subculturing Techniques
- Demonstrate how to identify when subculturing is necessary
- Show proper technique for dividing and transferring cultures

### 5.4 Monitoring Culture Growth
- Explain what to observe and record (color changes, growth rate, contamination)
- Demonstrate use of data recording sheets

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

Students work in pairs to:
1. Inoculate pre-sterilized explants into growth media
2. Set up cultures in the growth chamber or incubator
3. Practice subculturing technique on demo cultures
4. Begin filling out growth monitoring sheets

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

Each student group selects a local crop plant and:
1. Researches optimal growth conditions for that plant
2. Designs a culture initiation and maintenance plan
3. Prepares a brief presentation on their plan

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick recap of key points from the lesson
- Address any questions or concerns from students
- Preview the long-term culture monitoring project

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Complete the culture initiation and maintenance plan for chosen plant
2. Begin a literature review on tissue culture methods for that specific plant
3. Prepare to present findings in the next class

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Inoculation: The process of introducing plant tissue into a sterile growth medium
- Explant: A piece of tissue taken from a plant to use as starting material for a tissue culture
- Subculture: The process of transferring some or all of a culture to fresh medium to allow for continued growth
- Photoperiod: The duration of light exposure in a 24-hour period, critical for plant growth and development
- Contamination: The unintended introduction of microorganisms into a culture, often leading to culture failure
