# Lesson Plan: Micropropagation Techniques

## 1. Resources Needed

- Laminar flow hood or sterile work area
- Sterile instruments (scalpels, forceps)
- Growth media (MS medium with appropriate hormones)
- Sterile culture vessels
- Plant material (local ornamental plant and crop plant)
- Microscopes
- Sterilization agents (70% ethanol, 10% bleach solution)
- Sterile water
- Gloves and lab coats
- Datasheets for recording observations

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain different micropropagation methods
- Perform shoot tip culture on a local ornamental plant
- Induce callus formation in a crop plant
- Compare and contrast various micropropagation techniques

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Students will brainstorm in small groups about the potential benefits of micropropagation for Timor Leste's agriculture. Each group will share their top ideas with the class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Shoot tip culture
- Meristem culture
- Somatic embryogenesis
- Callus culture
- Organogenesis

Use visual aids or diagrams to illustrate these concepts.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of micropropagation methods
- Detailed explanation of shoot tip culture technique
- Process of callus induction and organogenesis
- Advantages and disadvantages of each method
- Applications in agriculture and horticulture

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

Students will rotate through stations to observe and sketch:
1. Shoot tip cultures at different stages
2. Callus tissue under a microscope
3. Somatic embryos at various developmental stages
4. Examples of successful micropropagation in different plant species

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Group A: Perform shoot tip culture on a local ornamental plant
- Group B: Induce callus formation in a crop plant important to Timor Leste

Both groups will follow provided protocols and record their procedures and observations.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion on the day's activities
- Review of key concepts and techniques
- Q&A session to address any uncertainties

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will:
1. Research one micropropagation success story relevant to Timor Leste or Southeast Asia
2. Write a 1-page summary of the technique used, its benefits, and potential applications in Timor Leste
3. Prepare 3 discussion questions based on their research

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Shoot tip culture: A technique that uses the shoot tip or meristem to produce multiple shoots
- Meristem culture: Culture of the apical meristem to produce virus-free plants
- Somatic embryogenesis: The process by which somatic cells develop into embryos
- Callus culture: The growth of undifferentiated cell masses on solid medium
- Organogenesis: The process of forming new organs from cultured tissue
