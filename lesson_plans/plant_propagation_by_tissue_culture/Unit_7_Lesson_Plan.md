# Lesson Plan: Acclimatization and Transplanting

## 1. Resources Needed

- Tissue-cultured plants ready for acclimatization
- Potting soil and small pots
- Plastic domes or clear plastic bags
- Spray bottles
- Thermometer and hygrometer
- Growth chamber or sheltered area for hardening off plants
- Handouts on acclimatization process
- Data collection sheets

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the importance of acclimatization for tissue-cultured plants
- Demonstrate proper techniques for transplanting in vitro plants to soil
- Design and implement an acclimatization protocol for a specific plant species
- Monitor and adjust environmental conditions during the hardening off process

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Group discussion: Ask students to brainstorm why tissue-cultured plants might struggle when directly transplanted to soil. List their ideas on the board and discuss the environmental differences between in vitro and ex vitro conditions.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Acclimatization
- Hardening off
- Relative humidity
- Stomata
- Cuticle
- Photosynthetic efficiency

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Importance of acclimatization
   - Differences between in vitro and ex vitro environments
   - Physiological changes needed for survival

2. Steps in the acclimatization process
   - Gradual reduction of relative humidity
   - Increasing light intensity
   - Adjusting temperature
   - Introducing natural air currents

3. Transplanting techniques
   - Proper removal of agar medium
   - Selecting appropriate potting mix
   - Planting depth and care

4. Monitoring and care during acclimatization
   - Humidity control methods
   - Watering practices
   - Pest and disease management

5. Common problems and troubleshooting
   - Wilting
   - Leaf necrosis
   - Fungal infections

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Demonstration: Instructor demonstrates proper transplanting technique with a tissue-cultured plant.

2. Hands-on practice: Students work in pairs to transplant tissue-cultured plants to soil, following the demonstrated technique.

3. Setting up acclimatization chambers: Groups of students set up small acclimatization chambers using plastic domes or bags, adjusting for proper humidity and ventilation.

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Design an acclimatization protocol: In small groups, students design an acclimatization protocol for a local plant species, considering its specific requirements.

2. Presentation: Each group presents their protocol to the class, explaining their rationale for each step.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

1. Class discussion: Review key points of the acclimatization process and address any questions.

2. Quick quiz: Students complete a short quiz on the main concepts covered in the lesson.

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Research paper: Students write a 2-page paper on the commercial applications of tissue culture and acclimatization for a crop or ornamental plant important to Timor Leste.

2. Data collection: Students monitor and record data on the acclimatization progress of their transplanted plants over the next week, to be discussed in the following class.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Acclimatization: The process of adapting an organism to a new environment.
- Hardening off: Gradually exposing plants to outdoor conditions to toughen them up.
- Relative humidity: The amount of water vapor present in air expressed as a percentage of the amount needed for saturation at the same temperature.
- Stomata: Tiny pores in plant leaves that control gas exchange.
- Cuticle: A waxy, water-resistant layer on the outer surface of plant leaves.
- Photosynthetic efficiency: The rate at which plants can convert light energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis.
