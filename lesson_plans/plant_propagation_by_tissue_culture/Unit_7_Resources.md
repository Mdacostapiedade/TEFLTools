# Lecture Notes

## Importance of Acclimatization

- In vitro vs. ex vitro environments:
  - In vitro: High humidity, low light, controlled temperature, sterile conditions
  - Ex vitro: Variable humidity, higher light, fluctuating temperature, presence of microorganisms
- Physiological changes needed for survival:
  - Development of functional stomata
  - Increased cuticle thickness
  - Enhanced root function
  - Improved photosynthetic efficiency

## Steps in the Acclimatization Process

1. Gradual reduction of relative humidity:
   - Start at 90-100% RH
   - Reduce by 5-10% every few days
   - Aim for 50-60% RH by end of process

2. Increasing light intensity:
   - Begin with 50-100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹
   - Gradually increase to 200-400 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹
   - Monitor for leaf bleaching or burning

3. Adjusting temperature:
   - Maintain consistent temperature initially (25-28°C)
   - Gradually introduce diurnal temperature fluctuations

4. Introducing natural air currents:
   - Start with gentle air movement
   - Increase air circulation gradually

## Transplanting Techniques

1. Proper removal of agar medium:
   - Gently wash roots in lukewarm water
   - Remove all traces of agar to prevent contamination

2. Selecting appropriate potting mix:
   - Use sterile, well-draining potting mix
   - Consider adding perlite or vermiculite for improved aeration

3. Planting depth and care:
   - Plant at same depth as in culture vessel
   - Ensure good contact between roots and soil
   - Water gently to settle soil around roots

## Monitoring and Care During Acclimatization

1. Humidity control methods:
   - Use of plastic domes or bags
   - Misting systems
   - Gradual increase in ventilation

2. Watering practices:
   - Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged
   - Water at base of plant to avoid wetting leaves

3. Pest and disease management:
   - Monitor for signs of fungal growth or insect infestation
   - Use appropriate treatments if necessary

## Common Problems and Troubleshooting

1. Wilting:
   - Cause: Rapid water loss due to poor stomatal function
   - Solution: Increase humidity, reduce light intensity temporarily

2. Leaf necrosis:
   - Cause: Excessive light or nutrient imbalance
   - Solution: Adjust light levels, check nutrient status of potting mix

3. Fungal infections:
   - Cause: High humidity and poor air circulation
   - Solution: Improve ventilation, reduce humidity, apply fungicide if necessary

# Discussion Questions

1. Why is acclimatization necessary for tissue-cultured plants? How does it differ from hardening off conventionally grown seedlings?

2. What are the most critical environmental factors to control during the acclimatization process? How do these factors affect plant physiology?

3. How might acclimatization protocols differ for plants from different climatic regions (e.g., tropical vs. temperate plants)?

4. What are some potential challenges in implementing tissue culture and acclimatization techniques in Timor Leste? How might these be overcome?

5. How can the acclimatization process be optimized for commercial plant production? What factors should be considered?

6. Discuss the ethical implications of plant biotechnology and tissue culture. How might these techniques impact traditional farming practices in Timor Leste?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a detailed protocol for acclimatizing a tissue-cultured plant of your choice. Your protocol should include:

1. Introduction: Brief background on the chosen plant and its importance
2. Materials needed: List all equipment and supplies required
3. Step-by-step procedure: Detailed instructions for each stage of acclimatization
4. Monitoring and data collection: Describe what data should be collected and how often
5. Troubleshooting: Address potential issues and how to resolve them
6. Expected outcomes: Describe what a successfully acclimatized plant should look like

Your protocol should be written in a clear, concise manner that could be followed by someone with basic knowledge of plant tissue culture. Include any necessary diagrams or illustrations to support your instructions.

# Assignment Details

## Research Paper: Commercial Applications of Tissue Culture in Timor Leste

Write a 2-page paper (single-spaced, 12-point font) on the potential commercial applications of tissue culture and acclimatization for a crop or ornamental plant important to Timor Leste. Your paper should include:

1. Introduction to the chosen plant and its significance in Timor Leste
2. Current propagation methods and their limitations
3. Potential benefits of tissue culture for this plant
4. Challenges in implementing tissue culture techniques
5. Proposed strategy for commercial-scale production using tissue culture
6. Economic impact analysis
7. Conclusion and recommendations

Use at least 5 credible sources, properly cited in APA format. Include a bibliography at the end of your paper.

## Data Collection Assignment

Over the next week, monitor and record data on the acclimatization progress of your transplanted plants. Create a data sheet that includes the following information:

- Date and time of observation
- Temperature (°C)
- Relative humidity (%)
- Light intensity (if possible)
- Plant height (cm)
- Number of leaves
- Leaf color and appearance
- Root development (if visible)
- Any signs of stress or disease

Make observations at least once daily. Bring your completed data sheets to the next class for discussion and analysis.
