# Support Material for Acclimatization and Transplanting Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Acclimatization**: The process of adapting an organism to a new environment.
- **Hardening off**: Gradually exposing plants to outdoor conditions to toughen them up.
- **Relative humidity**: The amount of water vapor present in air expressed as a percentage of the amount needed for saturation at the same temperature.
- **Stomata**: Tiny pores in plant leaves that control gas exchange.
- **Cuticle**: A waxy, water-resistant layer on the outer surface of plant leaves.
- **Photosynthetic efficiency**: The rate at which plants can convert light energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis.
- **In vitro**: Occurring or made to occur in a laboratory vessel or other controlled experimental environment.
- **Ex vitro**: Outside of a laboratory vessel or controlled experimental environment; in natural conditions.
- **Tissue culture**: The growth of tissues or cells separate from the organism in an artificial medium for experimental research.
- **Transplant shock**: Stress experienced by plants when moved from one growing location to another.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Acclimatization Process Diagram**: A flowchart showing the steps of acclimatization from in vitro to ex vitro conditions. Include icons for humidity, light intensity, temperature, and air movement, with arrows indicating gradual changes.

2. **Stomata and Cuticle Illustration**: A cross-section of a leaf showing the location and structure of stomata and the cuticle layer. Label key parts and their functions.

3. **Transplanting Technique Infographic**: A step-by-step visual guide showing the proper technique for transplanting tissue-cultured plants, including removal from agar, root cleaning, and planting in soil.

4. **Acclimatization Chamber Setup**: A diagram of a simple acclimatization chamber using a plastic dome or bag, with labels for ventilation holes, humidity control, and plant placement.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Acclimatization Protocol Worksheet**: A template for students to design their own acclimatization protocol, including sections for:
   - Plant species name
   - Initial environmental conditions (humidity, light, temperature)
   - Weekly adjustments to conditions
   - Watering and fertilization schedule
   - Monitoring checklist (plant health indicators)

2. **Transplanting Checklist**: A step-by-step checklist for students to follow during the transplanting process, including safety precautions and best practices.

3. **Data Collection Sheet**: A table for recording daily observations of transplanted plants, including:
   - Date
   - Plant height
   - Number of leaves
   - Leaf color
   - Signs of stress or disease
   - Environmental conditions (humidity, temperature)

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Research paper: "Acclimatization of Tissue-Cultured Plants" by Pospíšilová et al. (1999) in Biologia Plantarum.

2. Book chapter: "Acclimatization of Micropropagated Plants" in "Plant Propagation by Tissue Culture" by George et al. (2008).

3. Online course: "Plant Biotechnology: Acclimatization Techniques" on Udemy.

4. Video tutorial: "Hardening of Tissue Culture Plants" by Agri Learns on YouTube.

5. Local resource: Contact the National Directorate of Agriculture and Horticulture in Timor Leste for specific guidelines on acclimatizing local plant species.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with maintaining sterile conditions during transplanting.
   **Solution**: Provide extra practice sessions on sterile technique before the main activity. Consider using food coloring on gloves to demonstrate contamination spread.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to commercial acclimatization chambers.
   **Solution**: Demonstrate how to create low-cost alternatives using plastic bags or repurposed containers. Encourage students to be creative with locally available materials.

3. **Challenge**: Plants showing signs of stress or dying during acclimatization.
   **Solution**: Emphasize the importance of gradual changes and close monitoring. Have students work in pairs to ensure consistent care and observation.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in adjusting environmental conditions precisely.
   **Solution**: Use simple, affordable tools like DIY humidity tents and adjustable LED grow lights. Teach students to make incremental changes and observe plant responses.

5. **Challenge**: Students struggling to understand the physiological changes during acclimatization.
   **Solution**: Use analogies to human adaptation to new environments. Incorporate simple experiments to demonstrate concepts like transpiration and photosynthesis efficiency.
