# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Plant Propagation in Timor Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- PowerPoint presentation on Timor Leste's flora and agricultural systems
- Handouts with basic plant propagation principles
- Samples of native plant species (leaves, seeds, cuttings)
- Magnifying glasses
- Notebooks and pens for students
- Transportation for field trip

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the importance of plant propagation in Timor Leste's agriculture and ecology
- Identify at least 5 key native plant species suitable for advanced propagation techniques
- Describe 3 basic principles of plant propagation

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display various native plant samples and ask students to identify them
- Discuss the uses and importance of these plants in Timor Leste's culture and economy

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Propagation
- Native species
- Biodiversity
- Agroforestry
- Rootstock
- Scion

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of Timor Leste's flora and agricultural systems
  * Unique biodiversity of the region
  * Major crop systems and their challenges
- Basic principles of plant propagation
  * Sexual vs. asexual propagation
  * Advantages of vegetative propagation for preserving desirable traits
- Importance of preserving and improving native plant species
  * Conservation of genetic diversity
  * Adaptation to local climate and soil conditions
  * Cultural and economic significance

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- Group activity: Sort provided plant samples into categories based on potential propagation methods
- Pair work: Discuss and list potential benefits of propagating specific native plants

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Individual task: Sketch and label a native plant, indicating parts that could be used for propagation
- Small group task: Create a poster highlighting the importance of a chosen native plant species and how propagation could benefit its cultivation or conservation

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion: Share key takeaways from the lesson
- Quick quiz: Match plant propagation terms with their definitions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a one-page report on a native Timorese plant species, including its cultural significance, current cultivation practices, and potential for improved propagation

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Propagation: The process of creating new plants from seeds, cuttings, or other plant parts
- Native species: Plants that naturally occur in a specific region without human introduction
- Biodiversity: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
- Agroforestry: A land use management system that combines trees or shrubs with crops or livestock
- Rootstock: The root system and lower part of the stem of a plant onto which another variety is grafted
- Scion: A detached living portion of a plant joined to a stock in grafting
