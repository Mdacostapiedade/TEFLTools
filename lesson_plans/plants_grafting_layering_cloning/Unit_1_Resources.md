## Overview of Timor Leste's Flora and Agricultural Systems

### Unique Biodiversity
- Timor Leste is part of the Wallacea biodiversity hotspot
- Over 1,500 plant species recorded, with many endemic species
- Diverse ecosystems: tropical rainforests, monsoon forests, mangroves, and savanna woodlands

### Major Crop Systems
- Subsistence agriculture dominates
  * Main crops: maize, cassava, sweet potato, rice
- Cash crops: coffee, coconut, candlenut
- Challenges:
  * Soil erosion and degradation
  * Limited access to improved varieties and techniques
  * Climate variability and extreme weather events

## Basic Principles of Plant Propagation

### Sexual Propagation
- Reproduction through seeds
- Advantages:
  * Genetic diversity
  * Potential for adaptation
- Disadvantages:
  * Variability in offspring
  * Longer time to maturity

### Asexual Propagation
- Reproduction using plant parts other than seeds
- Methods: cuttings, grafting, layering, division
- Advantages:
  * Genetic uniformity
  * Faster maturity
  * Preservation of desirable traits
- Disadvantages:
  * Limited genetic diversity
  * Potential for disease spread

## Importance of Preserving and Improving Native Plant Species

### Conservation of Genetic Diversity
- Native plants are adapted to local conditions
- Preserve unique genetic traits for future breeding programs
- Maintain ecosystem balance and biodiversity

### Adaptation to Local Climate and Soil Conditions
- Native plants often more resilient to local pests and diseases
- Better suited to withstand local climate extremes
- Efficient use of local soil nutrients and water resources

### Cultural and Economic Significance
- Many native plants have traditional medicinal uses
- Important in local customs and ceremonies
- Potential for developing new economic opportunities

# Discussion Questions

1. How does Timor Leste's unique geography contribute to its biodiversity?
2. What are the main challenges facing agricultural systems in Timor Leste, and how might improved plant propagation techniques address these challenges?
3. Compare and contrast sexual and asexual propagation methods. In what situations might each be preferable?
4. How can the preservation and improvement of native plant species contribute to both ecological conservation and economic development in Timor Leste?
5. Discuss the potential risks and benefits of introducing non-native plant species for agriculture in Timor Leste.

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Choose a native plant species from Timor Leste and discuss its ecological, cultural, and potential economic importance. Explain how advanced propagation techniques could be used to preserve and improve this species, and describe the potential benefits and challenges of doing so."

Your essay should include:
- A brief description of the chosen plant species
- Its current status and uses in Timor Leste
- At least two specific propagation techniques that could be applied
- Potential benefits of improving propagation of this species
- Possible challenges or drawbacks to consider

# Assignment Details

## Native Plant Catalog Project

### Objective
Create a detailed catalog of native plants in Timor Leste with propagation potential.

### Instructions
1. Form groups of 3-4 students
2. Each group will research and document 10 native plant species
3. For each species, provide the following information:
   - Scientific and common names
   - Brief description and identifying characteristics
   - Natural habitat and distribution in Timor Leste
   - Traditional uses (if any)
   - Current conservation status
   - Potential propagation methods
   - Possible applications in agriculture, forestry, or conservation

### Format
- Create a digital or physical catalog
- Include photographs or illustrations for each species
- Provide a bibliography of sources used

### Presentation
Each group will give a 10-minute presentation on their catalog, highlighting:
- The most interesting or important species they discovered
- Challenges they encountered in researching native plants
- Potential opportunities for using these plants in propagation projects

### Due Date
The catalog and presentation are due at the end of week 3.

# Additional Materials

## Key Native Plant Species of Timor Leste (Examples)

1. Sandalwood (Santalum album)
   - Highly valued aromatic wood
   - Historically overexploited, now rare
   - Potential for reforestation and sustainable harvesting

2. White Gum (Eucalyptus urophylla)
   - Endemic to Timor and nearby islands
   - Important for timber and essential oils
   - Suitable for agroforestry systems

3. Candlenut (Aleurites moluccana)
   - Traditional source of oil for lighting and cooking
   - Potential for biodiesel production
   - Suitable for erosion control on slopes

4. Timorese Mountain Gum (Eucalyptus orophila)
   - Endemic to Timor-Leste's mountains
   - Valuable for timber and essential oils
   - Important for high-altitude reforestation

5. Ai-dak (Schleichera oleosa)
   - Multipurpose tree with edible seeds
   - Wood used for construction and fuel
   - Potential for agroforestry and soil improvement
