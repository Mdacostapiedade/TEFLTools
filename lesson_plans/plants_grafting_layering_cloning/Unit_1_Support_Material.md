       - Cuttings (Stem, Leaf, Root)
       - Grafting
       - Layering
       - Division

2. **Timor Leste Biodiversity Map**
   - A map of Timor Leste highlighting different ecological zones and their characteristic plant species

3. **Basic Grafting Technique Illustration**
   - Step-by-step visual guide showing:
     1. Preparing the rootstock
     2. Preparing the scion
     3. Joining rootstock and scion
     4. Securing the graft
     5. Aftercare

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Native Plant Identification Guide**
   - A handout with images and brief descriptions of 10 important native plant species in Timor Leste, including their common names, scientific names, and traditional uses

2. **Plant Propagation Methods Worksheet**
   - A table for students to fill in, matching plant species with suitable propagation methods and explaining their choices

3. **Propagation Benefits Analysis**
   - A worksheet prompting students to list potential benefits of propagating specific native plants, considering ecological, economic, and cultural factors

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Plants of Timor-Leste" by Curt Daehler and Nuno Vasco Rodrigues
2. "Tropical Horticulture and Gardening" by M.K. Sadhu
3. Online resource: FAO's "Propagating and planting trees" guide (http://www.fao.org/3/y5189e/y5189e00.htm)
4. Local resource: Timor-Leste Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries publications on native plant species
5. Video series: "Plant Propagation Techniques" by University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources (available on YouTube)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language barriers**: 
   - Prepare key terms in both English and Tetum
   - Use visual aids extensively to support understanding

2. **Limited access to plant materials**:
   - Coordinate with local botanical gardens or nurseries in advance
   - Encourage students to bring in plant samples from their own environments

3. **Varying levels of prior knowledge**:
   - Conduct a pre-lesson survey to assess students' familiarity with the topic
   - Prepare additional activities for advanced students

4. **Lack of hands-on experience**:
   - Incorporate as many practical activities as possible, even with limited resources
   - Use role-playing or simulation exercises if actual plant materials are scarce

5. **Connecting to local context**:
   - Invite a local farmer or traditional knowledge holder as a guest speaker
   - Assign students to interview family members about traditional plant propagation methods

6. **Maintaining student engagement**:
   - Use a mix of individual, pair, and group activities
   - Incorporate local stories or legends related to plants into the lesson

7. **Limited technology access**:
   - Prepare printed materials as backup for PowerPoint presentations
   - Use physical models or drawings instead of digital resources when necessary
