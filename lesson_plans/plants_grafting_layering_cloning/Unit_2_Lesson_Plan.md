# Lesson Plan: Grafting Fundamentals

## 1. Resources Needed

- Grafting knives
- Pruning shears
- Grafting tape or rubber bands
- Grafting wax
- Rootstock and scion material from local fruit tree species
- Diagrams of different graft types
- Handouts on grafting techniques
- Safety goggles

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the biological principles behind grafting
- Identify and describe three basic grafting techniques
- Demonstrate proper selection and preparation of rootstock and scion material
- Perform a basic cleft graft

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Divide students into pairs. Give each pair a piece of fruit (e.g., apple, pear) and ask them to imagine they could combine traits from two different varieties. Have them discuss:
- What traits would they choose to combine?
- How might this benefit farmers or consumers?
Share a few responses with the class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Rootstock
- Scion
- Cambium
- Cleft graft
- Whip and tongue graft
- Side veneer graft

Use visual aids and real plant materials to illustrate these terms.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Biological principles of grafting
   - Explain cambium layer and its role in successful grafting
   - Discuss compatibility between rootstock and scion

2. Types of grafts
   - Demonstrate and explain cleft graft
   - Demonstrate and explain whip and tongue graft
   - Demonstrate and explain side veneer graft

3. Selecting and preparing materials
   - Criteria for choosing healthy rootstock and scion
   - Proper cutting techniques
   - Importance of sanitation

4. Post-grafting care
   - Wrapping and sealing the graft
   - Environmental conditions for healing
   - Monitoring and aftercare

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Rootstock and scion identification exercise
   - Provide various plant materials and have students identify suitable rootstock and scion
   
2. Grafting technique practice
   - In small groups, students practice making cuts for different graft types on practice material (e.g., potato)

## 7. Production Task (60 minutes)

Hands-on grafting workshop:
- Students perform a cleft graft on provided rootstock using local fruit tree species
- Instructor circulates to provide guidance and feedback

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion on challenges encountered during grafting
- Review key points of successful grafting
- Q&A session

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Design a grafting plan for a small orchard (1/4 hectare) using local fruit tree species. Include:
   - Types of rootstock and scion to be used
   - Grafting methods for each combination
   - Timeline for grafting operations
   - Care and management plan post-grafting

2. Research and write a short report (1-2 pages) on a traditional grafting technique used in Timor Leste.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Rootstock: The lower portion of the graft, usually with an established root system, onto which the scion is grafted.
- Scion: The upper portion of the graft, usually a stem with buds, that is grafted onto the rootstock.
- Cambium: The layer of actively dividing cells between the wood and bark of a stem.
- Cleft graft: A grafting method where the scion is inserted into a split in the cut end of the rootstock.
- Whip and tongue graft: A grafting technique where matching cuts are made on both rootstock and scion, which are then fitted together.
- Side veneer graft: A method of grafting where the scion is inserted into a cut made in the side of the rootstock.
