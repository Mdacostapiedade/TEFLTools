## Biological Principles of Grafting

### The Cambium Layer
- Definition: A thin layer of living cells between the wood and bark of trees
- Function: Produces new wood and bark cells
- Key to grafting success: Cambium layers of rootstock and scion must align for union to occur

### Compatibility
- Intraspecific grafting: Within the same species (highest success rate)
- Interspecific grafting: Between closely related species (variable success)
- Intergeneric grafting: Between different genera (rare, limited success)
- Factors affecting compatibility:
  * Genetic similarity
  * Growth rates
  * Vascular anatomy

### Graft Union Formation
1. Alignment of cambium layers
2. Production of callus tissue
3. Differentiation of new vascular tissue
4. Establishment of continuous vascular connection

## Types of Grafts

### Cleft Graft
- Best for: Thick rootstocks (2-10 cm diameter)
- Procedure:
  1. Cut rootstock straight across
  2. Split rootstock down the center
  3. Shape scion into a wedge
  4. Insert scion into the split, aligning cambium layers
  5. Seal and wrap the graft

### Whip and Tongue Graft
- Best for: Thin rootstocks and scions of equal diameter (0.5-2 cm)
- Procedure:
  1. Make matching diagonal cuts on rootstock and scion
  2. Create a tongue cut in both pieces
  3. Interlock the tongues
  4. Wrap and seal the graft

### Side Veneer Graft
- Best for: Rootstocks significantly larger than scions
- Procedure:
  1. Make a long, shallow cut on the side of the rootstock
  2. Cut a matching wedge on the scion
  3. Insert scion into rootstock cut
  4. Secure and seal the graft

## Selecting and Preparing Materials

### Rootstock Selection
- Criteria:
  * Disease resistance
  * Adaptability to local soil conditions
  * Desired tree size and vigor
  * Compatibility with scion variety

### Scion Selection
- Criteria:
  * Disease-free
  * Proper maturity (1-year-old wood)
  * Correct number of buds (3-5)
  * Matching diameter to rootstock (for some graft types)

### Preparation Techniques
- Timing: Collect scion wood during dormancy
- Storage: Keep scions cool and moist until use
- Sanitation: Sterilize tools between cuts
- Cutting technique: Make clean, smooth cuts

## Post-Grafting Care

### Wrapping and Sealing
- Purpose: Prevent desiccation and pathogen entry
- Materials:
  * Grafting tape
  * Rubber bands
  * Grafting wax or sealant

### Environmental Conditions
- Temperature: Maintain 21-27°C (70-80°F)
- Humidity: Keep high (80-90%) to prevent drying
- Light: Provide shade to reduce transpiration

### Monitoring and Aftercare
- Inspect regularly for:
  * Graft union healing
  * Pest or disease issues
  * Rootstock sprouts (remove promptly)
- Gradually reduce humidity and increase light exposure
- Remove wrapping once union is well-established (typically 2-4 weeks)

# Discussion Questions

1. How does understanding the role of the cambium layer inform proper grafting technique?
2. Compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of cleft, whip and tongue, and side veneer grafts.
3. What factors should be considered when selecting rootstock for grafting in Timor Leste's climate?
4. How might grafting techniques be used to improve fruit tree production in local orchards?
5. Discuss potential challenges in post-grafting care specific to Timor Leste's environment and how to address them.
6. How can traditional grafting knowledge in Timor Leste be integrated with modern techniques?
7. What are the ethical considerations in collecting scion material from wild or protected plant species?
