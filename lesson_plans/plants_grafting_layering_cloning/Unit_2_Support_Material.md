# Support Material for Grafting Fundamentals Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Rootstock**: The lower portion of the graft, usually with an established root system, onto which the scion is grafted.
- **Scion**: The upper portion of the graft, usually a stem with buds, that is grafted onto the rootstock.
- **Cambium**: The layer of actively dividing cells between the wood and bark of a stem.
- **Cleft graft**: A grafting method where the scion is inserted into a split in the cut end of the rootstock.
- **Whip and tongue graft**: A grafting technique where matching cuts are made on both rootstock and scion, which are then fitted together.
- **Side veneer graft**: A method of grafting where the scion is inserted into a cut made in the side of the rootstock.
- **Grafting tape**: A specialized tape used to secure and protect the graft union.
- **Grafting wax**: A protective sealant applied to the graft union to prevent moisture loss and infection.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Cambium Layer Diagram:
   - Cross-section of a stem showing bark, wood, and the cambium layer highlighted
   - Caption: "The cambium layer is crucial for successful grafting"

2. Grafting Techniques Comparison:
   - Side-by-side illustrations of cleft, whip and tongue, and side veneer grafts
   - Captions explaining key features of each technique

3. Rootstock and Scion Selection Guide:
   - Images of good vs. poor quality rootstock and scion material
   - Annotations pointing out desirable characteristics

4. Grafting Tools Illustration:
   - Labeled images of grafting knife, pruning shears, grafting tape, and grafting wax
   - Brief descriptions of each tool's use

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Grafting Technique Checklist:
   - Step-by-step instructions for performing a cleft graft
   - Spaces for students to check off each step as completed
   - Section for notes on observations and challenges encountered

2. Rootstock and Scion Matching Exercise:
   - List of local fruit tree species with characteristics of rootstocks and scions
   - Students match compatible pairs and explain their reasoning

3. Post-Grafting Care Guide:
   - Detailed instructions for wrapping, sealing, and caring for newly grafted plants
   - Troubleshooting section for common issues

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "The Grafter's Handbook" by R.J. Garner
2. Online video tutorials on grafting techniques from reputable horticultural institutions
3. Local agricultural extension office resources on grafting native Timor Leste species
4. Scientific papers on rootstock-scion interactions in tropical fruit trees
5. Community gardening groups or farmer cooperatives for hands-on practice opportunities

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with making clean, precise cuts
   - **Tip**: Provide practice materials like soap or potatoes for students to practice cutting techniques before working with actual plant material

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in identifying the cambium layer
   - **Tip**: Use magnifying glasses or prepared microscope slides to help students visualize the cambium layer clearly

3. **Challenge**: Maintaining proper alignment of rootstock and scion
   - **Tip**: Demonstrate the use of alignment tools or guides, and encourage students to work in pairs for extra support

4. **Challenge**: Students becoming frustrated with failed grafts
   - **Tip**: Emphasize that grafting is a skill that improves with practice. Share examples of professional grafters' early attempts and current success rates

5. **Challenge**: Ensuring proper post-grafting care in limited classroom time
   - **Tip**: Set up a "graft nursery" in the classroom or school grounds where students can monitor and care for their grafts over time. Assign rotating care responsibilities

6. **Challenge**: Limited access to diverse plant materials
   - **Tip**: Collaborate with local nurseries or botanical gardens to source a variety of rootstock and scion materials. Consider starting a small school orchard for future grafting projects
