# Lesson Plan: Advanced Grafting Techniques

## 1. Resources Needed

- Grafting knives and pruning shears
- Grafting tape and parafilm
- Potted rootstock plants of local species
- Scion wood from desired varieties
- Grafting wax or sealant
- Diagrams of different grafting techniques
- Samples of successful and failed grafts
- Magnifying glasses or hand lenses
- Notebook and writing materials for students

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the principles of approach grafting and inarching
- Demonstrate the technique of bridge grafting for tree repair
- Identify common grafting problems and their solutions
- Apply grafting techniques to improve plant disease resistance and climate adaptation

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into pairs
- Each pair examines a set of successful and failed graft samples
- Pairs discuss and list possible reasons for success or failure
- Class shares observations and instructor facilitates discussion on critical factors for successful grafting

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  * Approach grafting
  * Inarching
  * Bridge grafting
  * Graft union
  * Cambium alignment
  * Scion preconditioning
- Use visual aids and real plant examples to illustrate concepts

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Approach Grafting and Inarching
- Explain principles and applications
- Demonstrate technique using potted plants
- Discuss advantages for difficult-to-graft species

### Bridge Grafting for Tree Repair
- Explain concept and uses
- Show diagrams of the process
- Demonstrate technique on a damaged tree or mock-up

### Grafting for Disease Resistance and Climate Adaptation
- Discuss selection of resistant rootstocks
- Explain how grafting can improve plant resilience
- Provide examples relevant to Timor Leste's climate challenges

### Troubleshooting Common Grafting Problems
- Present common issues: poor union, incompatibility, disease transmission
- Discuss prevention and solutions for each problem

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

- Students practice approach grafting on potted plants
- In small groups, students attempt a bridge graft on a prepared damaged stem
- Rotate through stations to identify grafting problems on sample plants and propose solutions

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Students select a local plant species and design a grafting strategy to improve its resilience to a specific environmental challenge
- Groups present their strategies to the class for feedback

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Students share one new technique they learned and how they might apply it
- Address any remaining questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research a native Timor Leste plant species that could benefit from advanced grafting techniques
- Write a 1-2 page proposal outlining:
  * The species and its current challenges
  * A grafting strategy to address these challenges
  * Potential benefits to local agriculture or conservation efforts

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Approach grafting: A technique where two plants are grown close together and joined while still attached to their root systems
- Inarching: A form of approach grafting used to provide additional support or change the root system of an established plant
- Bridge grafting: A repair technique used to connect healthy bark above and below a damaged area on a tree trunk
- Graft union: The point where the scion and rootstock join and grow together
- Cambium alignment: Proper positioning of the thin layer of growing tissue in both scion and rootstock to ensure successful union
- Scion preconditioning: Preparing scion wood through techniques like girdling or etiolation to improve grafting success
