## Approach Grafting and Inarching

### Introduction
- Approach grafting: joining two plants while both are on their own roots
- Inarching: variant of approach grafting for established plants
- Useful for difficult-to-graft species or when standard methods fail

### Key Principles
1. Proximity: Plants must be close enough to join without strain
2. Compatibility: Species must be botanically related
3. Timing: Performed during active growth period
4. Cambium contact: Essential for successful union

### Technique
1. Select compatible plants
2. Remove bark strips from areas to be joined
3. Align exposed cambium layers
4. Secure graft with tape or raffia
5. Monitor and maintain moisture
6. Gradually sever original roots/tops once union is established

### Applications in Timor Leste
- Joining canopy species in agroforestry systems
- Improving root systems of established fruit trees
- Propagating rare or endangered native species

## Bridge Grafting for Tree Repair

### Purpose
- Restore cambium connection in damaged trees
- Bypass girdling injuries or disease-affected areas
- Extend lifespan of valuable or historic trees

### Technique
1. Prepare damaged area by cleaning and shaping wound edges
2. Collect scion wood from same tree or compatible variety
3. Insert scions under bark above and below damaged area
4. Secure grafts and seal exposed areas
5. Monitor healing process and adjust as needed

### Considerations
- Multiple scions needed for larger wounds
- Timing crucial - perform in spring as buds begin to swell
- Regular maintenance required for successful healing

## Grafting for Disease Resistance and Climate Adaptation

### Disease Resistance
- Select rootstocks with known resistance to local pathogens
- Examples: 
  * Citrus tristeza virus-resistant rootstocks for citrus
  * Phytophthora-resistant rootstocks for avocado

### Climate Adaptation
- Choose rootstocks adapted to local soil and climate conditions
- Considerations:
  * Drought tolerance
  * Salinity resistance
  * Temperature extremes tolerance

### Process
1. Identify key environmental challenges in Timor Leste
2. Research resistant/adapted rootstock options
3. Test compatibility with desired scion varieties
4. Implement grafting program and monitor results

### Case Studies
- Coffee grafting for leaf rust resistance in Latin America
- Grape rootstock selection for phylloxera resistance globally

## Troubleshooting Common Grafting Problems

### Poor Graft Union
- Causes: Misalignment, inadequate pressure, improper technique
- Solutions: 
  * Ensure proper cambium contact
  * Use appropriate grafting tape or bands
  * Practice proper cutting techniques

### Incompatibility
- Symptoms: Delayed failure, overgrowth at graft union, early leaf drop
- Prevention:
  * Research known compatible combinations
  * Conduct small-scale trials before large implementations

### Disease Transmission
- Risks: Viruses, bacteria, fungi can spread through grafting
- Prevention:
  * Use certified disease-free plant material
  * Sterilize tools between cuts
  * Quarantine new plant material before use in grafting

### Environmental Stress
- Issues: Desiccation, temperature extremes, excessive moisture
- Management:
  * Use grafting wax or sealants
  * Provide appropriate aftercare (shading, humidity control)
  * Time grafting operations to optimal seasonal conditions

# Discussion Questions

1. How might approach grafting be used to improve the productivity of traditional agroforestry systems in Timor Leste?

2. What are the potential risks and benefits of introducing non-native rootstocks for climate adaptation in Timor Leste's agriculture?

3. How can bridge grafting techniques be applied to conserve old-growth trees in Timor Leste's forests?

4. Discuss the ethical considerations of using advanced grafting techniques to modify native plant species for agricultural purposes.

5. How might the knowledge of advanced grafting techniques impact small-scale farmers in Timor Leste? Consider both potential benefits and challenges.

6. What role could advanced grafting play in preserving endangered plant species in Timor Leste?

7. How can we integrate traditional Timorese plant propagation knowledge with these advanced grafting techniques?

8. Discuss potential strategies for disseminating advanced grafting knowledge to rural communities in Timor Leste.

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Case Study Development

1. Choose a native plant species from Timor Leste that faces significant challenges (disease, climate stress, low productivity, etc.).

2. Research the species' current status, importance, and specific challenges.

3. Develop a detailed case study (800-1000 words) that includes:
   - Species description and importance
   - Current challenges faced by the species
   - Proposed grafting strategy to address these challenges
   - Potential impacts of the grafting strategy on local agriculture or conservation
   - Possible implementation plan, including community involvement

4. Include at least three references from scientific literature or local agricultural reports.

5. Conclude with a reflection on how this grafting strategy aligns with sustainable development goals for Timor Leste.

# Assignment Details

## Grafting Technique Demonstration

1. In groups of 3-4, prepare a 15-minute demonstration of an advanced grafting technique covered in this unit.

2. Your demonstration should include:
   - A brief explanation of the technique and its applications
   - Step-by-step demonstration of the grafting process
   - Discussion of critical factors for success
   - Potential challenges and troubleshooting tips
   - A visual aid (poster, handout, or digital presentation) summarizing the technique

3. Use actual plant materials for your demonstration, selecting species relevant to Timor Leste.

4. Be prepared to answer questions from your peers and instructor about your chosen technique.

5. Evaluation will be based on technical accuracy, clarity of explanation, quality of demonstration, and relevance to local context.
