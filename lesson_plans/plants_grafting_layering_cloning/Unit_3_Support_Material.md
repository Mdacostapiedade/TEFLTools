# Support Material for Advanced Grafting Techniques Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Approach grafting**: A technique where two plants are grown close together and joined while still attached to their root systems.
- **Inarching**: A form of approach grafting used to provide additional support or change the root system of an established plant.
- **Bridge grafting**: A repair technique used to connect healthy bark above and below a damaged area on a tree trunk.
- **Graft union**: The point where the scion and rootstock join and grow together.
- **Cambium alignment**: Proper positioning of the thin layer of growing tissue in both scion and rootstock to ensure successful union.
- **Scion preconditioning**: Preparing scion wood through techniques like girdling or etiolation to improve grafting success.
- **Rootstock**: The lower portion of the graft, which forms the root system of the grafted plant.
- **Scion**: The upper portion of the graft, which forms the canopy of the grafted plant.
- **Callus**: Healing tissue that forms at the graft union.
- **Compatibility**: The ability of two plant parts to successfully unite and grow as one plant.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Approach Grafting Diagram**: 
   - Illustration showing two plants growing side by side
   - Arrows indicating where bark is removed from both plants
   - Close-up of how the exposed cambium layers are aligned and bound together

2. **Bridge Grafting Illustration**:
   - Drawing of a tree trunk with a damaged section
   - Multiple scion sticks inserted above and below the damage
   - Arrows showing the direction of nutrient flow around the damaged area

3. **Graft Union Cross-Section**:
   - Detailed drawing of a successful graft union
   - Labels pointing out cambium alignment, callus formation, and vascular connection

4. **Common Grafting Problems Chart**:
   - Side-by-side images of successful and failed grafts
   - Labels identifying issues like poor alignment, incompatibility, and disease

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Grafting Technique Comparison Table**:
   - Columns for approach grafting, inarching, and bridge grafting
   - Rows for technique description, best applications, advantages, and challenges

2. **Grafting Problem-Solving Worksheet**:
   - Scenarios describing various grafting issues
   - Space for students to identify the problem and propose solutions

3. **Grafting for Resilience Planning Sheet**:
   - Template for students to design a grafting strategy for a local plant species
   - Sections for plant description, environmental challenges, proposed grafting technique, and expected benefits

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Hartmann and Kester's Plant Propagation: Principles and Practices (9th Edition)
2. Grafting and Budding: A Practical Guide for Fruit and Nut Plants and Ornamentals by W.J. Lewis and D. McE. Alexander
3. Online course: "Grafting Techniques for Tree Fruits" by Oregon State University Extension
4. YouTube channel: "Grafting Guru" for video demonstrations of various grafting techniques
5. Local agricultural extension office resources on grafting native Timor Leste species

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with fine motor skills required for grafting.
   - **Solution**: Provide extra practice materials and one-on-one guidance. Consider using larger plant materials for initial practice.

2. **Challenge**: Limited availability of suitable local plant materials.
   - **Solution**: Plan ahead and cultivate a variety of rootstocks and scion materials in a school nursery. Partner with local nurseries or botanical gardens for material donations.

3. **Challenge**: Students having difficulty visualizing internal plant structures.
   - **Solution**: Use cross-sectional models or transparencies to demonstrate cambium alignment. Incorporate microscope work to examine plant tissues.

4. **Challenge**: Maintaining proper environmental conditions for graft healing.
   - **Solution**: Set up a dedicated healing chamber or mini-greenhouse in the classroom. Teach students how to monitor and adjust conditions.

5. **Challenge**: Addressing cultural beliefs or practices that may conflict with grafting techniques.
   - **Solution**: Discuss the cultural context of plant propagation in Timor Leste. Invite local elders or traditional practitioners to share knowledge and bridge traditional and modern techniques.
