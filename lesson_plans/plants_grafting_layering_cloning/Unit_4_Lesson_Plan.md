# Lesson Plan: Cloning and Vegetative Propagation

## 1. Resources Needed

- Propagation trays and potting mix
- Rooting hormone powder
- Sharp pruning shears and grafting knives
- Plastic bags and twist ties for air layering
- Various native plant specimens for cuttings
- Misting system or humidity dome
- Handouts on vegetative propagation techniques
- Whiteboard and markers

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the principles of plant cloning
- Demonstrate proper techniques for taking stem, leaf, and root cuttings
- Perform simple and air layering on appropriate plant species
- Set up a propagation environment for cuttings
- Understand the basics of tissue culture propagation

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Divide students into small groups. Give each group a mystery plant cutting and ask them to brainstorm possible methods to propagate it. Have groups share their ideas with the class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Vegetative propagation
- Clone
- Adventitious roots
- Auxin
- Callus
- Meristem
- Totipotency

Use visual aids and examples to illustrate each concept.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### A. Introduction to Plant Cloning
- Definition and importance in horticulture
- Advantages and disadvantages compared to seed propagation

### B. Types of Vegetative Propagation
1. Stem Cuttings
   - Softwood, semi-hardwood, hardwood cuttings
   - Proper cutting techniques and care

2. Leaf Cuttings
   - Suitable species for leaf cuttings
   - Methods: whole leaf, leaf sections, leaf-bud cuttings

3. Root Cuttings
   - Species propagated by root cuttings
   - Timing and technique

4. Layering
   - Simple layering process
   - Air layering technique and applications

5. Tissue Culture (brief overview)
   - Basic principles and applications
   - Advantages in conservation and mass production

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

Divide the class into stations:
1. Stem cutting station: Practice taking softwood and semi-hardwood cuttings
2. Leaf cutting station: Prepare leaf cuttings for propagation
3. Air layering station: Perform air layering on provided plant specimens
4. Propagation setup: Prepare trays with proper media and environmental controls

Rotate groups through each station, allowing hands-on practice with instructor guidance.

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

Students work in pairs to:
- Select a native plant species
- Determine the most appropriate propagation method
- Prepare and set up the propagation according to best practices
- Label and document their work

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion on challenges encountered during practice
- Quick quiz on key concepts covered
- Review of best practices for post-propagation care

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a 1-page report on a tissue culture success story in plant conservation or agriculture.
2. Design a propagation plan for three native Timor Leste plant species, specifying methods and justifying choices.
3. Monitor and record observations of propagation attempts from class over the next two weeks.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Vegetative propagation: The reproduction of plants using vegetative parts rather than seeds
- Clone: A genetically identical copy of a plant
- Adventitious roots: Roots that develop from plant parts other than the normal root system
- Auxin: A plant hormone that promotes root development
- Callus: Undifferentiated tissue that forms on plant wounds
- Meristem: Plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells capable of cell division
- Totipotency: The ability of a plant cell to regenerate into a complete plant
