# Support Material for Cloning and Vegetative Propagation Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Vegetative propagation**: The reproduction of plants using vegetative parts rather than seeds
- **Clone**: A genetically identical copy of a plant
- **Adventitious roots**: Roots that develop from plant parts other than the normal root system
- **Auxin**: A plant hormone that promotes root development
- **Callus**: Undifferentiated tissue that forms on plant wounds
- **Meristem**: Plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells capable of cell division
- **Totipotency**: The ability of a plant cell to regenerate into a complete plant
- **Softwood cutting**: A cutting taken from soft, new growth of a woody plant
- **Semi-hardwood cutting**: A cutting taken from partially matured wood of the current season's growth
- **Hardwood cutting**: A cutting taken from mature, dormant wood of deciduous plants
- **Air layering**: A method of propagation where roots are encouraged to form on a stem while it is still attached to the parent plant

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Stem Cutting Diagram**: A labeled illustration showing the different parts of a stem cutting, including the cut location, leaf removal, and where to apply rooting hormone.

2. **Types of Cuttings Chart**: A visual comparison of softwood, semi-hardwood, and hardwood cuttings, highlighting their characteristics and best times for taking each type.

3. **Air Layering Process**: A step-by-step visual guide showing the air layering process, from wounding the stem to wrapping with moist media and plastic.

4. **Leaf Cutting Methods**: Illustrations of various leaf cutting techniques, including whole leaf, leaf sections, and leaf-bud cuttings.

5. **Propagation Environment Setup**: A diagram of an ideal propagation setup, showing misting system, humidity dome, heating mat, and proper lighting.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Propagation Method Selection Guide**: A decision tree or flowchart helping students choose the most appropriate propagation method based on plant type and available resources.

2. **Cutting Preparation Checklist**: A step-by-step checklist for students to follow when preparing cuttings, ensuring they don't miss any crucial steps.

3. **Propagation Journal Template**: A template for students to record their propagation attempts, including date, plant species, method used, environmental conditions, and observations over time.

4. **Native Plant Propagation Quick Reference**: A table listing common native Timor Leste plants and their recommended propagation methods, timing, and special considerations.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Hartmann and Kester's Plant Propagation: Principles and Practices (9th Edition) by Hudson T. Hartmann, Dale E. Kester, Fred T. Davies Jr., and Robert L. Geneve

2. RHS Propagating Plants by Alan Toogood

3. Online course: "Plant Propagation" by Oregon State University (available on Coursera)

4. Website: PlantPropagation.com - A comprehensive resource for various propagation techniques

5. YouTube channel: "Plant Propagation with Dave" - Practical video tutorials on various propagation methods

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with the dexterity required for delicate cutting techniques.
   **Solution**: Provide practice materials like foam or modeling clay for students to practice cutting techniques before working with actual plants.

2. **Challenge**: Maintaining proper humidity and temperature for cuttings.
   **Solution**: Demonstrate how to create simple humidity chambers using plastic bags or repurposed containers. Emphasize the importance of monitoring and adjusting conditions.

3. **Challenge**: Students becoming discouraged by failed propagation attempts.
   **Solution**: Emphasize that failure is part of the learning process. Encourage documentation of all attempts, successful or not, to learn from the experience.

4. **Challenge**: Limited access to a variety of plant materials for practice.
   **Solution**: Coordinate with local nurseries or botanical gardens for donations or field trips. Encourage students to bring in plants from home or collect responsibly from the wild (with proper permissions).

5. **Challenge**: Ensuring all students get hands-on experience during group activities.
   **Solution**: Implement a rotation system for workstations and assign specific roles within groups to ensure everyone participates actively.

6. **Challenge**: Keeping track of multiple propagation projects over time.
   **Solution**: Set up a class propagation area with clear labeling systems. Assign student teams to monitor and care for projects between classes.
