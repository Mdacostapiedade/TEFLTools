# Lesson Plan: Rootstock and Scion Selection

## 1. Resources Needed

- Samples of various rootstocks and scions
- Grafting tools (grafting knives, pruning shears)
- Microscopes or hand lenses
- Posters or diagrams showing rootstock-scion compatibility
- Handouts on local rootstock characteristics
- Data sheets for rootstock evaluation

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify key characteristics of suitable rootstocks for Timor Leste's conditions
- Explain the importance of rootstock-scion compatibility
- Describe how rootstock selection impacts plant performance
- Evaluate rootstock performance in a local context

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Show images of various plants and ask students to identify which part is the rootstock and which is the scion
- Discuss why grafting is used instead of growing plants from seed

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and define key terms: rootstock, scion, compatibility, vigor, dwarfing
- Use visual aids to illustrate these concepts
- Have students create a vocabulary map connecting these terms

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Characteristics of good rootstock for Timor Leste:
  * Adaptation to local soil conditions
  * Drought tolerance
  * Disease resistance
- Compatibility between rootstock and scion:
  * Genetic relatedness
  * Cambium alignment
  * Growth rate matching
- Influence of rootstock on plant performance:
  * Tree size control
  * Fruit quality
  * Yield
  * Stress tolerance

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

- Small group activity: Match rootstock samples with appropriate scions based on compatibility charts
- Microscope observation: Examine grafted samples to identify the cambium layer and graft union
- Case study analysis: Review local orchard data to determine the impact of different rootstocks on fruit production

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Field trip to local orchard or nursery:
  * Observe different rootstock-scion combinations
  * Interview growers about their rootstock selection criteria
  * Collect data on tree performance for different rootstocks

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Group discussion: Share findings from the field trip
- Quick recap of key points about rootstock selection
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Design an experiment to compare the performance of three different rootstock-scion combinations for a locally important fruit tree
- Write a 1-page proposal outlining the experiment design, including:
  * Hypothesis
  * Materials needed
  * Methods
  * Data collection plan
  * Expected outcomes

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Rootstock: The lower portion of a grafted plant that forms the root system
- Scion: The upper portion of a grafted plant that forms the canopy
- Compatibility: The ability of a rootstock and scion to form a successful graft union
- Vigor: The growth rate and overall health of a plant
- Dwarfing: The ability of a rootstock to reduce the size of the grafted tree
- Cambium: The layer of actively dividing cells between the wood and bark of a tree
- Graft union: The point where the rootstock and scion join in a grafted plant
