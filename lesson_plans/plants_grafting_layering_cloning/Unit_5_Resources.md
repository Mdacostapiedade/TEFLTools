## Characteristics of Good Rootstock for Timor Leste

### Adaptation to Local Soil Conditions
- Timor Leste soil types: predominantly clay and limestone-derived soils
- Key soil factors: pH (often alkaline), drainage, nutrient content
- Rootstock traits for adaptation:
  * Deep root systems for water access
  * Tolerance to high pH (7.5-8.5)
  * Efficient nutrient uptake in low-fertility soils

### Drought Tolerance
- Timor Leste climate: distinct wet and dry seasons
- Rootstock traits for drought tolerance:
  * Extensive root systems
  * Efficient water use
  * Stomatal control
- Examples of drought-tolerant rootstocks:
  * Citrus: Swingle citrumelo, Cleopatra mandarin
  * Mango: Kensington polyembryonic seedlings

### Disease Resistance
- Common soil-borne diseases in Timor Leste:
  * Phytophthora root rot
  * Fusarium wilt
  * Nematodes
- Rootstock traits for disease resistance:
  * Genetic resistance to specific pathogens
  * Vigorous root growth
  * Induced systemic resistance

## Compatibility Between Rootstock and Scion

### Genetic Relatedness
- Importance of taxonomic closeness
- Compatibility spectrum:
  * Intraspecific (same species): highest compatibility
  * Interspecific (same genus): variable compatibility
  * Intergeneric (different genera): lowest compatibility
- Examples of compatible combinations in Timor Leste:
  * Mango: Carabao scion on Kensington rootstock
  * Citrus: Valencia orange scion on Rangpur lime rootstock

### Cambium Alignment
- Role of cambium in graft union formation
- Techniques for ensuring proper alignment:
  * Matching diameters of rootstock and scion
  * Clean, angled cuts
  * Proper grafting technique (e.g., whip and tongue, cleft graft)

### Growth Rate Matching
- Importance of balanced growth between rootstock and scion
- Consequences of mismatched growth rates:
  * Overgrowth or undergrowth at graft union
  * Reduced nutrient and water flow
  * Potential graft failure
- Strategies for matching growth rates:
  * Selection of rootstocks with similar vigor to scion
  * Use of interstems for extreme mismatches

## Influence of Rootstock on Plant Performance

### Tree Size Control
- Dwarfing rootstocks:
  * Advantages: higher planting density, easier harvesting
  * Examples: M9 for apples, Flying Dragon for citrus
- Vigor-inducing rootstocks:
  * Advantages: faster establishment, higher individual tree yield
  * Examples: seedling mango rootstocks, rough lemon for citrus

### Fruit Quality
- Rootstock effects on:
  * Sugar content (Brix)
  * Acidity
  * Fruit size and shape
  * Peel characteristics
- Examples:
  * Citrus: Trifoliate orange rootstock improves fruit quality in mandarins
  * Mango: Polyembryonic rootstocks can affect fruit fiber content

### Yield
- Rootstock influence on:
  * Precocity (early bearing)
  * Fruit set and retention
  * Alternate bearing tendency
- Examples:
  * Apple: M26 rootstock induces earlier bearing compared to seedling rootstocks
  * Avocado: Clonal rootstocks can increase yield consistency

### Stress Tolerance
- Rootstock-mediated tolerance to:
  * Salinity
  * Waterlogging
  * Nutrient deficiencies
  * Temperature extremes
- Examples:
  * Citrus: Cleopatra mandarin rootstock improves cold tolerance
  * Mango: Gomera-3 rootstock enhances salinity tolerance
