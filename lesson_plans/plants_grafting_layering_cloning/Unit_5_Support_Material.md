Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Rootstock and Scion Selection, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Rootstock and Scion Selection Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Rootstock: The lower portion of a grafted plant that forms the root system
- Scion: The upper portion of a grafted plant that forms the canopy
- Compatibility: The ability of a rootstock and scion to form a successful graft union
- Vigor: The growth rate and overall health of a plant
- Dwarfing: The ability of a rootstock to reduce the size of the grafted tree
- Cambium: The layer of actively dividing cells between the wood and bark of a tree
- Graft union: The point where the rootstock and scion join in a grafted plant
- Adaptation: The process by which a plant becomes better suited to its environment
- Drought tolerance: The ability of a plant to withstand periods of limited water availability
- Disease resistance: The ability of a plant to resist or tolerate pathogens

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Rootstock-Scion Diagram:
   - A simple illustration showing a tree with the rootstock portion below ground and the scion portion above ground, clearly labeled.

2. Compatibility Chart:
   - A matrix showing common rootstocks on one axis and scions on the other, with color-coded cells indicating compatibility levels (high, medium, low).

3. Cambium Layer Close-up:
   - A cross-section diagram of a stem showing the location of the cambium layer between the wood and bark.

4. Rootstock Influence Infographic:
   - A visual representation showing how rootstock affects tree size, fruit quality, yield, and stress tolerance.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Rootstock Evaluation Sheet:
   - A table for students to fill out during field observations, including columns for rootstock variety, observed characteristics (e.g., vigor, disease resistance), and notes on tree performance.

2. Rootstock-Scion Matching Exercise:
   - A worksheet with lists of rootstocks and scions, asking students to draw lines connecting compatible pairs based on provided information.

3. Case Study Analysis Guide:
   - A structured worksheet guiding students through the analysis of local orchard data, including prompts for identifying trends and drawing conclusions about rootstock performance.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Rootstock Basics for Fruit Trees" - University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources publication
2. "Grafting and Budding Fruit Trees" - Penn State Extension guide
3. "Rootstock Effects on Fruit Tree Physiology" - Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science (selected articles)
4. Online rootstock selection tool for common fruit trees (if available for Timor Leste's specific conditions)
5. Video tutorials on grafting techniques and rootstock selection from reputable agricultural extension services

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggle to understand compatibility concepts
   - Solution: Use physical models or puzzles to demonstrate how different rootstocks and scions fit together.

2. Challenge: Limited access to diverse rootstock samples
   - Solution: Create a "rootstock library" with preserved samples or high-quality photographs from various sources.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in observing long-term effects of rootstock selection
   - Solution: Utilize case studies and long-term data from established orchards to illustrate outcomes.

4. Challenge: Students have varying levels of prior knowledge
   - Solution: Implement a pre-lesson assessment and use peer teaching to balance knowledge levels.

5. Challenge: Limited field trip opportunities
   - Solution: Develop a virtual tour using videos and photos from local orchards, or invite guest speakers from the industry.

6. Challenge: Connecting theoretical knowledge to practical application
   - Solution: Incorporate role-playing exercises where students act as orchard managers making rootstock selection decisions.

7. Challenge: Maintaining student engagement during technical discussions
   - Solution: Use interactive tools like online quizzes or mobile apps to break up lecture portions of the lesson.
