# Lesson Plan: Nursery Management for Propagation

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on nursery layout designs
- Sample propagation materials (trays, pots, growing media)
- Basic nursery tools (watering cans, pruning shears, thermometers)
- Images or videos of various nursery setups

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Design a basic layout for a small-scale nursery
- Identify essential components of a propagation environment
- Explain best practices for plant care in a nursery setting
- Describe common pest and disease management strategies for nurseries

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Ask each group to brainstorm and list the essential elements they think a plant nursery needs
- Have groups share their ideas with the class and compile a master list on the whiteboard

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Propagation environment
- Mist system
- Humidity chamber
- Integrated pest management (IPM)
- Hardening off

Use visual aids or demonstrations where possible to illustrate these concepts.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Nursery Layout and Infrastructure
- Discuss optimal nursery layouts for different purposes (e.g., commercial vs. conservation)
- Cover essential infrastructure: irrigation systems, shade structures, work areas
- Explain the importance of proper drainage and air circulation

### Propagation Environments
- Detail the functions and setup of mist systems and humidity chambers
- Discuss temperature and humidity control in propagation areas
- Explain the concept of microclimate management within a nursery

### Plant Care in the Nursery
- Cover watering practices, including frequency and methods
- Discuss fertilization strategies for young plants
- Explain the process of hardening off plants before transplanting

### Pest and Disease Management
- Introduce the concept of Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
- Discuss common nursery pests and diseases in Timor Leste
- Cover preventive measures and treatment options

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Divide the class into small groups
- Provide each group with a scenario (e.g., "Design a nursery for propagating native fruit trees")
- Have groups sketch a basic nursery layout and list key components
- Groups present their designs to the class for feedback

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

- Students work individually to develop a detailed propagation protocol for a specific native endangered species of Timor Leste
- Protocol should include nursery setup, propagation method, care requirements, and pest management strategies
- Encourage students to consider local climate and resource availability in their protocols

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Conduct a brief quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Address any questions or misconceptions
- Summarize the main points of nursery management for propagation

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 2-page report on a successful nursery operation in Timor Leste or a neighboring country
- Include analysis of their nursery layout, propagation techniques, and management practices
- Suggest how these practices could be applied or adapted for a small-scale community nursery project

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Propagation environment: A controlled setting designed to optimize plant growth and reproduction
- Mist system: An irrigation method that uses fine water droplets to maintain high humidity for cuttings or seedlings
- Humidity chamber: An enclosed space used to maintain high humidity levels for sensitive plants or cuttings
- Integrated Pest Management (IPM): A holistic approach to pest control that uses multiple strategies to minimize chemical interventions
- Hardening off: The process of gradually exposing nursery plants to outdoor conditions to prepare them for transplanting
