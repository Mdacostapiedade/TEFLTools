# Lecture Notes

## Nursery Layout and Infrastructure

### Optimal Nursery Layouts
- Commercial nurseries: Focus on efficiency and production
  * Linear bed arrangements for easy access
  * Separate areas for propagation, growing, and hardening off
  * Centralized irrigation and work areas
- Conservation nurseries: Prioritize species diversity and research
  * Modular design with separate zones for different species or ecosystems
  * Dedicated areas for rare or sensitive species
  * Emphasis on natural shade and microclimate creation

### Essential Infrastructure
1. Irrigation systems
   - Overhead sprinklers for general watering
   - Drip irrigation for water conservation
   - Mist systems for propagation areas
2. Shade structures
   - Permanent structures (e.g., shade houses with varying mesh densities)
   - Temporary shading (e.g., shade cloth on adjustable frames)
3. Work areas
   - Potting benches with storage for tools and materials
   - Soil mixing and storage area
   - Propagation preparation space

### Proper Drainage and Air Circulation
- Importance:
  * Prevents waterlogging and root diseases
  * Reduces humidity-related fungal issues
  * Promotes stronger root development
- Implementation:
  * Raised beds or benches for container plants
  * Proper soil mix with adequate porosity
  * Strategic placement of fans for air movement

## Propagation Environments

### Mist Systems
- Function: Maintain high humidity for cuttings without waterlogging
- Setup:
  * Fine mist nozzles on overhead pipes
  * Timer-controlled to provide frequent, short bursts of mist
  * Adjustable based on plant needs and environmental conditions

### Humidity Chambers
- Function: Create a high-humidity microenvironment for sensitive plants or difficult-to-root cuttings
- Setup:
  * Enclosed structure (e.g., clear plastic over a frame)
  * Humidity control through misting or manual spraying
  * Ventilation options to prevent excessive moisture

### Temperature and Humidity Control
- Monitoring tools: Thermometers, hygrometers
- Control methods:
  * Shade cloth or paint for temperature reduction
  * Evaporative cooling systems
  * Heating mats for root zone warming
  * Fogging systems for humidity increase

### Microclimate Management
- Creating varied environments within the nursery
- Techniques:
  * Strategic placement of plants based on light and temperature needs
  * Use of reflective surfaces or heat-absorbing materials
  * Grouping plants with similar environmental requirements

## Plant Care in the Nursery

### Watering Practices
- Frequency: Based on plant species, growth stage, and environmental conditions
- Methods:
  * Hand watering for precision and monitoring
  * Automated systems for consistency and labor reduction
- Best practices:
  * Water early in the day to reduce fungal issues
  * Avoid overwatering by checking soil moisture regularly

### Fertilization Strategies
- Types of fertilizers:
  * Slow-release granular fertilizers for long-term feeding
  * Liquid fertilizers for quick nutrient uptake
- Application methods:
  * Incorporation into potting mix
  * Top-dressing for established plants
  * Foliar feeding for micronutrients
- Considerations:
  * Adjust fertilization based on plant growth stage and species requirements
  * Monitor for signs of nutrient deficiencies or excesses

### Hardening Off Process
- Purpose: Acclimatize nursery-grown plants to outdoor conditions
- Steps:
  1. Gradual exposure to direct sunlight
  2. Reduction in watering frequency
  3. Exposure to temperature fluctuations
  4. Increased air movement
- Timeline: Typically 1-2 weeks, depending on species and conditions

## Pest and Disease Management

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
- Definition: A holistic approach combining biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to manage pests and diseases
- Key components:
  1. Prevention
  2. Monitoring
  3. Identification
  4. Action thresholds
  5. Control methods
  6. Evaluation

### Common Nursery Pests and Diseases in Timor Leste
- Pests:
  * Aphids
  * Whiteflies
  * Mealybugs
  * Spider mites
- Diseases:
  * Root rot (Phytophthora spp.)
  * Powdery mildew
  * Leaf spot diseases
  * Viral infections

### Preventive Measures
- Sanitation practices:
  * Sterilization of tools and containers
  * Removal of dead or diseased plant material
- Cultural controls:
  * Proper spacing for air circulation
  * Appropriate watering practices
  * Use of disease-resistant varieties
- Physical barriers:
  * Insect screens on greenhouse openings
  * Sticky traps for monitoring and control

### Treatment Options
- Biological controls:
  * Beneficial insects (e.g., ladybugs, lacewings)
  * Microbial pesticides (e.g., Bacillus thuringiensis)
- Chemical controls:
  * Insecticidal soaps and horticultural oils
  * Selective pesticides when necessary
  * Proper timing and application methods to minimize environmental impact

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the layout of a nursery impact its efficiency and plant health? Discuss the key considerations when designing a nursery layout for Timor Leste's climate.

2. Compare and contrast the use of mist systems and humidity chambers in plant propagation. In what situations would you choose one over the other?

3. Discuss the challenges of maintaining optimal temperature and humidity levels in a nursery in Timor Leste. What innovative solutions could be implemented to address these challenges?

4. How does the concept of microclimate management apply to nursery operations? Provide examples of how you might create and utilize microclimates within a nursery setting.
