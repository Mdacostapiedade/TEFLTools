Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Nursery Management for Propagation, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Nursery Management for Propagation Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Propagation environment**: A controlled setting designed to optimize plant growth and reproduction.
- **Mist system**: An irrigation method that uses fine water droplets to maintain high humidity for cuttings or seedlings.
- **Humidity chamber**: An enclosed space used to maintain high humidity levels for sensitive plants or cuttings.
- **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**: A holistic approach to pest control that uses multiple strategies to minimize chemical interventions.
- **Hardening off**: The process of gradually exposing nursery plants to outdoor conditions to prepare them for transplanting.
- **Microclimate**: A local set of atmospheric conditions that differ from those in the surrounding areas.
- **Growing media**: Materials used to grow plants, providing support, nutrients, and moisture retention.
- **Fertigation**: The application of fertilizers, soil amendments, or other water-soluble products through an irrigation system.
- **Shade cloth**: A woven or knitted fabric used to reduce light intensity and heat in nurseries.
- **Rootstock**: The root system and lower part of the stem onto which a scion is grafted.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Nursery Layout Diagram**: A top-down view of an ideal small-scale nursery layout, including:
   - Propagation area with mist system
   - Hardening off area
   - Potting and work area
   - Storage for tools and supplies
   - Irrigation system layout
   - Shade structures

2. **Mist System Illustration**: A detailed drawing showing:
   - Mist nozzles and their arrangement
   - Water supply and pump
   - Timer and control system
   - Typical plant arrangement under the system

3. **IPM Strategy Flowchart**: A visual representation of the IPM decision-making process, including:
   - Monitoring steps
   - Threshold levels
   - Control options (cultural, biological, chemical)
   - Evaluation and adjustment

4. **Hardening Off Timeline**: A graphical representation of the hardening off process over time, showing:
   - Gradual increase in light exposure
   - Reduction in watering frequency
   - Temperature acclimation steps

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Nursery Design Worksheet**:
   - Grid paper for sketching nursery layout
   - Checklist of essential nursery components
   - Space for listing local climate considerations
   - Questions prompting students to justify their design choices

2. **Plant Care Schedule Template**:
   - Table with columns for plant species, watering frequency, fertilization schedule, and special care notes
   - Blank rows for students to fill in based on local plant species

3. **IPM Decision Guide**:
   - Flowchart for identifying common pests and diseases
   - Table of environmentally friendly treatment options
   - Space for students to add local pest management strategies

4. **Propagation Protocol Template**:
   - Structured format for students to detail propagation steps for a specific species
   - Sections for materials needed, environmental conditions, care instructions, and troubleshooting tips

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "The Reference Manual of Woody Plant Propagation" by Michael A. Dirr and Charles W. Heuser Jr.
2. "Plant Propagation: Principles and Practices" by Hudson T. Hartmann et al.
3. Online course: "Plant Propagation" by Oregon State University (available on Coursera)
4. Website: Tropical Nursery Manual by the USDA Forest Service (https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_series/wo/wo_ah730.pdf)
5. Local resource: Timor-Leste Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries publications on native plant propagation (if available)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Limited resources**: 
   - Encourage improvisation with locally available materials
   - Partner with local nurseries or agricultural organizations for field trips or resource sharing

2. **Varied student experience levels**: 
   - Use peer teaching by pairing experienced students with beginners
   - Provide additional support materials for students needing extra help

3. **Language barriers with technical terms**: 
   - Create a visual glossary with images representing key concepts
   - Use local plant names alongside scientific names when possible

4. **Lack of hands-on experience**: 
   - Incorporate as many practical activities as possible, even if on a small scale
   - Use video demonstrations when live demonstrations aren't feasible

5. **Adapting content to local context**: 
   - Research and incorporate traditional propagation methods used in Timor-Leste
   - Invite local experts or elders to share knowledge on native plant propagation

6. **Maintaining plant material**: 
   - Establish a small nursery area at the teaching facility if possible
   - Develop relationships with local nurseries or botanical gardens for plant donations or visits

7. **Addressing climate change concerns**: 
   - Discuss how propagation techniques can contribute to climate resilience
   - Encourage students to consider future climate scenarios in their nursery designs
