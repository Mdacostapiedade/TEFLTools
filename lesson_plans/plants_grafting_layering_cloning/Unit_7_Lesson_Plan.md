# Lesson Plan: Conservation and Restoration Applications

## 1. Resources Needed

- Grafting and propagation tools (knives, pruning shears, rooting hormones)
- Potting soil, containers, and watering equipment
- Native plant specimens for propagation
- Field guides to native plants of Timor Leste
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on ex situ conservation techniques
- Materials for creating educational posters

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the role of plant propagation in conservation and restoration efforts
- Apply appropriate propagation techniques for preserving native plant species
- Develop a basic conservation plan for a rare native species
- Understand ethical considerations in plant collection and propagation

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show images of degraded ecosystems in Timor Leste
- Ask students to brainstorm in small groups:
  1. What caused this degradation?
  2. How might propagation techniques help restore these areas?
- Share ideas with the class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  - Ex situ conservation
  - In situ conservation
  - Genetic diversity
  - Ecosystem restoration
  - Endangered species
- Have students create a vocabulary map connecting these terms

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Lecture and discussion on:
  1. Ex situ conservation through propagation
     - Definition and importance
     - Techniques for preserving genetic diversity
  2. Restoration of degraded ecosystems
     - Selecting appropriate species for restoration
     - Propagation methods for restoration projects
  3. Ethical considerations in plant collection and propagation
     - Sustainable collection practices
     - Importance of maintaining genetic diversity

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

- Divide class into small groups
- Each group selects a native endangered plant species
- Groups research and outline a propagation plan for their chosen species, considering:
  1. Appropriate propagation techniques
  2. Ex situ conservation strategies
  3. Potential for use in ecosystem restoration

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Groups create an educational poster on their chosen species and conservation plan
- Posters should include:
  1. Information about the species and its ecological importance
  2. Propagation techniques to be used
  3. Ex situ conservation strategies
  4. Plans for reintroduction or ecosystem restoration

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Each group presents their poster to the class (2-3 minutes each)
- Class discussion on common themes and challenges identified
- Recap key points of the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students write a 1-2 page reflection on:
  1. The importance of plant propagation in conservation efforts
  2. Ethical considerations they would face in collecting and propagating rare species
  3. How they might apply these concepts in their local community

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Ex situ conservation: The process of protecting an endangered species outside its natural habitat
- In situ conservation: The conservation of species in their natural habitats
- Genetic diversity: The total number of genetic characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species
- Ecosystem restoration: The process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed
- Endangered species: A species at risk of extinction because of human activity, changes in climate, changes in predator-prey ratios, etc.
