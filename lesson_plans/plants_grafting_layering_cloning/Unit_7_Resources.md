# Lecture Notes

## Ex situ Conservation through Propagation

### Definition and Importance
- Ex situ conservation: preservation of species outside their natural habitats
- Crucial for species threatened with extinction in the wild
- Allows for controlled breeding and genetic management
- Provides backup populations for potential reintroduction

### Techniques for Preserving Genetic Diversity
- Seed banking: collecting and storing seeds from diverse populations
- Living collections: maintaining plants in botanical gardens or specialized facilities
- Tissue culture: preserving plant material in sterile laboratory conditions
- Cryopreservation: freezing plant tissues or seeds for long-term storage

### Application in Timor Leste
- Focus on endemic species at risk due to habitat loss or climate change
- Examples: Sandalwood (Santalum album), Eucalyptus urophylla, Pterocarpus indicus

## Restoration of Degraded Ecosystems

### Selecting Appropriate Species for Restoration
- Consider native species adapted to local conditions
- Assess ecological roles: pioneer species, keystone species, etc.
- Evaluate potential for erosion control, soil improvement, and wildlife habitat

### Propagation Methods for Restoration Projects
- Seed propagation: collecting, storing, and germinating seeds
- Vegetative propagation: cuttings, layering, division
- Advanced techniques: tissue culture for rare species

### Case Studies in Timor Leste
- Mangrove restoration along coastal areas
- Reforestation of degraded hillsides with native tree species

## Ethical Considerations in Plant Collection and Propagation

### Sustainable Collection Practices
- Obtain necessary permits and permissions
- Limit collection to ensure population viability
- Document collection sites and methods

### Importance of Maintaining Genetic Diversity
- Collect from multiple populations and individuals
- Avoid over-representation of certain genotypes
- Implement breeding programs to maintain genetic variability

### Cultural Considerations
- Respect traditional knowledge and practices
- Engage local communities in conservation efforts
- Ensure equitable benefit-sharing from plant resources

# Discussion Questions

1. How can ex situ conservation complement in situ conservation efforts in Timor Leste?
2. What are the main challenges in preserving genetic diversity of native plant species in Timor Leste, and how can they be addressed?
3. How might climate change impact the selection of species for ecosystem restoration in Timor Leste?
4. What ethical dilemmas might arise when collecting rare plant species for conservation, and how would you address them?
5. How can traditional ecological knowledge be integrated into conservation and restoration efforts in Timor Leste?
6. What are the potential risks and benefits of using advanced propagation techniques (e.g., tissue culture) for conservation of native species?
7. How can we balance the need for ex situ conservation with the goal of maintaining species in their natural habitats?
8. What role can community engagement play in successful ecosystem restoration projects?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Conservation Plan for a Rare Native Species

1. Select a rare native plant species from Timor Leste.
2. Research its current status, habitat requirements, and threats.
3. Develop a comprehensive conservation plan that includes:
   a. Ex situ conservation strategies
   b. Propagation techniques suitable for the species
   c. Plans for maintaining genetic diversity
   d. Potential for reintroduction or habitat restoration
   e. Community engagement and education components
4. Write a 3-4 page report detailing your conservation plan.
5. Include a bibliography of at least 5 scientific sources.

# Assignment Details

## Participate in a Local Restoration Project

1. Students will participate in a one-day restoration project at a local degraded site.
2. Prior to the field day, research the site's history, current conditions, and restoration goals.
3. During the field day:
   a. Assist in planting propagated native species
   b. Document the process through photographs and notes
   c. Interact with project leaders to understand the long-term restoration plan
4. After the field day, prepare a 2-page reflection report including:
   a. Description of the restoration site and project goals
   b. Propagation methods used for the planted species
   c. Challenges encountered and how they were addressed
   d. Personal insights and lessons learned
   e. Suggestions for future restoration efforts

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Sandalwood (Santalum album) Conservation in Timor Leste

### Background
- Sandalwood: culturally and economically important species
- Overharvesting led to significant population decline
- Current conservation efforts focus on both in situ and ex situ approaches

### Ex situ Conservation Strategies
1. Seed banking
   - Collection from remnant wild populations
   - Storage in temperature-controlled facilities
2. Living collections
   - Establishment of sandalwood plantations
   - Maintenance of diverse genetic stock
3. Tissue culture
   - Development of protocols for micropropagation
   - Production of disease-free planting material

### Propagation Techniques
1. Seed propagation
   - Pre-treatment methods to improve germination
   - Nursery management for seedlings
2. Vegetative propagation
   - Root cuttings and air layering
   - Grafting onto resistant rootstocks

### Restoration and Sustainable Use
- Reintroduction to suitable habitats
- Integration into agroforestry systems
- Development of sustainable harvesting guidelines

### Challenges and Considerations
- Slow growth rate of sandalwood
- Need for host plants in cultivation
- Balancing conservation with economic utilization

This case study provides a concrete example of applying conservation and propagation techniques to a culturally significant species in Timor Leste, illustrating the integration of scientific methods with local needs and practices.
