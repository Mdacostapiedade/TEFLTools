Here are the support materials for the Conservation and Restoration Applications lesson:

# Support Materials for Conservation and Restoration Applications Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Ex situ conservation: The process of protecting an endangered species outside its natural habitat
- In situ conservation: The conservation of species in their natural habitats
- Genetic diversity: The total number of genetic characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species
- Ecosystem restoration: The process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed
- Endangered species: A species at risk of extinction because of human activity, changes in climate, changes in predator-prey ratios, etc.
- Propagation: The breeding of specimens of a plant or animal by natural processes from the parent stock
- Native species: A species that occurs naturally in a particular region, ecosystem, or habitat
- Biodiversity: The variety of life in the world or in a particular habitat or ecosystem

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Ecosystem Degradation and Restoration Cycle:
   A circular diagram showing:
   - Healthy ecosystem
   - Factors leading to degradation (e.g., deforestation, pollution)
   - Degraded ecosystem
   - Restoration efforts (including propagation)
   - Recovered ecosystem

2. Ex Situ vs. In Situ Conservation Comparison:
   A side-by-side comparison showing:
   - Ex situ: botanical gardens, seed banks, nurseries
   - In situ: protected areas, national parks, wildlife reserves

3. Propagation Techniques Flowchart:
   A flowchart depicting different propagation methods:
   - Seed propagation
   - Cutting propagation
   - Grafting
   - Tissue culture

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Species Conservation Plan Worksheet:
   - Species name and description
   - Current conservation status
   - Threats to the species
   - Propagation techniques suitable for the species
   - Ex situ conservation strategies
   - In situ conservation strategies
   - Restoration potential

2. Ethical Considerations Checklist:
   - Sustainable collection practices
   - Maintaining genetic diversity
   - Avoiding introduction of invasive species
   - Respecting local communities and traditional knowledge
   - Ensuring equitable access and benefit-sharing

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Books:
   - "Plant Conservation: Why It Matters and How It Works" by Timothy Walker
   - "Ex Situ Plant Conservation: Supporting Species Survival in the Wild" edited by Edward O. Guerrant Jr., Kayri Havens, and Mike Maunder

2. Online Resources:
   - IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (www.iucnredlist.org)
   - Botanic Gardens Conservation International (www.bgci.org)
   - Convention on Biological Diversity (www.cbd.int)

3. Local Resources:
   - Timor Leste National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan
   - Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of Timor Leste website

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited access to endangered species for hands-on learning
   Solution: Use common native species as proxies for endangered species in propagation activities. Utilize photos, videos, and case studies of endangered species conservation efforts.

2. Challenge: Students may struggle with the complexity of conservation planning
   Solution: Break down the conservation plan into smaller, manageable steps. Provide examples and templates to guide students through the process.

3. Challenge: Ethical considerations may be abstract for some students
   Solution: Use real-world scenarios and role-playing exercises to make ethical dilemmas more concrete and relatable.

4. Challenge: Limited resources for propagation activities
   Solution: Focus on low-tech propagation methods that can be done with minimal equipment. Partner with local nurseries or botanical gardens for access to more resources.

5. Challenge: Connecting classroom learning to real-world conservation efforts
   Solution: Invite local conservation practitioners as guest speakers. Organize field trips to ongoing restoration projects or ex situ conservation facilities.
