# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Aristotle's Poetics (Excerpt)

"Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude; in language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play; in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper purgation of these emotions.

[...]

Most important of all is the structure of the incidents. For Tragedy is an imitation, not of men, but of an action and of life, and life consists in action, and its end is a mode of action, not a quality. Now character determines men's qualities, but it is by their actions that they are happy or the reverse. Dramatic action, therefore, is not with a view to the representation of character: character comes in as subsidiary to the actions. Hence the incidents and the plot are the end of a tragedy; and the end is the chief thing of all. Again, without action there cannot be a tragedy; there may be without character."

## Traditional Timorese Folktale: "The Crocodile and the Boy"

Long ago, when the land of Timor was still young, there lived a boy who loved to swim in the cool rivers that flowed through the lush forests. One day, as he was swimming, he came across a crocodile stranded on a sandbank. The crocodile was weak and hungry, unable to return to the water.

The boy, feeling pity for the creature, decided to help. He pushed and pulled with all his might until the crocodile was back in the water. Grateful for the boy's kindness, the crocodile offered to take him on a journey across the sea.

As they swam together, the crocodile began to feel hungry again. He thought about eating the boy but remembered the kindness shown to him. The crocodile's conscience spoke, reminding him of the debt he owed the boy.

They swam for days and nights, and as they traveled, the crocodile's body grew larger and larger. Finally, they reached a beautiful island. The boy stepped onto the shore, amazed by the lush landscape before him.

The crocodile, exhausted from the long journey, fell into a deep sleep. As he slept, his body continued to grow until it became the island of Timor itself. The boy became the ancestor of the Timorese people, who have lived on the island ever since.

To this day, the Timorese people remember this legend and treat crocodiles with respect, seeing them as their ancestors and protectors of the land.

# Lecture Notes

## Introduction to Aristotle's Poetics

1. Historical context
   - Written around 335 BCE
   - One of the earliest works of dramatic theory
   - Influenced Western literature for centuries

2. Key concepts in Poetics
   - Mimesis (imitation of life)
   - Catharsis (emotional purification)
   - Unity of action, time, and place

3. Six elements of tragedy (in order of importance)
   a. Plot (mythos)
   b. Character (ethos)
   c. Thought (dianoia)
   d. Diction (lexis)
   e. Melody (melos)
   f. Spectacle (opsis)

4. Emphasis on plot
   - Actions are more important than characters
   - Plot should be "complete and whole"
   - Events should follow logically and necessarily

## The Three-Act Structure

1. Act I: Setup (25% of the story)
   - Introduce main characters
   - Establish the world of the story
   - Present the inciting incident

2. Act II: Confrontation (50% of the story)
   - Develop conflicts and obstacles
   - Raise the stakes
   - Lead to a midpoint reversal or revelation

3. Act III: Resolution (25% of the story)
   - Build to the climax
   - Resolve the main conflict
   - Tie up loose ends in the denouement

4. Key plot points
   - Inciting incident
   - Plot point 1 (end of Act I)
   - Midpoint
   - Plot point 2 (end of Act II)
   - Climax

## Traditional Timorese Storytelling Techniques

1. Oral tradition
   - Stories passed down through generations
   - Importance of memory and performance

   - Keeper of cultural knowledge and history

3. Common themes in Timorese stories
   - Origin myths
   - Ancestral legends
   - Moral tales
   - Nature and animal stories

4. Storytelling techniques
   - Use of repetition and rhythm
   - Incorporation of local languages and dialects
   - Interactive elements (call and response, audience participation)
   - Integration of music and dance

5. Cultural significance
   - Preservation of history and traditions
   - Teaching of moral and social values
   - Strengthening community bonds

# Discussion Questions

## Aristotle's Poetics and Three-Act Structure

1. How does Aristotle's emphasis on plot over character compare to modern storytelling preferences?
2. In what ways might the three-act structure be limiting or beneficial for playwrights?
3. Can you think of any plays or films that successfully deviate from the three-act structure? How do they achieve this?

## Traditional Timorese Storytelling

1. How do the themes in Timorese folktales reflect the culture and values of Timor-Leste?
2. In what ways can traditional storytelling techniques be incorporated into modern playwriting?
3. How might the role of the storyteller in Timorese culture inform the way we think about playwrights and theatre creators?

## Comparing Western and Timorese Storytelling

1. What similarities and differences do you notice between the three-act structure and the structure of "The Crocodile and the Boy"?
2. How might Aristotle's concepts of mimesis and catharsis apply to traditional Timorese stories?
3. In what ways can Timorese playwrights blend Western dramatic theory with local storytelling traditions?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Short Scene Based on a Local Legend

1. Choose a local Timorese legend or folktale as inspiration.
2. Identify the key dramatic elements in the story (protagonist, antagonist, conflict, etc.).
3. Structure your scene using the three-act model, even if in a condensed form:
   - Begin with a brief setup (exposition)
   - Develop the conflict (rising action)
   - End with a climax or cliffhanger
4. Incorporate at least one traditional Timorese storytelling technique (e.g., repetition, audience interaction, or integration of music/dance).
5. Write a 2-3 page scene (approximately 500-750 words).
6. Pay attention to dialogue, stage directions, and character development.
