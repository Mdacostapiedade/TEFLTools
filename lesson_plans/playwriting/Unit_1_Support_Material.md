## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to identify dramatic elements in Timorese folktales.
   **Solution**: Provide a simple, step-by-step guide for analyzing stories. Start with more obvious elements like characters and setting before moving to more complex concepts like theme and structure.

2. **Challenge**: Balancing Western dramatic theory with traditional Timorese storytelling techniques.
   **Solution**: Emphasize that the three-act structure is a tool, not a rule. Encourage students to explore how traditional stories might follow different patterns and discuss the strengths of various approaches.

3. **Challenge**: Students may have difficulty creating original scenes based on local legends.
   **Solution**: Offer a brainstorming session where students can share ideas and get feedback. Provide a simple template or story starter to help them begin.

4. **Challenge**: Language barriers in understanding complex dramatic terminology.
   **Solution**: Create a bilingual glossary with terms in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts.

5. **Challenge**: Engaging students who may be more familiar with oral storytelling traditions.
   **Solution**: Incorporate oral storytelling exercises into the lesson. Allow students to present their scenes orally before writing them down, bridging the gap between traditional and written forms.
