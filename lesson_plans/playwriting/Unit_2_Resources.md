## Timorese Folktale: "The Legend of Crocodile Island"

Long ago, when the world was young, there lived a giant crocodile in the seas around Timor. This crocodile was ancient and tired, having swum the oceans for thousands of years. One day, feeling weary, the crocodile dragged itself onto the shore to rest.

As the crocodile lay there, a young boy came across it. Instead of running away in fear, the boy took pity on the exhausted creature. He brought the crocodile fresh water and fish to eat, tending to it day after day.

Grateful for the boy's kindness, the crocodile promised to help the boy however it could. Years passed, and the boy grew into a man. One day, he asked the crocodile to take him on a journey to see distant lands.

The crocodile agreed, and the man climbed onto its back. They swam for many days and nights, exploring the vast oceans. But as they traveled, the crocodile grew older and more tired.

Finally, the crocodile told the man it could swim no more. With its last bit of strength, it transformed itself into an island – the very island that would become Timor. The ridges of its back became the mountains, and its scales the hills and valleys.

The man became the first Timorese, and he populated the island with his descendants. To this day, the Timorese people remember the sacrifice of the crocodile and treat the creature with respect and reverence.

## Historical Account: Xanana Gusmão's Resistance

Xanana Gusmão, born José Alexandre Gusmão, emerged as a pivotal figure in Timor-Leste's struggle for independence. In 1975, when Indonesia invaded East Timor, Gusmão joined FRETILIN (Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor) and took to the mountains to resist the occupation.

For years, Gusmão led guerrilla operations against Indonesian forces, becoming the face of Timorese resistance. He was known for his charisma, strategic thinking, and ability to unite diverse factions within the resistance movement.

In 1992, Gusmão was captured by Indonesian forces and sentenced to life imprisonment. However, even from his cell, he continued to lead the resistance movement, smuggling out messages and coordinating with international supporters.

After his release in 1999, following the fall of the Suharto regime in Indonesia, Gusmão played a crucial role in Timor-Leste's transition to independence. He became the country's first president in 2002 and later served as prime minister.

Gusmão's journey from guerrilla fighter to national leader embodies the resilience and determination of the Timorese people in their long struggle for self-determination.
