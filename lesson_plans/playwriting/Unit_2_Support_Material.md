1. Challenge: Students struggling to move beyond stereotypes
   - Solution: Encourage students to combine traits from different archetypes or add unexpected characteristics to familiar types

2. Challenge: Difficulty in creating culturally authentic yet universal characters
   - Solution: Have students start with a universal human desire, then layer on culturally specific traits and experiences

3. Challenge: Students creating passive characters without clear motivations
   - Solution: Introduce the concept of "character want vs. need" and have students clearly define both for their characters

4. Challenge: Monologues lacking depth or authenticity
   - Solution: Encourage research into historical figures and their time periods. Provide examples of strong monologues for analysis

5. Challenge: Students hesitant to share their work
   - Solution: Start with small group sharing before full class presentations. Establish clear, supportive feedback guidelines

6. Challenge: Balancing traditional and modern elements in character creation
   - Solution: Discuss how traditional values might conflict with or adapt to modern situations, and encourage characters that embody this tension
