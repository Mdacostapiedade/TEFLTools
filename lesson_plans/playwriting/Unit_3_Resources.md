## Traditional Timorese Story: "The Crocodile and the Boy"

Long ago, a boy found a small crocodile stranded in a swamp. Taking pity on the creature, he carried it to the sea. The grateful crocodile offered to take the boy anywhere he wished to go. They became friends and traveled the seas together. When the crocodile grew old, he transformed his body into the island of Timor as a gift to his human friend, creating a home for the boy and his descendants.

## Bilingual Dialogue Example

MARIA: (In Tetum) Maun, hau hakarak koalia ho ita kona ba buat importante ida.
(Brother, I need to talk to you about something important.)

JOÃO: (In Portuguese) O que é, minha irmã? Pareces preocupada.
(What is it, my sister? You seem worried.)

MARIA: (Switching to Portuguese) É sobre o nosso pai. Ele está doente.
(It's about our father. He's sick.)

JOÃO: (In Tetum) Saida mak akontese ba nia? Ita tenke lori nia ba ospitál?
(What happened to him? Should we take him to the hospital?)

MARIA: (In Tetum) Lae, la'ós grave. Maibé nia presiza ita nia tulun.
(No, it's not serious. But he needs our help.)

# Lecture Notes

## 1. Subtext and Subtlety in Dialogue

- Definition: Subtext is the underlying meaning or intention behind spoken dialogue
- Purpose: Creates depth, realism, and complexity in characters and situations
- Techniques:
  1. Contradiction between words and actions
  2. Use of pauses and silences
  3. Repetition with changing emphasis
  4. Indirect responses to questions
- Examples from literature and theatre
- Cultural considerations in Timorese context

## 2. Code-switching and Bilingualism in Timorese Plays

- Definition of code-switching: Alternating between two or more languages in a single conversation
- Prevalence in Timorese society: Tetum, Portuguese, local languages
- Functions in theatre:
  1. Character development
  2. Establishing setting and social context
  3. Creating tension or humor
  4. Reflecting real-life language use
- Challenges in writing and performing bilingual dialogue
- Examples from contemporary Timorese playwrights

# Discussion Questions

## Subtext and Subtlety

1. How does subtext differ in Timorese communication compared to Western examples?
2. In what situations might a character use subtext instead of speaking directly?
3. How can playwrights effectively convey subtext to both actors and audiences?

## Code-switching and Bilingualism

1. What are some common situations in Timor-Leste where code-switching occurs?
2. How might a character's language choice reveal their background or intentions?
3. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of using multiple languages in a play?

# Writing Exercises

## 1. Subtext Scene

Write a short dialogue between two characters where what they're saying is different from what they mean. Consider:
- A family disagreement where politeness masks true feelings
- A political discussion where speakers use euphemisms to avoid direct criticism
- A romantic encounter where neither person wants to admit their true feelings

## 2. Code-switching Practice

Create a scene where characters switch between Tetum and Portuguese. The switch should occur for a specific reason, such as:
- Emphasizing a point
- Excluding someone from the conversation
- Quoting someone else
- Expressing an idea that's easier in one language than the other

## Code-switching Analysis Worksheet

1. Identify each instance of code-switching in the provided scene.
2. For each switch, answer:
   - Which languages are involved?
   - Who initiates the switch?
   - What is the apparent reason for the switch?
   - How does it affect the tone or meaning of the conversation?
3. Overall analysis:
   - What patterns do you notice in the code-switching?
   - How does the bilingual dialogue contribute to character development?
   - In what ways does the language use reflect Timorese society?

## Subtext Examples

1. "I'm fine." (Said with a trembling voice and avoiding eye contact)
   Subtext: The speaker is upset but doesn't want to discuss it.

2. "Your new haircut is... interesting." (Said with a forced smile)
