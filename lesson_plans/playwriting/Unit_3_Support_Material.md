- **Cultural context**: The social, historical, and linguistic background that influences communication

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Code-switching Spectrum Diagram**:
   A horizontal line with "Tetum" on the left end and "Portuguese" on the right. Arrows pointing to different points along the line represent various degrees of code-switching, from occasional word substitution to full language alternation.

2. **Subtext Iceberg**:
   An iceberg image where the visible part above water represents spoken dialogue, and the larger hidden part below water represents subtext and underlying meanings.

3. **Language Register Pyramid**:
   A pyramid divided into five horizontal sections, from bottom to top: Intimate, Casual, Consultative, Formal, and Frozen. This visually represents the different levels of language formality.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Bilingual Dialogue Analysis Worksheet**:
   - Provide a short bilingual scene (Tetum and Portuguese)
   - Questions for analysis:
     * Identify instances of code-switching
     * Explain the purpose of each code-switch (e.g., emphasis, cultural reference)
     * How does language choice reveal character traits or relationships?
     * Rewrite a portion of the dialogue using only one language. How does this change the scene?

2. **Subtext Creation Exercise**:
   - Provide three everyday situations (e.g., buying groceries, meeting a friend, job interview)
   - Students write short dialogues for each situation where characters say one thing but mean another
   - Space for reflection on the challenges and effectiveness of creating subtext

3. **Traditional Story Adaptation Guide**:
   - Outline of a traditional Timorese story
   - Step-by-step guide for adapting the story into modern dialogue:
     1. Identify key plot points
     2. Develop character profiles
     3. Choose appropriate language register for each character
     4. Incorporate bilingual elements
     5. Modernize cultural references while preserving core themes

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Proficiency Variations**:
   - Challenge: Students may have different levels of proficiency in Tetum and Portuguese.
   - Solution: Pair students with complementary language skills for group work. Provide additional language support materials as needed.

2. **Cultural Sensitivity**:
   - Challenge: Adapting traditional stories may raise concerns about cultural appropriation or misrepresentation.
   - Solution: Discuss the importance of respectful adaptation. Invite local cultural experts to provide guidance and context.

3. **Technology Limitations**:
   - Challenge: Limited access to laptops or tablets for writing exercises.
   - Solution: Prepare alternative paper-based activities. Encourage collaborative writing on shared devices if available.

4. **Balancing Creativity and Structure**:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle to balance creative expression with the technical aspects of dialogue writing.
   - Solution: Provide clear rubrics that value both creativity and adherence to dialogue principles. Offer examples of effective creative dialogues.

5. **Engaging Reluctant Speakers**:
   - Challenge: Some students may be hesitant to perform their dialogues in front of the class.
   - Solution: Start with pair performances, then small groups, before moving to full class presentations. Offer the option of having other students perform one's work.
