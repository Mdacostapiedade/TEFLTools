## Traditional Timorese Folktale: "The Crocodile and the Boy"

Long ago, a boy found a small crocodile stranded in a swamp far from the river. Taking pity on the creature, the boy carried it on his back to the river. Grateful for the boy's kindness, the crocodile offered to take him on a journey across the sea. As they traveled, the crocodile grew larger and stronger. When they reached a distant shore, the crocodile said, "My friend, I am forever changed by your kindness. I will become land for your people." The crocodile transformed into the island of Timor, its scales becoming mountains and valleys, providing a home for the boy and his descendants.

## Contemporary Scene: "The Fisherman's Dilemma"

[Setting: A small fishing village on the coast of Timor-Leste. JOÃO, a middle-aged fisherman, stands on the beach, looking out at the sea. His son, PAULO, a teenager, approaches.]

PAULO: Father, the nets are mended. Are we going out today?

JOÃO: (Sighing) I don't know, son. The catch has been poor these past weeks.

PAULO: But we must try. How else will we eat?

JOÃO: It's not just about the catch anymore. The waters are changing. The fish we used to find close to shore are gone.

PAULO: Then we'll go further out!

JOÃO: With what fuel? We can barely afford to run the boat as it is.

PAULO: (Frustrated) So we just give up? Let our family starve?

JOÃO: No, Paulo. We adapt. Maybe it's time we looked to the land, not just the sea.

PAULO: But we're fishermen. It's who we are.

JOÃO: We're Timorese. We've faced worse and survived. We'll find a way.

[They stand together, looking out at the sea as the sun begins to set.]
