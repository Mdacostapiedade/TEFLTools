## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to balance social commentary with dramatic storytelling.
   **Tip**: Encourage students to focus on personal stories that reflect larger issues. Provide examples of successful plays that address social issues without being didactic.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to Timorese play texts for examples.
   **Tip**: Collaborate with local theatre groups or cultural centers to source scripts. If unavailable, use news articles or personal accounts as starting points for dramatic scenarios.

3. **Challenge**: Students may be hesitant to address sensitive social issues.
   **Tip**: Create a safe, respectful classroom environment. Discuss the importance of artistic expression in social change. Offer the option to write anonymously if needed.

4. **Challenge**: Varying levels of writing experience among students.
   **Tip**: Provide clear structure and guidelines for writing tasks. Implement peer review sessions to allow students to learn from each other. Offer additional support during individual writing time.

5. **Challenge**: Difficulty in visualizing how social issues translate to stage performance.
   **Tip**: If possible, arrange for a local theatre group to perform a short scene addressing a social issue. Alternatively, use video clips of socially engaged theatre from other countries.
