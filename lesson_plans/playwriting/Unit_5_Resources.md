## Timorese Myths for Adaptation

### The Legend of Crocodile Island

Long ago, a young boy found a small crocodile trapped in a swamp. Taking pity on the creature, he carried it to the sea. The grateful crocodile offered to take the boy on journeys across the ocean. As years passed, the crocodile grew enormous. On their final journey, the crocodile told the boy it was time to die, but its body would become an island for the boy's descendants. The crocodile transformed into the island of Timor, its scales becoming mountains and valleys.

### The Tale of Liurai-Lulik

In ancient times, a sacred king named Liurai-Lulik ruled over the land. He possessed magical powers and could communicate with the spirits of nature. One day, invaders threatened the kingdom. Liurai-Lulik used his powers to summon the winds and rains, creating a great storm that drove away the enemies. However, the use of such powerful magic drained his life force. As he lay dying, he promised his people that his spirit would always protect the land, living on in the sacred mountains and forests.

### The Origin of Tais Weaving

A young woman named Bui-Bela lived in a village at the foot of Mount Ramelau. One night, she dreamed of intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The next morning, she began weaving, creating the first tais cloth. The spirits of her ancestors guided her hands, infusing the fabric with protective magic. When a great drought threatened the village, Bui-Bela's tais brought rain, saving her people. From that day on, the art of tais weaving became a sacred tradition, passed down through generations.
