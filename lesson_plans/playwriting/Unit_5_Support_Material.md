## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barriers:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle with writing in Tetum or Portuguese.
   - Solution: Encourage initial drafts in the language students are most comfortable with, then work on translation or language integration later.

2. Limited Knowledge of Traditional Stories:
   - Challenge: Students may not be familiar with a wide range of Timorese myths and folktales.
   - Solution: Provide a diverse selection of stories and encourage students to interview family members or community elders to learn more.

3. Balancing Tradition and Innovation:
   - Challenge: Students may find it difficult to modernize stories while respecting traditional elements.
   - Solution: Discuss examples of successful adaptations that maintain cultural integrity while appealing to contemporary audiences.

4. Incorporating Music and Dance:
   - Challenge: Students with limited performing arts experience may struggle to integrate these elements.
   - Solution: Provide simple techniques for incorporating music and movement, such as using them for scene transitions or as background elements.

5. Cultural Sensitivity:
   - Challenge: Adapting sacred or culturally significant stories may raise concerns about appropriateness.
   - Solution: Discuss the importance of respect and cultural consultation. Encourage students to seek guidance from cultural experts when adapting sensitive material.

6. Technical Limitations:
   - Challenge: Limited access to technology for audio/video resources.
   - Solution: Prepare alternative activities using printed materials or live demonstrations. Encourage students to use their imagination and descriptive writing.
