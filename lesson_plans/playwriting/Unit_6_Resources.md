## Collaborative Writing Example: "The Unexpected Guest"

Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the mountains of Timor-Leste, a family was preparing for their annual harvest celebration. The eldest daughter, Maria, was busy cooking traditional dishes in the kitchen. Her brother, Jo√£o, was decorating the courtyard with colorful flags and flowers.

"Good evening," he said in a soft voice. "I am a traveler from a distant land. Might I trouble you for a place to rest for the night?"

With a warm smile, the mother stepped forward. "Come in, traveler. You are welcome to join our celebration and share our meal." As the stranger entered, the family felt a mixture of excitement and apprehension. Little did they know that this unexpected guest would change their lives forever...
