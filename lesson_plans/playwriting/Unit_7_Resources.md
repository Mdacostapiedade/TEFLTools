# Resources for Learning Unit 7: Staging and Production Considerations

## Lecture Notes

### Writing for Limited Resources

#### Introduction
- Timorese theatre often faces resource constraints
- Limited budgets, equipment, and venue options
- Creativity and resourcefulness are key

#### Common Limitations
- Small or makeshift performance spaces
- Minimal lighting and sound equipment
- Limited props and set pieces
- Few trained technicians

#### Strategies for Impactful Scenes
1. Focus on strong performances and dialogue
2. Use versatile, multi-purpose set pieces
3. Incorporate found objects and natural materials
4. Employ simple but effective lighting techniques (e.g., handheld lights, candles)
5. Utilize live music or a cappella singing instead of recorded tracks

#### Examples of Successful Low-Budget Productions
- "The Chairs" by Eugène Ionesco - minimalist staging with just two actors and chairs
- "Our Town" by Thornton Wilder - minimal set, pantomime, and narration
- "Waiting for Godot" by Samuel Beckett - sparse set with a single tree

### Adapting to Non-Traditional Spaces

#### Site-Specific Theatre Overview
- Definition: Theatre created for a unique, often non-traditional space
- Advantages: Immersive experience, community engagement, lower venue costs
- Challenges: Acoustics, weather, audience comfort, legal considerations

#### Techniques for Utilizing Environmental Features
1. Incorporate natural or architectural elements into the narrative
2. Use levels and different areas to create distinct "scenes"
3. Consider the audience's perspective and movement through the space
4. Adapt blocking to suit the environment's unique features
5. Utilize natural acoustics or create "sound zones"

#### Audience Considerations
- Seating arrangements (if any)
- Sight lines and visibility
- Movement between scenes or locations
- Safety and accessibility
- Protection from weather elements

### Incorporating Local Performance Traditions

#### Traditional Timorese Performance Elements
- Ritual dances (e.g., tebe-tebe, bidu)
- Storytelling techniques (e.g., ai-knanoik)
- Musical instruments (e.g., kakalo'an, babadok)
- Mask and puppet traditions

#### Blending Traditional and Modern Techniques
1. Integrate traditional music or instruments into the score
2. Incorporate ritual movements or dances into blocking
3. Use traditional storytelling structures in modern narratives
4. Adapt traditional masks or puppetry for contemporary characters
5. Employ bilingual dialogue (Tetum and Portuguese) to reflect linguistic heritage

#### Examples of Successful Fusion
- "The Ramayana" adapted by Singaporean theatre company TheatreWorks - blending traditional Southeast Asian performance styles with contemporary staging
- "The Mahabharata" directed by Peter Brook - incorporating various Asian theatre traditions into a Western theatrical framework

## Discussion Questions

1. How can limited resources in Timorese theatre be viewed as an opportunity rather than a constraint?
2. What are some potential non-traditional spaces in Timor-Leste that could be used for theatrical performances? What unique challenges and opportunities would each present?
3. How might incorporating traditional Timorese performance elements enhance or complicate a modern theatrical production?
4. In what ways can site-specific theatre engage with and benefit local communities in Timor-Leste?
5. How can playwrights and directors balance the preservation of traditional performance elements with the need for innovation in Timorese theatre?
6. What role can theatre play in addressing social issues in Timor-Leste, and how might staging considerations impact this potential?
7. How might the multilingual nature of Timorese society influence staging and production decisions?
8. What are some potential funding sources or resource-sharing strategies that could help overcome limitations in Timorese theatre production?

## Writing Exercises

### Exercise 1: Adapting a Scene for a Non-Traditional Space

Instructions:
1. Choose a short scene from a play you're familiar with or use the provided sample scene.
2. Select a non-traditional location in Timor-Leste (e.g., a beach, marketplace, sacred grove, abandoned building).
3. Rewrite the scene, adapting it to the chosen location. Consider:
   - How the environment affects the characters' actions and dialogue
   - What natural or found objects could be incorporated as props or set pieces
   - How the audience might be positioned or move within the space
   - Any local performance traditions that could be integrated
4. Write a brief paragraph explaining your choices and how they enhance the scene.

### Exercise 2: Creating a Resource-Limited Production Concept

Instructions:
1. Choose a well-known play or story (e.g., Romeo and Juliet, a Timorese folktale).
2. Imagine you're producing this play with very limited resources in a small Timorese village.
3. Write a one-page production concept addressing:
   - Set design using only found objects and natural materials
   - Costume ideas using everyday clothing or simple fabrication techniques
   - Lighting solutions without electrical equipment
   - Sound and music using only live performers or simple instruments
   - How you would stage the play to maximize impact with minimal resources
4. Conclude with a brief statement on how these limitations might actually enhance the storytelling or audience experience.

### Sample Scene for Adaptation Exercise

Title: "The Promise"

Setting: A park bench

Characters:
- MARIA, a young woman in her 20s
- JOÃO, a young man in his 20s

(MARIA is sitting on the bench, looking anxious. JOÃO enters.)

JOÃO: Maria! I'm sorry I'm late. The traffic was terrible.

MARIA: (coldly) You're always late, João. Always with an excuse.

JOÃO: I know, I know. But this time it's different. I have something important to tell you.

MARIA: (standing) Save it. I'm tired of waiting. I'm tired of your promises.

JOÃO: Please, just give me one more chance. I've changed.

MARIA: Changed? How?

JOÃO: I... I got a job. A real job, with a future. We can start planning our life together.

MARIA: (hesitating) A job? Where?

JOÃO: At the new factory in Dili. It's not glamorous, but it's steady work.

MARIA: (softening slightly) João, that's... that's good news. But why didn't you tell me sooner?

JOÃO: I wanted to surprise you. To show you I can be responsible.

MARIA: (sitting back down) Oh, João. I want to believe you.

JOÃO: (sitting beside her) Then believe me. I promise, from now on, things will be different.

MARIA: (taking his hand) Okay. One more chance. But this is the last one.

JOÃO: It's all I need. I won't let you down this time.

(They embrace as the scene ends.)

### Example of a Timorese Folktale for Adaptation

Title: "The Crocodile and the Boy"

Long ago, on the island of Timor, there lived a young boy who loved to swim in the sea. One day, while swimming far from shore, he became very tired and feared he would drown. Suddenly, a large crocodile appeared beside him.

The boy was afraid, but the crocodile spoke gently, "Do not fear, young one. Climb onto my back, and I will carry you to safety." Grateful and relieved, the boy did as the crocodile said.

As they swam towards the shore, the boy and the crocodile began to talk. They shared stories of their lives and soon became friends. When they reached the beach, the boy thanked the crocodile and invited him to visit again.

Over the years, the boy grew into a man, and the crocodile continued to visit him. Their friendship deepened, and the crocodile shared his wisdom about the sea and its creatures.

One day, when the man had grown old, the crocodile came to him and said, "My friend, I am dying. But before I go, I want to give you a gift. My body will become the land on which your people will live and prosper."

The old man wept for his friend but accepted the gift with gratitude. As the crocodile died, his body grew and transformed, becoming the island of Timor. And so, the Timorese people say that their island is shaped like a crocodile, a reminder of the friendship between a boy and a creature of the sea.
