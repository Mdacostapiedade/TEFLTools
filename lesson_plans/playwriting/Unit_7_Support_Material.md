## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Stage Configurations Diagram**: A simple illustration showing different stage layouts (proscenium, thrust, in-the-round, traverse) and their typical sight lines.

2. **Found Space Examples**: A collage of images showing various non-traditional performance spaces (e.g., beach, marketplace, ruins, forest clearing) with annotations on how they could be used for staging.

3. **Resource-Limited Staging Ideas**: A visual guide showing creative uses of everyday objects as props or set pieces (e.g., crates as furniture, fabric as backdrops, lanterns for lighting).

4. **Traditional Timorese Performance Elements**: A chart illustrating key elements of traditional Timorese performances (e.g., dance movements, musical instruments, costume pieces) and how they might be incorporated into modern productions.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Scene Adaptation Worksheet**:
   - Original scene excerpt
   - Assigned non-traditional location
   - Questions to consider:
     * How can you use the natural features of the space?
     * Where will the audience be positioned?
     * What local performance traditions could you incorporate?
   - Space for notes and sketches

2. **Community Theatre Production Plan Template**:
   - Project title and brief description
   - Potential venues (pros and cons for each)
   - List of required resources (human, material, financial)
   - Community engagement strategies
   - Potential challenges and proposed solutions
   - Timeline for pre-production, rehearsals, and performance

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Site-Specific Performance" by Mike Pearson
2. "Environmental Theater" by Richard Schechner
3. "Theatre in Non-Traditional Spaces" - Online course by Coursera
4. "The Empty Space" by Peter Brook

6. Local resources: Contact information for Timorese cultural centers, traditional performers, and community leaders willing to collaborate on theatrical projects

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Limited resources**: Encourage creative problem-solving and resourcefulness. Demonstrate how everyday objects can be repurposed for theatrical use.

2. **Language barriers**: Prepare key terms in both Tetum and English. Use visual aids and demonstrations to clarify concepts.

3. **Cultural sensitivity**: Research and respect local customs and taboos. Invite community elders or cultural experts to provide guidance on appropriate use of traditional elements.

4. **Varied skill levels**: Implement peer mentoring and group work to support less experienced students. Provide additional challenges for advanced learners.

5. **Resistance to non-traditional spaces**: Start with familiar locations and gradually introduce more unconventional ideas. Share successful examples from other cultures.

6. **Community engagement**: Build relationships with local organizations and leaders. Emphasize the benefits of theatre for community building and cultural preservation.

7. **Technical limitations**: Focus on storytelling and performance rather than complex technical elements. Teach simple, effective techniques for lighting and sound using available resources.

8. **Balancing tradition and innovation**: Encourage respectful experimentation. Discuss how traditional elements can be honored while exploring new forms of expression.

9. **Time management**: Provide clear timelines for activities. Use timed exercises to help students work efficiently and make quick creative decisions.

10. **Performance anxiety**: Create a supportive classroom environment. Introduce relaxation and focus techniques that students can use when presenting their work.
