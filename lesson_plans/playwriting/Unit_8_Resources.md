## Sample One-Act Play: "The Tais Weaver's Tale"

```
THE TAIS WEAVER'S TALE
By [Your Name]

Characters:
MARIA - A skilled tais weaver, 60s
JOÃO - Maria's grandson, 20s
ELDER - Village elder, 70s
TOURIST - Australian visitor, 40s

Setting: A small village in the mountains of Timor-Leste. Present day.

(Lights up on MARIA, weaving a tais on her loom. JOÃO enters, carrying a backpack.)

JOÃO: Avó! I'm home from Dili!

MARIA: (Without looking up) João? Is that you? Come, come. Let me see how the city has changed you.

JOÃO: (Laughing) It's only been a month, Avó. I haven't changed that much.

MARIA: Hmph. We'll see about that. (She stops weaving and looks at him) You look thin. Didn't they feed you in that fancy university?

JOÃO: (Smiling) The food was fine, Avó. But nothing compares to your cooking.

MARIA: Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. Now, tell me about your studies. Did you learn anything useful?

JOÃO: (Excitedly) Oh, Avó, I learned so much! About business, and tourism, and how to market our crafts to the world.

MARIA: (Frowning) Market our crafts? What does that mean?

JOÃO: It means we can sell our tais to people all over the world. We can make more money, improve our lives.

MARIA: (Shaking her head) Our tais are not for selling to the world, João. They tell our stories, our history. They are sacred.

JOÃO: But Avó, think of the opportunities! We could build a better house, get you proper medical care-

MARIA: (Interrupting) And lose our soul in the process? No, João. Some things are not for sale.

(The ELDER enters, followed by a TOURIST)

ELDER: Maria, look who I've brought! This is Mr. Smith from Australia. He's interested in our tais.

TOURIST: (Enthusiastically) Oh yes, they're absolutely fascinating! Such intricate designs. I'd love to buy one as a souvenir.

JOÃO: (Eagerly) Of course! We'd be happy to-

MARIA: (Firmly) I'm sorry, but these tais are not for sale. They are part of our heritage, our identity.

TOURIST: (Disappointed) Oh, I see. But surely you could make one to sell? I'd pay very well.

JOÃO: (To Maria) Avó, please. This could be a great opportunity for us.

MARIA: (Standing) No, João. Some things are more valuable than money. (To the Tourist) I'm sorry, but our tais are not souvenirs. They are our stories, our connection to our ancestors. They are not for sale.

TOURIST: (Nodding slowly) I think I understand. Thank you for explaining.

ELDER: (Smiling) Perhaps, Mr. Smith, you'd like to hear the stories behind our tais instead? That is something we'd be happy to share.

JOÃO: (Looking thoughtful) Yes, the stories... Maybe that's what we should be sharing with the world, not just the tais themselves.

MARIA: (Softening) Now that, my grandson, is an idea worth weaving.

(Lights fade as MARIA returns to her loom, with JOÃO, the ELDER, and the TOURIST gathered around to listen to her story.)

# Lecture Notes

## Revision and Editing Techniques

1. The Importance of Revision
   - First drafts are rarely perfect
   - Revision allows for refinement and improvement
   - Opportunity to align work more closely with original vision

2. Common Revision Strategies
   a. Read Aloud
      - Helps identify awkward phrasing
      - Reveals issues with rhythm and flow
      - Useful for catching dialogue that doesn't sound natural

   b. Focus on Character Objectives and Conflicts
      - Ensure each character has clear goals
      - Check that conflicts drive the plot forward
      - Verify that character actions align with their motivations

   c. Trim Unnecessary Elements
      - Cut redundant dialogue
      - Remove excessive stage directions
      - Eliminate scenes that don't advance the plot or reveal character

   d. Ensure Cultural Authenticity
      - Verify accuracy of cultural references
      - Check that dialogue reflects realistic language use in Timor-Leste
      - Confirm that themes and issues are relevant to Timorese context

3. Practical Revision Techniques
   - Use different colored pens for different types of revisions
   - Create a revision checklist tailored to your common issues
   - Set specific goals for each revision pass (e.g., focus on dialogue in one pass, structure in another)

## Preparing Scripts for Production

1. Standard Script Formatting
   - Use 12-point Courier font
   - Number pages
   - Include character list and setting description at the beginning
   - Use all caps for character names in dialogue and stage directions
   - Center act and scene headings

2. Effective Use of Stage Directions
   - Keep directions brief and essential
   - Focus on actions that are necessary for understanding the story
   - Avoid directing actors' emotions (e.g., "angrily") - let this come through in dialogue

3. Character Descriptions and Setting Details
   - Provide clear, concise character descriptions
   - Include age, relevant physical characteristics, and key personality traits
   - Describe the setting in enough detail to set the scene, but leave room for directorial interpretation

4. Additional Considerations for Timorese Productions
   - Note any specific cultural elements that may need explanation or special attention
   - If using multiple languages, provide translations or language notes
   - Consider including a glossary for Timorese terms or concepts

## Staged Readings

1. Purpose of Staged Readings
   - To hear the play out loud with multiple voices
   - To gauge audience reaction and gather feedback
   - To identify areas for improvement in the script

2. Process of Conducting a Staged Reading
   - Cast readers (can be other playwrights or actors)
   - Provide scripts in advance if possible
   - Minimal or no blocking - focus is on the words
   - Include a narrator to read stage directions if necessary

3. Preparing for a Staged Reading
   - Select a representative excerpt (usually 10-15 minutes)
   - Prepare any necessary context for the audience
   - Practice reading your stage directions aloud
   - Prepare questions for the audience to guide feedback

4. After the Reading
   - Take notes on audience reactions during the reading
   - Conduct a Q&A session
   - Be open to constructive criticism
   - Use feedback to inform your revision process

# Discussion Questions

1. How can we balance the preservation of traditional Timorese storytelling techniques with the demands of modern theatre?

2. What unique challenges might Timorese playwrights face when writing for both local and international audiences?

3. How can revision techniques be adapted to address specific cultural considerations in Timorese plays?

4. In what ways can staged readings benefit the development of new plays in Timor-Leste's emerging theatre scene?

5. How might the use of multiple languages (Tetum, Portuguese, local dialects) in a play affect its production and reception?

6. What role can theatre play in addressing social and political issues in Timor-Leste?

7. How can playwrights effectively incorporate traditional Timorese performance elements (music, dance) into modern plays?

8. What ethical considerations should playwrights keep in mind when adapting traditional Timorese stories for the stage?

# Writing Exercises

## Exercise 1: Dialogue Revision

1. Take a scene from your one-act play with at least two characters.
2. Rewrite the scene three times:
   a. Using only single-word dialogue exchanges
   b. Using no more than three words per line of dialogue
   c. Using at least one Tetum phrase or word in each line of dialogue
3. Reflect on how these constraints affected the scene's rhythm and character voices.

## Exercise 2: Cultural Context Enhancement

1. Choose a scene from your play that could benefit from more Timorese cultural context.
2. Research a specific Timorese cultural practice, belief, or tradition relevant to your scene.
3. Revise the scene to incorporate this cultural element, either through dialogue, action, or setting description.
4. Share your revised scene with a partner and discuss how the added cultural context impacts the scene.

## Exercise 3: Stage Direction Refinement

1. Select a page from your script with several stage directions.
2. Rewrite the stage directions following these guidelines:
   a. Eliminate any direction that describes a character's emotions
   b. Reduce each direction to no more than two short sentences
   c. Focus only on actions that are essential to understanding the story
3. Read both versions aloud and compare their effectiveness.
