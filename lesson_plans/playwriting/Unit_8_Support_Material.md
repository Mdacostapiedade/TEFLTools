## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with cultural authenticity.
   **Solution**: Encourage research and interviews with community members. Organize field trips to cultural events or invite guest speakers from the local theatre community.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in writing dialogue in Tetum or Portuguese.
   **Solution**: Provide language support resources and allow students to write initial drafts in their most comfortable language before translating or adapting.

3. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by the scope of writing a full one-act play.
   **Solution**: Break the process into smaller, manageable tasks. Set interim deadlines for outlines, character profiles, and individual scenes.

4. **Challenge**: Lack of confidence in sharing work during peer reviews.
   **Solution**: Establish clear guidelines for constructive feedback. Start with anonymous reviews or small group discussions before moving to full class sharing.

5. **Challenge**: Limited access to local theatre productions for reference.
   **Solution**: Create a video library of recorded performances, including international plays with Tetum subtitles. Organize class trips to any available local productions.

6. **Challenge**: Difficulty in imagining staging with limited resources.
   **Solution**: Conduct exercises in minimalist staging techniques. Encourage creative use of everyday objects as props and set pieces.
