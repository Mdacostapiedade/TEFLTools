## Timorese Poems for Group Discussion

### "Timor" by Xanana Gusmão

```
My land, my people
Centuries of pain etched in your face
Yet your spirit remains unbroken
Like the sandalwood that scents our hills

From Ataúro to Jaco
Your children stand tall
Their hearts beating with the rhythm
Of our ancestors' dreams

Timor, my beloved
Your freedom hard-won
Now we build, we grow, we learn
Our future bright as the rising sun
```

### "Dadolin" (Traditional Timorese Poetic Form)

```
Ai-funan moris iha rai-henek
Nia moris mesak la iha maluk

(A flower grows in the sand
It grows alone without companions)

Ita nia lian hanesan ksolok nia lian
Ita nia oin hanesan fitun nia naroman

(Your voice is like the sound of joy
Your face is like the light of the stars)
```

### "Rai Doben" by Abé Barreto

```
Rai doben, rai lulik
O mak ami nia inan no aman
O mak ami nia moris no mate
O mak ami nia klamar no isin

(Beloved land, sacred land
You are our mother and father
You are our life and death
You are our soul and body)
```
