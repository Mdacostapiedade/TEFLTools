## Sample Poems for Reading Aloud

### "The Classroom" by Xanana Gusm√£o

```
In this room, we gather
Minds open, hearts ready
To explore the world of words
And discover the poet within

Our voices rise and fall
Like the hills of our homeland
Each line a step towards
Understanding ourselves and others

Here, we are all poets
Our experiences valid
Our expressions unique
In this safe space, we grow
```

### "Feedback" by Anonymous

```
Your words are a mirror
Reflecting what I've created
Not to break, but to polish
Helping me see clearer

Speak with kindness, speak with care
For in your voice, I hear
The echo of my own doubts
And the whisper of my potential
```
