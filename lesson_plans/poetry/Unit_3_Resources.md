## Overview of Format Poems

### Definition and Purpose
- Format poems are structured poetic forms with specific rules and patterns
- They provide a framework for creativity and help poets focus on specific elements
- Format poems can be excellent tools for teaching poetry, especially to beginners

### Common Types of Format Poems
1. Haiku
2. Acrostic
3. Cinquain
4. Limerick
5. Sonnet
6. Tanka

### Benefits of Teaching Format Poems
- Builds understanding of poetic structure and form
- Encourages creativity within constraints
- Helps develop language skills and vocabulary
- Accessible entry point for novice poets

## Haiku

### Structure
- Three lines
- Traditionally 5-7-5 syllable pattern
- Modern haiku may deviate from strict syllable count

### Characteristics
- Focus on nature and seasons
- Captures a moment in time
- Often includes a "cutting word" or shift in perspective

### Example in English
```
An old silent pond...
A frog jumps into the pond,
splash! Silence again.
```
- By Matsuo Bash≈ç (translated)

### Example in Tetum
```
Ai-funan mean
Nakfera iha dadeer
Loro-matan sae
```
(Red flower / Blooms in the morning / Sun rises)

## Acrostic

### Structure
- Vertical word or phrase spelled out by first letter of each line
- Line length can vary

### Characteristics
- Can be about any topic
- Often used to describe the subject of the acrostic
- Encourages creative word choice and vocabulary building

### Example in English
```
Peaceful
Ocean
Endless
Majestic
```

### Example in Tetum
```
Tasi
Ita-nia
Moris
Ohin
Rai
```
(Sea / Our / Life / Today / Land)

## Cinquain

### Structure
- Five lines
- Typically follows a syllable or word count pattern:
  Line 1: 2 syllables or 1 word (noun)
  Line 2: 4 syllables or 2 words (adjectives)
  Line 3: 6 syllables or 3 words (verbs)
  Line 4: 8 syllables or 4 words (phrase)
  Line 5: 2 syllables or 1 word (synonym for Line 1)

### Characteristics
- Concise and descriptive
- Builds from a single concept to a broader idea
- Encourages careful word selection

### Example in English
```
Mountain
Tall, majestic
Rising, towering, reaching
Touching the cloudy sky above
Summit
```

### Example in Tetum
```
Foho
Aas, furak
Hamriik, haree, proteje
Rai-Timor nia oan sira
Lalehan
```
(Mountain / Tall, beautiful / Stand, watch, protect / Timor's children / Sky)

## Adapting Format Poems to Timorese Themes and Language

### Cultural Considerations
- Incorporate local flora, fauna, and landscapes
- Reference Timorese traditions and customs
- Use Timorese names and places

### Language Adaptation
- Consider syllable structure in Tetum for haiku and cinquain
- Use Tetum idioms and expressions in acrostics
- Explore traditional Timorese poetic forms (e.g., dadolin) alongside international formats

### Thematic Ideas
- Nature: beaches, mountains, forests
- History: resistance, independence, cultural heritage
- Daily life: markets, farming, fishing
- Spirituality: animist beliefs, Catholic traditions

# Writing Exercises

## Exercise 1: Haiku Nature Walk

1. Take students on a short walk around the school grounds or nearby natural area.
2. Ask them to observe their surroundings carefully, using all their senses.
3. Have students jot down words or phrases describing what they see, hear, smell, or feel.
4. Using their notes, students should write 2-3 haiku poems in Tetum about their observations.
5. Encourage them to focus on capturing a specific moment or image in each haiku.

## Exercise 2: Acrostic Identity Poem

1. Students choose a word related to their identity or Timorese culture (e.g., TIMOR, TETUM, LISAN).
2. They write the word vertically on their paper.
3. For each letter, students write a line that begins with that letter and relates to the chosen word.
4. The lines should describe aspects of their identity or cultural elements associated with the word.
5. After completing the acrostic, students share their poems in small groups, explaining their choices.

## Exercise 3: Cinquain Chain

1. Divide the class into groups of 4-5 students.
2. Provide each group with a theme related to Timorese life or nature.
3. The first student writes the first line of a cinquain (2 syllables or 1 word).
4. The paper is passed to the next student, who adds the second line (4 syllables or 2 words).
5. This continues until the cinquain is complete.
6. Groups then read their collaborative cinquains aloud and discuss the process.

## Exercise 4: Format Poem Translation

1. Provide students with simple examples of haiku, acrostic, and cinquain poems in English.
2. Ask students to translate these poems into Tetum, maintaining the format as closely as possible.
3. Discuss the challenges of translation and how the poems might need to be adapted for Tetum.
4. Have students share their translations and explain their choices.

## Exercise 5: Local Landscape Cinquain

1. Show students photographs of various Timorese landscapes (beaches, mountains, rice fields, etc.).
2. Ask them to choose one image that resonates with them.
3. Guide students through writing a cinquain about their chosen landscape:
   - Line 1: Name the landscape (1 word)
   - Line 2: Describe it (2 words)
   - Line 3: Actions associated with it (3 words)
   - Line 4: A feeling or thought about it (4 words)
   - Line 5: Another word for the landscape (1 word)
4. Students illustrate their cinquains and display them in the classroom.
