## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with syllable counting
   - Tip: Use clapping or tapping to help students hear syllables. Practice with familiar Tetum words before moving to poem creation.

2. Challenge: Limited vocabulary in Tetum for poetry writing
   - Tip: Create a word bank on the board with theme-related vocabulary. Encourage students to share words they know and teach new ones as needed.

3. Challenge: Students feeling intimidated by the structure of format poems
   - Tip: Start with group compositions before individual work. Use fill-in-the-blank templates to build confidence.

4. Challenge: Maintaining focus on structure while encouraging creativity
   - Tip: Emphasize that the structure is a tool, not a limitation. Encourage students to play with words within the format constraints.

5. Challenge: Balancing time between explanation and practice
   - Tip: Use a timer for each activity. Prepare additional exercises for fast finishers to keep all students engaged.

6. Challenge: Students reluctant to share their poems
   - Tip: Start with pair sharing before whole-class sharing. Offer the option to read anonymously or have the teacher read aloud.

7. Challenge: Adapting format poems to Tetum language patterns
   - Tip: Discuss how the structures might need to be adjusted for Tetum. Encourage flexibility while maintaining the essence of each format.
