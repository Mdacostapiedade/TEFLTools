# Lesson Plan: Tailoring Poetry Instruction to Student Needs

## Resources Needed
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with sample poems at different difficulty levels
- Colored index cards
- Art supplies (colored pencils, markers, etc.)
- Computer and projector (if available)

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify different learning styles and their own preferred style
2. Recognize various skill levels in poetry writing
3. Adapt a simple poem for different abilities
4. Create a poetry activity that incorporates multiple learning styles

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
1. Divide the class into small groups
2. Give each group a different colored index card with a simple object written on it (e.g., tree, sun, flower)
3. Ask each group to represent the object in three different ways:
   - Draw it
   - Act it out
   - Describe it verbally
4. Discuss how different people might prefer different methods of expression

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)
Write the following terms on the board and briefly explain each:
- Learning style
- Differentiation
- Scaffolding
- Visual learner
- Auditory learner
- Kinesthetic learner

## Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)
1. Introduce the concept of learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
2. Explain the importance of tailoring instruction to different abilities and learning preferences
3. Present strategies for differentiating poetry instruction:
   - Varying complexity of vocabulary and structure
   - Providing visual aids or manipulatives
   - Incorporating movement and performance
   - Offering choice in poetry topics or formats
4. Show examples of how a simple poem can be adapted for different skill levels

## Practice Activities (25 minutes)
1. Learning Style Inventory (10 minutes):
   - Students complete a brief learning style questionnaire
   - Discuss results and implications for poetry learning

2. Poem Adaptation Exercise (15 minutes):
   - In pairs, students receive a simple haiku
   - They create three versions of the poem:
     a) Simplified for beginners
     b) Standard version
     c) Extended/challenging version for advanced learners

## Production Task (25 minutes)
Multi-Style Poetry Station:
1. Divide the class into small groups
2. Each group creates a poetry activity station that incorporates:
   - A visual element
   - An auditory element
   - A kinesthetic/tactile element
3. Groups rotate to experience each station

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
1. Each group briefly presents their poetry station
2. Class discussion:
   - How did different activities appeal to different learners?
   - What challenges might arise when differentiating instruction?
   - How can teachers ensure all students are appropriately challenged?

## Homework Assignment
1. Create a set of three scaffolded poetry prompts for a format poem of your choice (e.g., acrostic, cinquain)
2. Write a brief reflection on your own learning style and how it might influence your poetry teaching
