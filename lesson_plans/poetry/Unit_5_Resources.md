Green hills embrace us,
Thatched roofs under mango trees,
Children's laughter rings.

# Lecture Notes

## Principles of Constructive Criticism in Creative Writing

1. Be specific and descriptive
   - Point to particular lines, words, or elements in the poem
   - Explain why certain aspects work well or could be improved

2. Focus on the poem, not the poet
   - Avoid personal comments about the writer
   - Discuss the work itself, not assumptions about the author's intent

3. Balance positive observations with suggestions for improvement
   - Start with what works well in the poem
   - Offer constructive suggestions for enhancing weaker areas

4. Offer concrete examples and alternatives
   - Provide specific ideas for revision
   - Suggest alternative word choices or phrasing when appropriate

5. Consider the poem's goals and context
   - Evaluate the poem based on its intended purpose
   - Take into account the poet's skill level and experience

6. Use "I" statements to frame feedback
   - Example: "I found this line particularly powerful because..."
   - Emphasize that feedback is subjective and personal

7. Ask questions to promote reflection
   - Encourage the poet to think deeper about their choices
   - Example: "What made you choose this particular metaphor?"

## Creating Rubrics for Poetry Assessment

1. Purpose of rubrics in poetry assessment
   - Provide clear expectations for students
   - Ensure consistent and fair evaluation
   - Guide feedback and improvement

2. Components of an effective poetry rubric
   - Criteria: Specific aspects of the poem to be evaluated
   - Performance levels: Descriptions of quality for each criterion
   - Descriptors: Clear explanations of what constitutes each level

3. Common criteria for poetry assessment
   - Content and ideas
   - Structure and form
   - Language use and word choice
   - Imagery and figurative language
   - Voice and originality

4. Adapting rubrics for different poetry forms
   - Consider specific requirements of format poems
   - Include criteria relevant to the particular style (e.g., syllable count for haiku)

5. Using rubrics effectively
   - Introduce rubrics before the writing process begins
   - Encourage student self-assessment using the rubric
   - Use rubrics as a tool for peer feedback

6. Balancing structure and creativity
   - Ensure rubrics don't stifle creative expression
   - Include criteria that value originality and personal voice

# Discussion Questions

1. How can we ensure that our feedback on student poetry is both honest and encouraging?
2. What are some potential challenges in assessing poetry objectively, and how can we address them?
3. How might cultural context influence the way we provide feedback on poetry in Timor-Leste?
4. In what ways can rubrics enhance or potentially limit creativity in poetry writing?
5. How can we adapt our feedback strategies for students of different skill levels or confidence in poetry writing?
6. What role should peer feedback play in poetry assessment, and how can we facilitate effective peer critiques?
7. How might we incorporate traditional Timorese poetic forms and values into our assessment criteria?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Exercise 1: Practicing Constructive Feedback

1. Read the provided sample student poem carefully.
2. Write a paragraph of feedback following these steps:
   a. Start with a positive observation about the poem.
   b. Identify a specific area that could be improved.
   c. Offer a concrete suggestion for enhancement.
   d. Close with an encouraging comment about the poem's potential.
3. Share your feedback with a partner and discuss your approaches.

## Exercise 2: Creating a Mini-Rubric

1. Choose one type of format poem (e.g., haiku, acrostic, cinquain).
2. Develop a simple rubric with three criteria specific to that poem type.
3. For each criterion, write brief descriptors for three levels of performance (e.g., excellent, satisfactory, needs improvement).
4. Test your rubric by applying it to one of the sample poems provided.

# Assignment Details

## Poetry Portfolio Assessment Plan

Develop a comprehensive plan for assessing student poetry portfolios. Your plan should include:

1. Portfolio Requirements:
   - Number and types of poems to be included
   - Any required revisions or reflections

2. Assessment Rubric:
   - Create a detailed rubric with at least 5 criteria
   - Include descriptors for each performance level

3. Feedback Strategy:
   - Outline how you will provide written feedback on individual poems
   - Describe any opportunities for verbal feedback or conferences

4. Self-Assessment Component:
   - Design a self-assessment form for students to evaluate their own work

5. Peer Review Process:
   - Explain how you will incorporate peer feedback into the assessment

6. Timeline:
   - Provide a suggested timeline for portfolio development and assessment

7. Reflection:
   - Write a brief reflection (200-300 words) on how this assessment plan aligns with the principles of constructive feedback discussed in class.

## Cultural Consideration Checklist for Feedback

- Have I considered local cultural references or symbolism?
- Am I respecting traditional Timorese poetic forms and values?
- Have I accounted for potential language differences or multilingual elements?
- Are my feedback and assessment methods culturally appropriate and sensitive?
- Have I recognized and valued unique Timorese perspectives in the poetry?
