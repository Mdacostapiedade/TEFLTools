## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students hesitant to give honest feedback
   - **Solution**: Start with anonymous feedback exercises to build confidence

2. **Challenge**: Feedback is too vague or general
   - **Solution**: Provide sentence starters or a feedback template to guide specific comments

3. **Challenge**: Students focus only on negative aspects
   - **Solution**: Enforce the "feedback sandwich" approach: positive-improvement-positive

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in creating objective rubrics for poetry
   - **Solution**: Focus on technical aspects (e.g., adherence to form, use of literary devices) alongside more subjective criteria

5. **Challenge**: Students struggling to apply feedback to improve their work
   - **Solution**: Model the revision process using a sample poem and incorporate peer editing sessions

6. **Challenge**: Balancing cultural sensitivity with constructive criticism
   - **Solution**: Discuss cultural norms and establish class guidelines for respectful feedback

7. **Challenge**: Time management in feedback sessions
   - **Solution**: Use timed rotations or small group feedback circles to ensure all students participate

8. **Challenge**: Addressing varying levels of poetry knowledge among students
   - **Solution**: Provide a glossary of poetic terms and techniques to reference during feedback sessions
