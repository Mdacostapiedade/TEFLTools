## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students feeling intimidated by creating multimedia projects.
   **Solution**: Start with simple projects and provide clear, step-by-step instructions. Offer examples and templates to guide students.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to technology for multimedia projects.
   **Solution**: Focus on low-tech alternatives like hand-drawn illustrations or collages. Encourage group work to share available resources.

3. **Challenge**: Maintaining focus on poetry while integrating other art forms.
   **Solution**: Consistently bring discussions back to poetic elements and how they are enhanced by other media. Use rubrics that emphasize both poetic and multimedia aspects.

4. **Challenge**: Engaging students who are less interested in visual arts or technology.
   **Solution**: Offer a variety of project options, including those that focus more on performance or written elements. Encourage students to play to their strengths within group projects.

5. **Challenge**: Managing time effectively for complex projects.
   **Solution**: Break larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks with clear deadlines. Provide in-class work time and regular check-ins to monitor progress.

6. **Challenge**: Ensuring all students participate in group activities.
   **Solution**: Assign specific roles within groups and rotate these roles for different activities. Use peer evaluations to encourage active participation from all group members.
