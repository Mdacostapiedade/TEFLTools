# Texts and Excerpts

## Traditional Dadolin Example

```
Ai-funan iha rai-leten,
Ai-abut iha rai-okos.
(Flowers above the ground,
Roots below the ground.)

Ita-nia lian iha ibun,
Ita-nia neon iha fuan.
(Our voice is in our mouth,
Our thoughts are in our heart.)
```

## Contemporary Timorese Poem: "Timor" by Xanana Gusmão

```
Timor, land of the sleeping crocodile
Awakened by the cries of your children
Your mountains cradle ancient stories
Your seas whisper tales of resistance

From Jaco to Oecusse, your spirit endures
Through centuries of struggle and pain
Your heart beats with the rhythm of tebe dai
Your soul dances with the flames of independence

Timor, my home, my love, my pride
Your future blooms like the ai-dak flower
In the hands of your sons and daughters
A new chapter of hope is written
```

# Lecture Notes

## Traditional Timorese Poetry: Dadolin

- Dadolin: A traditional form of Timorese poetry
- Structure: Couplets with parallel construction
- Origins in oral tradition
- Used for storytelling, cultural transmission, and ceremonial purposes
- Often metaphorical, drawing comparisons between natural world and human experience
- Themes: nature, relationships, cultural values, spiritual beliefs

## Contemporary Timorese Poetry

- Emerged during and after the struggle for independence
- Blends traditional forms with modern poetic techniques
- Themes: national identity, resistance, cultural preservation, post-conflict healing

## Comparing Traditional and Contemporary Forms
