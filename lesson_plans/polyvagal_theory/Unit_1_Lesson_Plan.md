# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Polyvagal Theory

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on autonomic nervous system (in Tetum)
- "The Pocket Guide to the Polyvagal Theory" summary (in Tetum)
- Breathing exercise instruction cards
- Stress balls or small objects for grounding exercise

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the basic principles of Polyvagal Theory
- Identify the three neural circuits in the autonomic nervous system
- Describe the functions of the vagus nerve
- Experience and reflect on vagal tone through breathing exercises

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Students pair up and share their personal experiences with stress and relaxation
- Discuss how their body feels during stressful and relaxing situations
- Share some responses with the whole class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Polyvagal Theory
- Autonomic nervous system
- Vagus nerve
- Neural circuit
- Vagal tone

Use visual aids and Tetum translations to reinforce understanding.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Overview of Polyvagal Theory
   - Developed by Dr. Stephen Porges
   - Explains the connection between the autonomic nervous system and behavior

2. Evolution of the autonomic nervous system
   - Three neural circuits: ventral vagal, sympathetic, dorsal vagal
   - Hierarchical response to environmental challenges

3. The vagus nerve and its functions
   - Longest cranial nerve in the body
   - Role in regulating heart rate, digestion, and social engagement

Use diagrams and simplified explanations to convey complex concepts.

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

1. Group sorting activity:
   - Provide cards with various physiological states and behaviors
   - Students sort them into the three neural circuit categories

2. Breathing exercise:
   - Guide students through a simple diaphragmatic breathing exercise
   - Discuss how it affects their state of arousal

## 7. Production Tasks (25 minutes)

1. Small group discussions:
   - Students share examples of how they've experienced different autonomic states in their daily lives
   - Identify common triggers for each state in Timorese culture

2. Role-play:
   - Students act out scenarios demonstrating different autonomic states
   - Class identifies which neural circuit is active in each scenario

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points of Polyvagal Theory
- Students share one new insight they gained from the lesson
- Address any remaining questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Journal entry: Students record their observations of their own autonomic states over the next week
- Read provided Tetum summary of "The Pocket Guide to the Polyvagal Theory" chapter 1

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

1. Polyvagal Theory: A theory explaining the connection between the autonomic nervous system and behavior, developed by Dr. Stephen Porges.

2. Autonomic nervous system: The part of the nervous system responsible for controlling involuntary body functions.

3. Vagus nerve: The longest cranial nerve, playing a crucial role in regulating various bodily functions and social engagement.

4. Neural circuit: A group of interconnected neurons that work together to perform specific functions.

5. Vagal tone: The activity of the vagus nerve, often measured through heart rate variability.

6. Ventral vagal state: A state of calm and social engagement, associated with feelings of safety.

7. Sympathetic state: A state of activation or arousal, associated with fight or flight responses.

8. Dorsal vagal state: A state of shutdown or immobilization, associated with extreme threat or trauma.
