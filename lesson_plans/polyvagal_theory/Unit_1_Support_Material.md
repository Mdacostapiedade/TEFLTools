# Support Material for Introduction to Polyvagal Theory Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

1. Polyvagal Theory: A theory explaining the connection between the autonomic nervous system and behavior, developed by Dr. Stephen Porges.
2. Autonomic nervous system: The part of the nervous system responsible for controlling involuntary body functions.
3. Vagus nerve: The longest cranial nerve, playing a crucial role in regulating various bodily functions and social engagement.
4. Neural circuit: A group of interconnected neurons that work together to perform specific functions.
5. Vagal tone: The activity of the vagus nerve, often measured through heart rate variability.
6. Ventral vagal state: A state of calm and social engagement, associated with feelings of safety.
7. Sympathetic state: A state of activation or arousal, associated with fight or flight responses.
8. Dorsal vagal state: A state of shutdown or immobilization, associated with extreme threat or trauma.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. Autonomic Nervous System Diagram:
   - A simple illustration of the human body showing the three neural circuits:
     * Ventral vagal (green): Face, throat, heart, lungs
     * Sympathetic (red): Whole body, especially limbs
     * Dorsal vagal (blue): Digestive system, lower body

2. Hierarchy of Neural Circuits:
   - A pyramid diagram showing:
     * Top: Ventral vagal (Social engagement)
     * Middle: Sympathetic (Mobilization)
     * Bottom: Dorsal vagal (Immobilization)

3. Vagus Nerve Illustration:
   - A diagram of the human body highlighting the path of the vagus nerve from the brainstem to various organs.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. Autonomic State Identification Worksheet:
   - List of physical sensations, emotions, and behaviors
   - Three columns for students to categorize each item into ventral vagal, sympathetic, or dorsal vagal states

2. Personal Autonomic State Journal:
   - Template for daily entries including:
     * Date and time
     * Current autonomic state
     * Triggers or situations leading to this state
     * Physical sensations and emotions experienced
     * Strategies used to regulate (if any)

3. Breathing Exercise Instruction Card:
   - Step-by-step guide for diaphragmatic breathing
   - Tips for focusing on the breath
   - Space for personal notes on the experience

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Accessing the Healing Power of the Vagus Nerve" by Stanley Rosenberg (summary in Tetum if available)
2. Online guided meditation focused on vagal tone regulation (provide links to Tetum versions if possible)
3. Infographic on "Polyvagal Theory in Everyday Life" (translated into Tetum)
4. List of local mental health professionals familiar with Polyvagal Theory

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggle with scientific terminology
   - Tip: Use simple analogies and relate concepts to everyday experiences in Timorese culture

2. Challenge: Difficulty in identifying personal autonomic states
   - Tip: Provide more concrete examples and encourage pair discussions to share experiences

3. Challenge: Resistance to breathing exercises due to cultural unfamiliarity
   - Tip: Introduce exercises gradually and relate them to traditional Timorese relaxation practices

4. Challenge: Triggering trauma responses during discussions
   - Tip: Establish clear guidelines for sharing, emphasize choice in participation, and have resources ready for additional support

5. Challenge: Applying theory to local context
   - Tip: Actively seek input from students on how concepts relate to their lives and communities in Timor-Leste
