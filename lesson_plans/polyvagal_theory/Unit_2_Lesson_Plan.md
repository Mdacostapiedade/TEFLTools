# Lesson Plan: Neuroception and Safety in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with diagrams of the autonomic nervous system (in Tetum)
- Pictures/videos of Timorese social interactions
- Small objects for creating "safe spaces" (e.g., local textiles, plants, stones)
- Audio recordings of soothing Timorese music

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the concept of neuroception
- Identify cues of safety in Timorese culture
- Describe the role of social engagement in feeling safe
- Practice creating a safe environment

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Students pair up and take turns describing a place where they feel completely safe
- Class discussion: What common elements make these places feel safe?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  - Neuroception
  - Cues of safety
  - Social engagement
  - Autonomic nervous system
- Students create visual representations or gestures for each term

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Lecture and discussion on:
  - Definition and function of neuroception
  - How the autonomic nervous system detects safety and threat
  - Cultural variations in safety cues
  - The importance of social engagement for feeling safe
- Use diagrams and examples specific to Timorese culture

## 6. Practice Activities (25 minutes)

- Small group activity: Analyze photos/videos of Timorese social interactions
  - Identify verbal and non-verbal cues that signal safety
  - Discuss how these cues might differ in other cultures

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- In pairs, students create a "safe space" using provided objects
- Each pair presents their space, explaining the safety cues they incorporated
- Class provides feedback and additional suggestions

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students match safety cues to different parts of the autonomic nervous system
- Class discussion: How can we apply this knowledge in daily life in Timor-Leste?

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Observe and record 5 safety cues in their community over the next week
- Write a short reflection on how understanding neuroception could improve social interactions in their community

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Neuroception: The subconscious detection of safety or danger through environmental and internal cues
- Cues of safety: Signals in the environment that indicate absence of threat and promote calm states
- Social engagement: The use of facial expressions, vocalizations, and listening to connect with others
- Autonomic nervous system: The part of the nervous system responsible for control of bodily functions not consciously directed
