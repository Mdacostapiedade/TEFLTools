   - Students draw lines to match functions with the correct body part/process

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Polyvagal Theory: A Primer for Timorese Contexts" (simplified guide in Tetum)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barrier:
   - Use visual aids extensively
   - Provide key terms in both English and Tetum
   - Encourage peer translation and explanation

2. Cultural Sensitivity:

   - Incorporate hands-on activities and role-play to make ideas more tangible
   - Encourage students to share personal experiences related to the topics

4. Limited Technology:
   - Prepare alternative non-digital activities in case of power outages or lack of equipment
   - Create printed handouts of key visual information from videos or online resources
   - Encourage group work to share available resources effectively

5. Varied Educational Backgrounds:
   - Provide additional support materials for students who need extra help
   - Use peer teaching to leverage diverse knowledge and skills within the class
   - Offer optional advanced readings for students who want to explore topics further
