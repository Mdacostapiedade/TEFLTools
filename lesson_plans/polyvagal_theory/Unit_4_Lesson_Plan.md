# Lesson Plan: Stress Responses and Trauma in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on fight, flight, and freeze responses (in Tetum)
- Images depicting various stress responses
- Natural elements for grounding exercises (e.g., stones, leaves, water)
- Audio recording of traditional Timorese music

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe the physiological states associated with stress and trauma
- Identify common trauma responses in Timorese communities
- Explain how Polyvagal Theory relates to trauma recovery
- Practice basic grounding techniques using local natural elements

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Play a short clip of traditional Timorese music
- Ask students to close their eyes and notice how their body feels while listening
- Discuss how music can influence our physiological state

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Fight response
- Flight response
- Freeze response
- Historical trauma
- Resilience
- Grounding techniques

Use visual aids and Tetum translations to reinforce understanding.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Explain the fight, flight, and freeze responses:
   - Physiological changes in each state
   - Examples of when these responses occur
   - How these relate to the Polyvagal Theory

2. Discuss historical trauma in Timor-Leste:
   - Brief overview of significant events (e.g., colonization, occupation)
   - How collective trauma affects communities
   - Intergenerational transmission of trauma

3. Introduce Polyvagal Theory's perspective on trauma recovery:
   - Importance of safety and social connection
   - Role of the ventral vagal state in healing
   - Concept of co-regulation

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

1. Small group discussion:
   - Divide class into groups of 3-4
   - Each group identifies common stress responses they've observed in their communities
   - Groups share findings with the class

2. Physiological state identification:
   - Show images of people exhibiting different stress responses
   - Students identify which state (fight, flight, or freeze) is being depicted

## 7. Production Tasks (25 minutes)

1. Storytelling exercise:
   - Students pair up and share a personal or family story of resilience
   - Partners practice active listening and supportive responses

2. Grounding technique practice:
   - Introduce simple grounding exercises using local natural elements
   - Students practice techniques in pairs, giving feedback to each other

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Ask students to share one new insight they gained about stress and trauma
- Preview the next lesson on applying Polyvagal Theory in Timor-Leste

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Journal entry:
   - Write about a time when you experienced a stress response
   - Reflect on how understanding Polyvagal Theory might change your perspective on that experience

2. Community observation:
   - Observe and note examples of stress responses and resilience in your community
   - Be prepared to discuss observations in the next class

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Fight response: A physiological state of heightened arousal preparing the body for confrontation
- Flight response: A state of activation that prepares the body to escape from perceived danger
- Freeze response: A state of immobilization or shutdown in response to overwhelming threat
- Historical trauma: Cumulative emotional and psychological wounding across generations
- Resilience: The ability to recover from or adapt to difficult experiences
- Grounding techniques: Practices that help connect a person to the present moment and their physical surroundings
