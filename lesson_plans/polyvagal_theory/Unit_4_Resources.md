# Resources for Learning Unit 4: Stress Responses and Trauma

## 1. Excerpts and Short Stories

### Story of Resilience: "The Tais Weaver"

Maria sat at her loom, her fingers moving deftly as she wove the intricate tais cloth. Each thread represented a story, a memory passed down through generations. As she worked, she remembered the tales her grandmother had told her of the occupation, of hiding in the mountains, of the strength it took to survive.

The rhythmic clack of the loom soothed her, much as it had soothed her ancestors. In this act of creation, Maria found connectionâ€”to her culture, to her history, and to her own inner strength. Though her hands bore the calluses of hard work, they also held the power to create beauty from pain.

As she finished the tais, Maria saw in its patterns the resilience of her people. Like the interwoven threads, the Timorese had come together, supporting one another through hardship. And like the vibrant colors emerging from her loom, hope and healing were possible, even in the aftermath of trauma.

## 2. Lecture Notes

### Fight, Flight, and Freeze Responses

- Definition: Automatic physiological reactions to perceived threats
- Fight: 
  - Increased heart rate and blood flow to muscles
  - Heightened alertness and aggression
  - Examples: Confronting an attacker, arguing forcefully
- Flight:
  - Rapid breathing, dilated pupils
  - Urge to escape or avoid
  - Examples: Running from danger, avoiding conflict
- Freeze:
  - Slowed heart rate, shallow breathing
  - Feeling of paralysis or numbness
  - Examples: Playing dead when faced with a predator, dissociating during trauma

### Impact of Historical Trauma on Timorese Society

- Definition of historical trauma: Cumulative emotional harm from collective traumatic experiences
- Key events in Timor-Leste's history:
  - Portuguese colonization (1515-1975)
  - Indonesian occupation (1975-1999)
  - Internal conflicts and instability
- Effects on Timorese society:
  - Disruption of traditional social structures
  - Intergenerational transmission of trauma
  - Collective hypervigilance and mistrust
  - Resilience and community solidarity

### Polyvagal Theory's Perspective on Trauma Recovery

- Overview of Polyvagal Theory in relation to trauma:
  - Emphasizes the role of the autonomic nervous system in trauma responses
  - Highlights importance of safety and social connection in healing
- Key concepts for trauma recovery:
  - Neuroception: Subconscious detection of safety or danger
  - Social engagement system: Using face-to-face interaction to regulate nervous system
  - Co-regulation: Mutual calming through safe social connection
- Application to Timorese context:
  - Importance of community rituals in promoting collective healing
  - Utilizing traditional practices that enhance social bonding
  - Recognizing cultural expressions of safety and threat

## 3. Discussion Questions

1. How do you see fight, flight, or freeze responses manifesting in your community? Can you share examples?
2. In what ways has historical trauma affected different generations in Timor-Leste? How might these effects differ between older and younger people?
3. What traditional Timorese practices or rituals do you know that might help in trauma recovery, based on what we've learned about Polyvagal Theory?
4. How can understanding stress responses help us be more compassionate towards ourselves and others?
5. What role do you think social connections play in healing from trauma in Timorese culture?

## 4. Writing Exercise Instructions

### Reflecting on Personal Stress Responses

1. Think of a recent situation where you felt stressed or threatened.
2. Write a detailed description of your physical and emotional reactions.
3. Identify which stress response (fight, flight, or freeze) was most prominent.
4. Reflect on how this response affected your ability to think and act in the moment.
5. Consider how you might approach a similar situation in the future, using your knowledge of Polyvagal Theory.

## 5. Assignment Details

### Community Observation Project

Objective: To identify and analyze stress responses and resilience in your community through the lens of Polyvagal Theory.

Instructions:
1. Over the next week, observe interactions and events in your community.
2. Note at least three examples of stress responses (fight, flight, or freeze) you witness.
3. Identify two instances of resilience or trauma recovery in action.
4. For each observation, record:
   - Brief description of the situation
   - Observed physiological or behavioral responses
   - Your interpretation based on Polyvagal Theory concepts
   - Any cultural factors that may have influenced the response
5. Prepare a short presentation (5-7 minutes) to share your findings with the class.

## 6. Additional Materials

### Grounding Techniques Using Local Elements

1. Stone Holding:
   - Find a smooth stone from a nearby river
   - Hold it in your hand, focusing on its weight and texture
   - Imagine your stress flowing into the stone

2. Leaf Breathing:
   - Collect a large leaf from a familiar tree
   - Trace the outline of the leaf with your finger while taking slow breaths
   - Inhale as you move up the leaf, exhale as you move down

3. Water Listening:
   - Sit near a stream or use a bowl of water
   - Close your eyes and listen to the sound of water
   - Focus on the constant flow, letting thoughts pass like the water
