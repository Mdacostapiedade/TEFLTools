# 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students becoming overwhelmed by trauma discussions
   - **Tip**: Regularly remind students of grounding techniques and provide breaks as needed. Have a quiet space available for students who need to step out.

2. **Challenge**: Cultural barriers in discussing mental health
   - **Tip**: Frame discussions in terms of overall well-being and community strength. Use local metaphors and stories to illustrate concepts.

3. **Challenge**: Limited understanding of scientific terms
   - **Tip**: Use simple analogies and visual aids. Relate concepts to everyday experiences in Timorese life.

4. **Challenge**: Resistance to new concepts that seem to conflict with traditional beliefs
   - **Tip**: Present Polyvagal Theory as complementary to, rather than replacing, traditional wisdom. Highlight similarities with local healing practices.

5. **Challenge**: Students struggling to identify personal stress responses
   - **Tip**: Provide numerous examples and encourage peer discussions. Use role-playing exercises to demonstrate different responses.

6. **Challenge**: Difficulty in practicing co-regulation techniques
   - **Tip**: Start with culturally familiar interactions (e.g., traditional greetings) before introducing new techniques. Emphasize the importance of respecting personal boundaries.
