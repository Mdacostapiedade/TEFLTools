# Excerpts and Short Stories

## "The Healing Power of Tebe Dai" by Maria da Costa

Tebe dai, our traditional circle dance, has been a source of strength and unity for generations. As we join hands and move in rhythm, we feel the energy of our ancestors flowing through us. The steady beat of the drums matches our heartbeats, grounding us in the present moment. Our voices rise in harmony, creating a vibration that seems to resonate with the very earth beneath our feet.

In times of hardship, tebe dai has been our refuge. During the occupation, when gathering was dangerous, we would meet in secret to dance. The familiar steps and melodies reminded us of who we were and gave us hope for the future. Even in the darkest times, the circle remained unbroken.

Today, tebe dai continues to heal our communities. As we dance together, young and old, we reaffirm our connections. The worries of daily life fade away, replaced by a sense of belonging and joy. In the safety of the circle, we can be fully present, fully alive.

Tebe dai teaches us the power of co-regulation. As we synchronize our movements and breath, our nervous systems calm. We learn to attune to each other, to move as one. This embodied experience of harmony stays with us long after the dance ends, helping us navigate life's challenges with greater ease and resilience.

# Discussion Questions

1. How do traditional Timorese practices align with Polyvagal Theory's emphasis on safety and social connection? Can you think of specific examples from your own experience?

2. In what ways has colonization and conflict affected collective nervous system regulation in Timor-Leste? How might we address these impacts using Polyvagal Theory principles?

3. How can we adapt Polyvagal Theory concepts to be culturally appropriate and meaningful in Timorese communities? What potential challenges might arise in this process?

4. Discuss the role of co-regulation in Timorese families and communities. How might this concept be used to strengthen social bonds and promote well-being?

5. How can traditional healing practices in Timor-Leste be enhanced by incorporating Polyvagal Theory principles? What are the potential benefits and risks of this integration?

6. What strategies can be employed to build resilience in Timorese society using Polyvagal Theory? How might these strategies differ in urban versus rural settings?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Journal: Personal Experiences with Co-regulation

Write a 500-word reflective journal entry about your personal experiences with co-regulation in Timorese culture. Consider the following prompts:

1. Describe a specific situation where you experienced co-regulation with family members or in your community.
2. How did this experience affect your physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts?
3. Reflect on how this experience relates to Polyvagal Theory concepts we've discussed in class.
4. Consider how you might intentionally cultivate more opportunities for co-regulation in your daily life.

Use specific examples and sensory details to bring your experience to life. Conclude with insights you've gained about the importance of co-regulation in promoting individual and collective well-being.

# Assignment Details

## Community Workshop Design

In groups of 3-4, design a 30-minute community workshop on stress management using Polyvagal Theory concepts and Timorese cultural practices. Your workshop should include:

1. A brief introduction to relevant Polyvagal Theory concepts (5 minutes)
2. Two interactive activities that demonstrate or practice stress management techniques (10 minutes each)
3. A closing discussion or reflection (5 minutes)

Prepare a detailed outline of your workshop, including:
- Specific objectives
- Materials needed
- Step-by-step instructions for each activity
- Key points to emphasize
- Potential adaptations for different age groups or settings

Be prepared to present a 2-minute summary of your workshop design to the class.

## Resource Guide Creation

Individually, create a one-page resource guide blending Polyvagal Theory with local wisdom for community distribution. Your guide should include:

1. A brief, accessible explanation of 2-3 key Polyvagal Theory concepts
2. Examples of how these concepts relate to Timorese cultural practices or beliefs
3. 3-5 practical tips or exercises for promoting nervous system regulation
4. Relevant local resources or support services

Use clear, simple language and include visual elements (e.g., diagrams, illustrations) to enhance understanding. Consider the literacy levels and cultural context of your intended audience.

# Additional Materials

## Grounding Exercise Using Local Natural Elements

Materials needed: Assorted local natural items (e.g., leaves, stones, flowers, seeds)

Instructions:
1. Invite participants to choose one or two items that appeal to them.
2. Guide them through a sensory exploration of their chosen items:
   - Look closely at the colors, shapes, and textures
   - Feel the weight and texture in their hands
   - Smell any scents associated with the item
   - If appropriate and safe, taste (e.g., an edible leaf or seed)
3. Encourage participants to notice how this sensory experience affects their body and breath.
4. Discuss how connecting with natural elements can help regulate the nervous system and promote a sense of safety and connection to place.

## Traditional Timorese Lullaby for Regulation

"Kole Ona" (Time to Sleep)

Kole ona, kole ona
(It's time to sleep, it's time to sleep)

Toba ona, toba ona
(Go to sleep now, go to sleep now)

Fitun sira nahe ona
(The stars are spread out)

Fulan naroman ona
(The moon is bright)

Kole ona, kole ona
(It's time to sleep, it's time to sleep)

Toba dukur, toba dukur
(Sleep deeply, sleep deeply)

Use this lullaby as an example of how traditional music can be used to promote regulation and a sense of safety. Practice singing it together and discuss its calming effects.
