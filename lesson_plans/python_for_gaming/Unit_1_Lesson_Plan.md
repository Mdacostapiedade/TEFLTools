Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 1: Introduction to Programming and Python, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Programming and Python

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with internet access (one per student if possible)
- Projector or large screen for demonstrations
- Python 3.x installed on all computers
- Handouts with key vocabulary and basic Python commands
- "Think Python" e-book (available free online)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain what programming is and why it's useful
- Install Python on their computers
- Use the Python shell for basic operations
- Write and run a simple Python program

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to brainstorm in pairs: "What tasks do you think computers can do?"
- Have pairs share their ideas with the class
- Discuss how programming is the way we tell computers how to perform these tasks

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Programming
- Python
- Interpreter
- Shell
- Script
- Print statement
- Syntax

Use visual aids and simple examples to illustrate each term.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. What is programming?
   - Definition and importance
   - Real-world examples of programming in Timor-Leste

2. Introduction to Python
   - Brief history and why Python is popular
   - Applications of Python in various fields

3. Installing Python
   - Step-by-step guide to installing Python 3.x
   - Verifying the installation

4. Using the Python shell
   - Opening the shell
   - Basic operations (arithmetic, printing)

5. Writing and running a simple program
   - Creating a Python file
   - Writing a "Hello World" program
   - Running the program from the command line

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Python shell exploration:
   - Have students experiment with basic arithmetic operations in the shell
   - Challenge them to print their name using the print() function

2. First Python script:
   - Guide students through creating a new Python file
   - Have them write a program that prints "Bondia Timor-Leste!"
   - Help students run their program and troubleshoot any issues

## 7. Production Tasks (20 minutes)

1. Modify the "Bondia Timor-Leste!" program to:
   - Print multiple lines
   - Include the current date (students can research how to do this)

2. Create a new program that:
   - Prints a short fact about Timor-Leste
   - Uses at least one arithmetic operation (e.g., calculating years since independence)

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Address any remaining questions
- Preview the next lesson on variables and data types

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Install Python on a home computer (if possible)
2. Read Chapter 1 of "Think Python"
3. Write a Python program that prints:
   - Your name
   - Your age
   - A fun fact about yourself
4. Bring the program to the next class (either on a USB drive or as a printout)

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Programming: The process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
- Python: A high-level programming language known for its readability and versatility.
- Interpreter: A program that executes Python code directly, without needing to compile it first.
- Shell: An interactive environment where you can enter Python commands and see the results immediately.
- Script: A file containing a program written in Python.
- Print statement: A command in Python (print()) used to display output to the screen.
- Syntax: The set of rules that define how Python programs must be written to be valid.
