# Resources for Learning Unit 1: Introduction to Programming and Python

## 1. Lecture Notes

### What is Programming?

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. It's a way to communicate with computers and make them do useful things for us.

Key points:
- Programs are sets of instructions for computers
- Programming languages (like Python) allow us to write these instructions
- Programming is used in many fields: science, business, entertainment, etc.
- In Timor-Leste, programming is used in areas like agriculture, education, and healthcare

### Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

Key points:
- Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991
- Named after Monty Python's Flying Circus
- Used by companies like Google, NASA, and Instagram
- Great for beginners due to its clear syntax
- Versatile: web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, etc.

### Installing Python

Steps to install Python:
1. Go to python.org
2. Download the latest version of Python 3
3. Run the installer
4. Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"
5. Click "Install Now"
6. Verify installation by opening a command prompt and typing "python --version"

### Using the Python Shell

The Python shell is an interactive environment where you can enter Python commands and see the results immediately.

Key points:
- Open by typing "python" in the command prompt
- Recognizable by the ">>>" prompt
- Great for quick calculations and experimentation
- Exit by typing "exit()" or pressing Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Ctrl+D (Mac/Linux)

### Writing and Running a Simple Program

A Python program is a text file with a .py extension containing Python code.

Steps to create and run a program:
1. Open a text editor (e.g., IDLE, Notepad)
2. Write your Python code
3. Save the file with a .py extension (e.g., "hello.py")
4. Open a command prompt in the same directory as your file
5. Run the program by typing "python filename.py" (e.g., "python hello.py")

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. Why do you think programming is important in today's world?
2. How might programming skills benefit Timor-Leste's development?
3. What are some tasks in your daily life that could be automated with programming?
4. Why do you think Python is a good language for beginners?
5. What challenges might you face when learning to program, and how could you overcome them?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a short paragraph (5-7 sentences) explaining why you want to learn programming and how you think it might be useful in your future career or personal life. Include at least one specific example of how you might use programming skills in Timor-Leste.

## 4. Assignment Details

### "Hello Timor-Leste" Program

1. Create a new Python file named "hello_timor_leste.py"
2. Write a program that prints the following:
   ```
   Bondia Timor-Leste!
   Today is [current date].
   Timor-Leste has been independent for [X] years.
   ```
3. For the current date, use the `datetime` module (research how to import and use it)
4. Calculate the years since independence (May 20, 2002) using Python's arithmetic operations
5. Run your program and make sure it works correctly
6. Submit your .py file or a screenshot of your code and its output

## 5. Additional Materials

### Python Code Examples

1. Basic print statement:
   ```python
   print("Bondia Timor-Leste!")
   ```

2. Using variables:
   ```python
   country = "Timor-Leste"
   print("Welcome to", country)
   ```

3. Basic arithmetic:
   ```python
   population = 1318445
   area = 14874
   density = population / area
   print("Population density:", round(density, 2), "people per sq km")
   ```

### Fun Facts about Timor-Leste for Programming Examples

- Timor-Leste became independent in 2002
- The official languages are Tetum and Portuguese
- The country has 13 districts
- Timor-Leste's highest point is Mount Ramelau at 2,963 meters
- The national animal is the crocodile
