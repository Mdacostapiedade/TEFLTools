# Support Material for Introduction to Programming and Python

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Programming**: The process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
- **Python**: A high-level programming language known for its readability and versatility.
- **Interpreter**: A program that executes Python code directly, without needing to compile it first.
- **Shell**: An interactive environment where you can enter Python commands and see the results immediately.
- **Script**: A file containing a program written in Python.
- **Print statement**: A command in Python (print()) used to display output to the screen.
- **Syntax**: The set of rules that define how Python programs must be written to be valid.
- **Variable**: A named storage location in a program that holds a value.
- **Function**: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
- **Library**: A collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform common tasks.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Programming Concept Diagram**: 
   A flowchart showing the process of writing and running a Python program:
   [Problem] -> [Write Code] -> [Run in Interpreter] -> [Output] -> [Debug if needed]

2. **Python Shell vs. Script Comparison**:
   A side-by-side comparison showing:
   - Python Shell: Interactive, immediate results, temporary
   - Python Script: Saved in a file, can be run multiple times, more complex programs

3. **Basic Python Syntax Poster**:
   A visual guide showing:
   - How to write a print statement
   - Basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
   - How to create a variable
   - How to write a simple function

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Python Installation Guide**:
   Step-by-step instructions for installing Python on different operating systems.

2. **Python Shell Exploration Worksheet**:
   A worksheet with exercises for students to complete in the Python shell, including:
   - Basic arithmetic operations
   - Printing text and numbers
   - Using variables

3. **First Python Script Template**:
   A template for students to fill in to create their first Python script, including:
   - How to start a Python file
   - Where to write the main code
   - How to save and run the file

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Online Python tutorials:
   - Codecademy's Python course: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3
   - Python's official tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/

2. Free e-books:

   - Repl.it Python environment: https://repl.it/languages/python3

4. Local resources:
   - List of tech meetups or coding groups in Dili (if available)
   - Information on local tech companies or NGOs using Python

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students with varying levels of computer literacy.
   **Solution**: Pair more experienced students with less experienced ones for peer support.

2. **Challenge**: Technical issues during Python installation.
   **Solution**: Prepare a troubleshooting guide and have a few pre-configured laptops as backups.

3. **Challenge**: Students struggling with English-based programming terms.
   **Solution**: Create a bilingual glossary of key terms in English and Tetum.

4. **Challenge**: Maintaining student engagement during theoretical parts.
   **Solution**: Use interactive demonstrations and relate concepts to local, real-world examples.

5. **Challenge**: Limited internet access for online resources.
   **Solution**: Prepare offline versions of key resources and encourage students to download materials when they have access.

6. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by new concepts.
   **Solution**: Break down complex ideas into smaller, manageable parts and provide plenty of hands-on practice time.

7. **Challenge**: Relating Python to local context in Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Develop a set of Timor-Leste specific programming examples and projects that students can relate to.
