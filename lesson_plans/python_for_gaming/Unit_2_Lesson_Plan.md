Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 2: Variables and Data Types, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Variables and Data Types in Python

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with Python installed
- Projector or screen for demonstrations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with key vocabulary and concepts

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand and use variables in Python
- Identify and work with basic data types (int, float, string)
- Perform basic mathematical operations in Python
- Manipulate strings using Python methods

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to brainstorm different types of information they might want to store in a computer program (e.g., names, ages, prices, etc.)
- Discuss how these different types of information might be represented in a program

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Variable
- Data type
- Integer (int)
- Float
- String
- Assignment operator (=)
- Mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, //, %)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduce variables:
   - Explain what variables are and how they're used to store data
   - Demonstrate creating variables in Python: `x = 5`, `name = "Maria"`

2. Explain basic data types:
   - Integers: Whole numbers, e.g., `age = 25`
   - Floats: Decimal numbers, e.g., `height = 1.75`
   - Strings: Text data, e.g., `city = "Dili"`

3. Demonstrate basic math operations:
   - Addition: `a + b`
   - Subtraction: `a - b`
   - Multiplication: `a * b`
   - Division: `a / b`
   - Integer division: `a // b`
   - Modulus: `a % b`

4. Show string manipulation:
   - Concatenation: `first_name + " " + last_name`
   - String methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.capitalize()`

## 6. Practice Activities (25 minutes)

1. Variable creation exercise:
   - Have students create variables for their name, age, and favorite color
   - Ask them to print these variables

2. Math practice:
   - Provide a set of math problems to solve using Python
   - Include problems using different operators

3. String manipulation:
   - Give students a list of Timorese names and have them manipulate them using string methods

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Area calculation program:
   - Guide students in writing a program to calculate the area of Timor-Leste (14,874 sq km)
   - Have them store the length and width as variables and calculate the area

2. GDP per capita calculation:
   - Provide Timor-Leste's population (1,318,445) and GDP ($2.7 billion)
   - Ask students to create variables for these values and calculate the GDP per capita

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the main concepts covered in the lesson
- Address any questions or confusion
- Preview the next lesson on control flow

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Create a program that converts Timorese centavos to US dollars:
   - Use variables to store the amount in centavos and the exchange rate
   - Calculate and print the equivalent amount in US dollars

2. Write a program that takes a person's name and age as input, then prints a greeting including their name and how old they'll be next year

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Variable: A named storage location in a program that holds a value
- Data type: A classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data
- Integer (int): A whole number, positive or negative, without decimals
- Float: A number with a decimal point
- String: A sequence of characters, typically used to represent text
- Assignment operator (=): Used to assign a value to a variable
- Mathematical operators: Symbols used to perform mathematical operations (+, -, *, /, //, %)
