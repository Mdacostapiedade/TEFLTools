Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 3: Control Flow, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Control Flow in Python

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with Python installed
- Projector for demonstrations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with Python syntax for control flow structures

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand and use if/else statements for decision making in Python
- Implement for loops to repeat code a specific number of times
- Use while loops for condition-based repetition
- Apply control flow concepts to solve simple problems related to Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Play a quick game of "Simon Says" to introduce the concept of conditional statements
- Discuss how the game relates to decision-making in programming

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Control flow
- Conditional statements
- Iteration
- Boolean expressions
- Indentation

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### If/Else Statements
- Explain the syntax and purpose of if/else statements
- Demonstrate simple examples using Timor-Leste-related scenarios

### For Loops
- Introduce the concept of iteration
- Explain for loop syntax and usage
- Show examples of iterating over ranges and lists

### While Loops
- Explain the difference between for and while loops
- Demonstrate while loop syntax and use cases

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Students complete a worksheet with simple exercises for each control flow structure
- Exercises include:
  * Using if/else to categorize Timor-Leste districts by population
  * Creating a for loop to print the names of Timor-Leste's national heroes
  * Using a while loop to simulate coffee bean harvesting

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

### Task 1: Leap Year Calculator
- Students write a program to determine if a given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar
- Provide guidance on the leap year rule and necessary conditions

### Task 2: Timor-Leste History Quiz
- Students create a multiple-choice quiz about Timor-Leste history using if/else statements
- Encourage them to include at least 5 questions with feedback for correct/incorrect answers

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the main concepts covered in the lesson
- Address any questions or misconceptions
- Preview the next lesson on functions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Complete any unfinished production tasks
- Write a program that uses a loop to print the multiplication table for the number 7
- Create a simple number guessing game using while loops and if/else statements

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Control flow: The order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed in a program
- Conditional statement: A statement that performs different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false
- Iteration: The repetition of a process or set of instructions
- Boolean expression: An expression that evaluates to either True or False
- Indentation: The spaces at the beginning of a code line, used to determine the block of code in Python
