# Support Material for Control Flow Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Control flow**: The order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed in a program.
- **Conditional statement**: A statement that performs different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.
- **Iteration**: The repetition of a process or set of instructions.
- **Boolean expression**: An expression that evaluates to either True or False.
- **Indentation**: The spaces at the beginning of a code line, used to determine the block of code in Python.
- **If statement**: A conditional statement that executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- **Else statement**: A statement that executes a block of code if the condition in the associated if statement is false.
- **For loop**: A loop that iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, string, or range) a specific number of times.
- **While loop**: A loop that continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Flowchart of an if/else statement:
   ```
   [Start] -> [Condition] --True--> [Execute if block] -> [End]
                  |
                  '--False--> [Execute else block] -> [End]
   ```

2. Diagram of a for loop structure:
   ```
   for item in sequence:
       |
       |--> [First iteration]
       |--> [Second iteration]
       |--> [Third iteration]
       ...
       '--> [Last iteration]
   ```

3. Comparison table of for loop vs while loop:
   ```
   +----------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
   |                |         For Loop          |        While Loop         |
   +----------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
   | Use case       | Known number of iterations| Unknown number of         |
   |                |                           | iterations                |
   +----------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
   | Syntax         | for item in sequence:     | while condition:          |
   |                |     # code block          |     # code block          |
   +----------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
   | Exit condition | End of sequence           | Condition becomes False   |
   +----------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
   ```

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with indentation
   - Tip: Use a visual analogy, like nested boxes, to explain indentation. Encourage consistent use of spaces or tabs.

2. Challenge: Confusion between for and while loops
   - Tip: Provide real-life analogies. For loop: reading a book page by page. While loop: eating until you're full.

3. Challenge: Difficulty with boolean expressions
   - Tip: Start with simple comparisons and gradually introduce more complex conditions. Use truth tables for visual learners.

4. Challenge: Students getting stuck in infinite loops
   - Tip: Teach debugging techniques and how to use print statements to track loop progress. Emphasize the importance of proper exit conditions.

5. Challenge: Applying control flow concepts to real-world problems
   - Tip: Start with simple, relatable examples from daily life in Timor-Leste before moving to more complex programming scenarios.

6. Challenge: Students forgetting to include the colon at the end of control flow statements
   - Tip: Create a mnemonic device or song to help remember the syntax. Encourage students to use code completion features in their text editors.
