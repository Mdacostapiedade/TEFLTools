Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 4: Functions, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Learning Unit 4 - Functions

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with Python installed
- Projector for demonstrations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with function syntax examples
- Currency conversion rates (USD to Timorese centavos)
- List of interesting facts about Timor-Leste

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define and call functions in Python
- Understand and use function parameters
- Implement return values in functions
- Apply functions to solve practical problems related to Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to brainstorm tasks they perform daily that could be considered "functions" (e.g., making coffee, tying shoelaces)
- Discuss how these tasks have inputs (parameters) and outputs (return values)

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Function
- Parameter
- Argument
- Return value
- def keyword
- Indentation

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Defining functions:
   - Explain the syntax: `def function_name(parameters):`
   - Demonstrate creating a simple function that prints "Bondia!"

2. Function parameters:
   - Show how to add parameters to functions
   - Explain the difference between parameters and arguments

3. Return values:
   - Introduce the `return` statement
   - Demonstrate how to return values from functions

4. Calling functions:
   - Show how to call functions with and without arguments
   - Explain how to use returned values

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Basic function creation:
   - Have students write a function that prints their name and district

2. Functions with parameters:
   - Students create a function that takes a name as a parameter and greets the person

3. Functions with return values:
   - Students write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

1. Currency Conversion Function:
   - Students write a function to convert between US dollars and Timorese centavos
   - Provide current exchange rates
   - Encourage students to add input validation

2. Random Fact Generator:
   - Students create a function that returns a random fact about Timor-Leste
   - Provide a list of facts for students to use

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap the main concepts covered: function definition, parameters, and return values
- Ask students to share their currency conversion functions and random fact generators
- Address any questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Create a function that calculates the cost of a phone call based on duration and rate per minute
2. Write a function that determines if a given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar
3. Develop a simple quiz function about Timor-Leste history that asks questions and checks answers

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Function: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task
- Parameter: A variable listed in the function definition
- Argument: The actual value passed to a function when it is called
- Return value: The value that a function sends back to the caller
- def keyword: Used to define a function in Python
- Indentation: Spaces or tabs used to indicate a block of code in Python
