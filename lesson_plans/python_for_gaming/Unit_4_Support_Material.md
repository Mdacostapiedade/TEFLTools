Here's the support material for the lesson on Functions, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Learning Unit 4: Functions

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Function**: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task
- **Parameter**: A variable listed in the function definition
- **Argument**: The actual value passed to a function when it is called
- **Return value**: The value that a function sends back to the caller
- **def keyword**: Used to define a function in Python
- **Indentation**: Spaces or tabs used to indicate a block of code in Python
- **Function call**: The act of using a function in your code
- **Local variable**: A variable that is only accessible within a function
- **Global variable**: A variable that can be accessed from anywhere in the program

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Function Anatomy Diagram:
   ```
   def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
       |          |           |
       |          |           └── Parameters
       |          └── Function name
       └── def keyword
           |
           function body (indented)
               |
               return value (optional)
   ```

2. Function Flow Chart:
   ```
   [Start] -> [Function Call] -> [Execute Function Body]
                                         |
                                         v
   [End] <-- [Use Return Value] <-- [Return Value (if any)]
   ```

3. Comparison of Function vs. Procedure:
   ```
   Function:                 Procedure:
   - Returns a value         - Doesn't return a value
   - Used in expressions     - Called as a statement
   - Example:                - Example:
     result = add(3, 4)        print_greeting("John")
   ```

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Function Syntax Practice:
   - Provide examples of function definitions with missing parts (name, parameters, body, or return statement)
   - Students fill in the blanks to create valid functions

2. Function Creation Worksheet:
   - List of tasks related to Timor-Leste (e.g., calculate coffee harvest yield, convert distances between km and miles)
   - Students write functions to perform these tasks

3. Debug the Function:
   - Provide functions with common errors (indentation, missing colons, incorrect return statements)
   - Students identify and correct the errors

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students confusing parameters and arguments
   - Tip: Use a real-world analogy, like a coffee machine. The machine is designed with certain parameters (water input, coffee grounds input), but when you use it, you provide specific arguments (500ml water, 2 scoops of coffee).

2. Challenge: Difficulty understanding the concept of return values
   - Tip: Use physical demonstrations. Have students "call a function" by giving a classmate a task and an object. The classmate performs the task and "returns" a result.

3. Challenge: Forgetting to indent function bodies
   - Tip: Emphasize the importance of indentation in Python. Use a visual aid that shows how indentation creates "blocks" of code.

4. Challenge: Confusion about local vs. global variables
   - Tip: Use the analogy of a house (function) and a neighborhood (global scope). Variables inside the house are only visible inside, while those in the neighborhood can be seen by everyone.

5. Challenge: Difficulty in deciding when to use functions
   - Tip: Encourage students to look for repeated code or logical groupings of operations. Introduce the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself).

6. Challenge: Students struggling with the abstract nature of functions
   - Tip: Start with very concrete, real-world examples related to Timor-Leste before moving to more abstract programming concepts.
