Students create a more complex list of lists or dictionary of dictionaries containing information about Timor-Leste's districts (e.g., name, population, area)

### Task 2: Tetum-English Translator
Students expand their Tetum-English dictionary and create a simple translation program that allows users to look up words

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the main concepts covered in the lesson
- Address any questions or confusion
- Preview the next lesson on File I/O and Basic Data Analysis

## 9. Homework Assignment

   - Add a new event
   - Remove an event
   - Sort events chronologically
2. Create a dictionary of at least 10 Timorese foods with their main ingredients. Write a program that allows users to:
