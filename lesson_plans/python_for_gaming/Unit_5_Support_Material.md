Here's the support material for the lesson on Lists and Dictionaries in Python, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Lists and Dictionaries Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **List**: An ordered collection of items in Python, accessed by index
- **Index**: A number representing the position of an item in a list, starting from 0
- **Element**: An individual item in a list
- **Dictionary**: An unordered collection of key-value pairs in Python
- **Key-value pair**: A set of two linked data items in a dictionary, where the key is used to access the value
- **Append**: To add an item to the end of a list
- **Remove**: To delete an item from a list
- **Sort**: To arrange items in a list in a specific order (e.g., alphabetical, numerical)
- **Mutable**: Able to be changed or modified (lists and dictionaries are mutable)
- **Immutable**: Unable to be changed (individual strings are immutable)

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. List Diagram:
   ```
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango"]
   
   Index:    0        1         2         3
             |        |         |         |
             v        v         v         v
           +-------+-------+---------+-------+
   fruits: | apple | banana| orange  | mango |
           +-------+-------+---------+-------+
   ```

2. Dictionary Diagram:
   ```
   tetum_english = {
       "bondia": "good morning",
       "obrigado": "thank you",
       "hau": "I"
   }
   
   +----------+---------------+
   |   Key    |    Value      |
   +----------+---------------+
   | bondia   | good morning  |
   | obrigado | thank you     |
   | hau      | I             |
   +----------+---------------+
   ```

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. List Operations Cheat Sheet:
   - Creating a list: `my_list = [item1, item2, item3]`
   - Accessing elements: `my_list[index]`
   - Adding elements: `my_list.append(item)` or `my_list.insert(index, item)`
   - Removing elements: `my_list.remove(item)` or `del my_list[index]`
   - Sorting: `my_list.sort()` or `sorted(my_list)`

2. Dictionary Operations Cheat Sheet:
   - Creating a dictionary: `my_dict = {"key1": value1, "key2": value2}`
   - Accessing values: `my_dict["key"]`
   - Adding/modifying key-value pairs: `my_dict["new_key"] = new_value`
   - Removing key-value pairs: `del my_dict["key"]`
   - Getting all keys: `my_dict.keys()`
   - Getting all values: `my_dict.values()`

3. Practice Worksheet:
   - Create a list of 5 Timorese dishes
   - Write code to add a new dish to the list
   - Write code to remove a dish from the list
   - Create a dictionary with 3 Timorese landmarks as keys and their locations as values
   - Write code to add a new landmark to the dictionary
   - Write code to print all landmarks and their locations

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students confusing list indexing (starting at 0) with natural counting.
   - Tip: Use a visual aid showing index positions under list items. Practice counting from 0 for the first few examples.

2. Challenge: Difficulty understanding when to use lists vs. dictionaries.
   - Tip: Provide real-world analogies. Lists are like a simple shopping list, while dictionaries are like a phone book (name-number pairs).

3. Challenge: Forgetting to use square brackets for list indexing or dictionary key access.
   - Tip: Emphasize the syntax differences between lists and dictionaries. Create a syntax checklist for students to reference.

4. Challenge: Confusion about mutable vs. immutable data types.
   - Tip: Demonstrate how lists and dictionaries can be changed after creation, but individual strings cannot. Use visual metaphors like a box with changeable contents (list) vs. a sealed package (string).

5. Challenge: Difficulty with nested structures (lists within lists or dictionaries within dictionaries).
   - Tip: Start with simple structures and gradually introduce complexity. Use real-world examples like a school with classrooms (outer list) containing students (inner lists).

6. Challenge: Students struggling with dictionary key-value concept.
   - Tip: Use the analogy of a physical dictionary where words (keys) have definitions (values). Practice looking up values by keys in both a real dictionary and a Python dictionary.
