Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 6: File I/O and Basic Data Analysis, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: File I/O and Basic Data Analysis

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with Python installed
- Internet access
- Sample CSV files (Timor-Leste economic data, coffee production data)
- Projector for demonstrations

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Read from and write to text files using Python
- Work with CSV files in Python
- Perform basic data analysis on local datasets

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students answer questions about file types they're familiar with (e.g., .txt, .csv, .docx)
- Discussion: Why is it important to be able to read and write files in programming?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- File I/O
- CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- Data analysis
- File handling
- Parsing

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Reading and writing text files
   - Demonstrate opening, reading, and closing a file
   - Show how to write to a file
   - Explain file modes (read, write, append)

2. Working with CSV files
   - Introduce the CSV module
   - Demonstrate reading a CSV file
   - Show how to write data to a CSV file

3. Basic data analysis
   - Explain the concept of data analysis
   - Demonstrate calculating averages from CSV data
   - Show how to find maximum and minimum values

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Text file exercise:
   - Students write a program to create a text file, write their name and favorite Timorese dish to it, then read and print the contents

2. CSV reading exercise:
   - Provide a CSV file with Timor-Leste district populations
   - Students write a program to read the file and print each district's name and population

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

1. Timor-Leste Economic Data Analysis:
   - Provide a CSV file with economic indicators for Timor-Leste over several years
   - Students write a program to calculate and print the average GDP growth rate

2. Coffee Production Analysis:
   - Provide a CSV file with coffee production data from different regions of Timor-Leste
   - Students write a program to find and print the region with the highest coffee production

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the main concepts covered in the lesson
- Address any questions or difficulties students encountered
- Preview the next lesson on libraries and APIs

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Create a program that:
   - Reads a CSV file of monthly rainfall data for Dili
   - Calculates the average rainfall for each season
   - Writes the results to a new CSV file

2. Research and write a short paragraph on how data analysis could be used to improve agriculture in Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- File I/O: Input/Output operations for reading from and writing to files
- CSV: Comma-Separated Values, a simple file format for storing tabular data
- Data analysis: The process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information
- File handling: The process of working with files in a program, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files
- Parsing: The process of analyzing a string of symbols in computer language
