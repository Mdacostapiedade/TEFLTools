Here's the support material for the lesson on File I/O and Basic Data Analysis, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material: File I/O and Basic Data Analysis

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **File I/O**: Input/Output operations for reading from and writing to files
- **CSV**: Comma-Separated Values, a simple file format for storing tabular data
- **Data analysis**: The process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information
- **File handling**: The process of working with files in a program, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files
- **Parsing**: The process of analyzing a string of symbols in computer language
- **File mode**: A parameter that specifies how a file should be opened (e.g., read, write, append)
- **Buffer**: A temporary storage area for data being read from or written to a file
- **EOF**: End of File, a condition that occurs when all data has been read from a file

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. File I/O Process Diagram:
   - A flowchart showing the steps of opening, reading/writing, and closing a file
   - Includes decision points for different file modes (read, write, append)

2. CSV File Structure:
   - A visual representation of a CSV file, showing rows and columns
   - Highlights the header row and demonstrates how data is separated by commas

3. Data Analysis Workflow:
   - A circular diagram showing the steps of data analysis:
     1. Data collection
     2. Data cleaning
     3. Data processing
     4. Data visualization
     5. Interpretation
   - Arrows connecting each step to show the iterative nature of the process

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. File I/O Cheat Sheet:
   - Quick reference guide for common file operations in Python
   - Includes code snippets for opening, reading, writing, and closing files

2. CSV Manipulation Exercise:
   - Provides a sample CSV file with Timor-Leste coffee production data
   - Tasks include reading the file, calculating totals, and writing results to a new file

3. Data Analysis Practice:
   - Worksheet with economic data from Timor-Leste
   - Guided exercises on calculating averages, finding maximum/minimum values, and basic trend analysis

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with file paths
   - Tip: Teach the concept of relative and absolute paths. Encourage using relative paths for portability.

2. Challenge: Encoding issues with non-English characters
   - Tip: Introduce the concept of file encoding. Demonstrate how to specify encoding when opening files (e.g., `open(file, encoding='utf-8')`).

3. Challenge: Difficulty understanding CSV structure
   - Tip: Use visual aids and real-world examples. Show how spreadsheet software displays CSV files.

4. Challenge: Students overwhelmed by data analysis concepts
   - Tip: Start with simple analyses (e.g., calculating averages) and gradually introduce more complex concepts.

5. Challenge: Limited access to local datasets
   - Tip: Prepare a variety of Timor-Leste related datasets in advance. Encourage students to collect their own data if possible.

6. Challenge: Varying levels of math proficiency among students
   - Tip: Provide additional resources for basic statistical concepts. Pair students with different strengths for group activities.

7. Challenge: Students having trouble with error handling in file operations
   - Tip: Introduce try-except blocks early. Demonstrate common file-related errors and how to handle them gracefully.
