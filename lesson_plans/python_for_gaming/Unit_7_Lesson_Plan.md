Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 7: Introduction to Libraries and APIs, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Libraries and APIs

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with Python 3.x installed
- Internet access
- Projector for demonstrations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with API documentation for a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand the concept of libraries and APIs in Python
- Install and import external libraries
- Use the requests library to make API calls
- Parse JSON data returned from an API
- Create a simple data visualization using matplotlib

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to brainstorm different types of information they might want to retrieve from the internet programmatically (e.g., weather data, currency exchange rates, news headlines)
- Discuss how this information might be useful in Python programs

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Library
- API (Application Programming Interface)
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- HTTP request
- Data visualization

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduction to Libraries
   - Explain what libraries are and why they're useful
   - Demonstrate how to install a library using pip
   - Show how to import a library in Python

2. Introduction to APIs
   - Explain what APIs are and how they work
   - Discuss common use cases for APIs
   - Introduce the concept of HTTP requests (GET, POST)

3. Using the requests Library
   - Demonstrate how to make a simple GET request
   - Show how to handle responses and error checking

4. Working with JSON Data
   - Explain JSON format and its importance in APIs
   - Show how to parse JSON data in Python

5. Introduction to matplotlib
   - Briefly introduce matplotlib for data visualization
   - Demonstrate a simple plot creation

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Library Installation
   - Have students install the requests and matplotlib libraries using pip

2. Weather API Practice
   - Provide students with API documentation for a weather API
   - Guide them through making a request to get the current weather in Dili
   - Help students parse the JSON response and extract relevant information

3. Basic Data Visualization
   - Provide a small dataset of Timor-Leste statistics (e.g., population by district)
   - Guide students in creating a simple bar chart using matplotlib

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Weather Application
   - Students create a program that asks for a city in Timor-Leste and displays the current weather
   - Encourage students to add features like temperature conversion or weather descriptions

2. Timor-Leste Data Visualization
   - Students choose a dataset related to Timor-Leste (e.g., coffee production, literacy rates)
   - Create a meaningful visualization using matplotlib

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the main concepts covered: libraries, APIs, JSON, and data visualization
- Address any questions or challenges students encountered
- Preview how these concepts will be applied in the final project

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. API Exploration:
   - Research and find an API related to a topic of interest in Timor-Leste
   - Write a short proposal on how this API could be used in a Python program

2. Data Visualization Practice:
   - Find a dataset related to Timor-Leste
   - Create at least two different types of visualizations using matplotlib
   - Write a brief explanation of what the visualizations reveal about the data

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Library: A collection of pre-written code that can be used to extend Python's capabilities
- API: A set of protocols and tools for building software applications
- JSON: A lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate
- HTTP request: A message sent by a client to a server to request specific information or action
- Data visualization: The graphical representation of information and data using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps
