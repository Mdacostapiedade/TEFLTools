Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 8: Final Project, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Learning Unit 8 - Final Project

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with internet access for each student or group
- Python 3.x installed on each computer
- Text editors (e.g., IDLE, Visual Studio Code)
- Projector for presentations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with project guidelines and rubric

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this unit, students will be able to:
- Apply Python programming concepts to solve a real-world problem in Timor-Leste
- Collaborate effectively in a team to develop a larger program
- Plan, implement, and present a Python-based project

## 3. Warm-up Activity (15 minutes)

- Brainstorming session: In small groups, students discuss local issues in Timor-Leste that could potentially be addressed using Python programming.
- Each group shares their top idea with the class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (20 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Project management
- Agile development
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- User stories
- Version control (e.g., Git)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

- Explain the final project requirements and expectations
- Discuss project planning techniques and tools
- Demonstrate how to break down a large project into smaller, manageable tasks
- Show examples of successful Python projects addressing local issues

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Students form project groups (3-4 members each)
- Groups begin project planning:
  - Define project goals and objectives
  - Create a list of features for their MVP
  - Assign roles and responsibilities within the team

## 7. Production Tasks (Remainder of the unit - multiple sessions)

- Groups work on developing their Python projects
- Regular check-ins with the instructor to discuss progress and challenges
- Peer review sessions where groups present their work-in-progress to other teams for feedback

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (Final session of the unit)

- Each group presents their final project to the class and invited community members
- Q&A session after each presentation
- Class discussion on lessons learned and potential future improvements for each project

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Individual reflection paper (500 words) on the project experience, including:
  - Challenges faced and how they were overcome
  - Key learnings from the project
  - Ideas for further development of the project

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Project management: The process of planning, organizing, and overseeing the completion of a project
- Agile development: An iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP): A version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development
- User stories: Short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability
- Version control: A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later
