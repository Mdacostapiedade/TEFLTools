## Practical Experience and Community Engagement

- Invite local tech professionals to give guest lectures
- Organize a "code for good" hackathon focused on local issues
- Encourage students to participate in online Python forums and communities
- Facilitate internships or job shadowing with local tech companies or NGOs using Python

## Additional Resources

- Codecademy Python course
- Python documentation (docs.python.org)
- PyLadies Dili (if a chapter exists or can be started)
- Local tech meetups or coding groups in Dili

This syllabus aims to teach Python programming while incorporating culturally relevant examples and addressing local needs in Timor-Leste. It encourages practical application and community engagement to make the learning experience more meaningful for Timorese students.

# Learning Unit 8: Final Project - Detailed Resources

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Project Planning

#### Introduction to Project Management
- Definition: The application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements.
- Key components:
  - Initiating
  - Planning
  - Executing
  - Monitoring and Controlling
  - Closing

#### Agile Development
- An iterative approach to software development
- Emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery
- Key principles:
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change over following a plan

#### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Definition: A version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future development
- Benefits:
  - Faster time to market
  - Reduced development costs
  - Early user feedback
  - Focus on core functionality

### Implementing a Larger Program

#### Breaking Down the Project
- Use of user stories to define features
- Creating a product backlog
- Prioritizing tasks
- Estimating time and effort

#### Version Control with Git
- Basic Git commands:
  - git init
  - git add
  - git commit
  - git push
  - git pull
- Creating and managing branches
- Collaborating using GitHub or similar platforms

#### Code Organization and Best Practices
- Modular programming
- Consistent naming conventions
- Commenting and documentation
- Error handling and logging

### Presenting Results

#### Effective Presentation Techniques
- Structure: Introduction, Body, Conclusion
- Visual aids: slides, demos, diagrams
- Engaging the audience: storytelling, analogies
- Handling Q&A

#### Demo Best Practices
- Prepare a script
- Test thoroughly before presentation
- Have a backup plan for technical issues
- Focus on key features and benefits

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How can we ensure our project addresses a real need in Timor-Leste?
2. What are the potential challenges we might face when implementing our project, and how can we overcome them?
3. How can we make our project sustainable beyond this course?
4. What ethical considerations should we keep in mind when developing our project?
5. How can we effectively divide tasks among team members to ensure everyone contributes meaningfully?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a project proposal (500-750 words) that includes:
1. Project title
2. Problem statement
3. Proposed solution
4. Target audience
5. Key features of the MVP
6. Potential challenges and mitigation strategies
7. Timeline and milestones
8. Required resources

## 4. Assignment Details

### Final Project Guidelines

#### Objective
Develop a Python program that addresses a local issue in Timor-Leste.

#### Requirements
1. Use Python 3.x
2. Implement at least three concepts learned in the course (e.g., functions, lists, file I/O)
3. Include a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI)
4. Incorporate error handling and input validation
5. Include comments and documentation
6. Use version control (Git) throughout development

#### Deliverables
1. Source code (submitted via GitHub)
2. User manual (PDF)
3. Project presentation (10-15 minutes)
4. Individual reflection paper (500 words)

#### Grading Rubric
- Functionality (40%)
- Code quality and organization (20%)
- User interface and experience (15%)
- Documentation (10%)
- Presentation (10%)
- Individual reflection (5%)
