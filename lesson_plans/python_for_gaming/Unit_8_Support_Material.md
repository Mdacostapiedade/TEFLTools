## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to come up with project ideas.
   **Solution**: Provide a list of sample project ideas relevant to Timor-Leste, or invite local organizations to present real problems they face.

2. **Challenge**: Uneven distribution of work within teams.
   **Solution**: Implement daily stand-up meetings and use a task board to visualize work distribution. Encourage rotation of roles within the team.

3. **Challenge**: Students getting stuck on technical issues.
   **Solution**: Set up a "help desk" during class where students can get one-on-one assistance. Encourage peer teaching and problem-solving.

4. **Challenge**: Scope creep in projects.
   **Solution**: Emphasize the importance of MVP and help students prioritize features. Teach them to use a product backlog to manage features.

5. **Challenge**: Difficulty in presenting technical projects.
   **Solution**: Provide a presentation template and conduct a workshop on effective presentation skills. Encourage practice runs with peer feedback.

6. **Challenge**: Integrating various Python concepts into a cohesive project.
   **Solution**: Offer code review sessions where you can guide students in refactoring and improving their code structure.
