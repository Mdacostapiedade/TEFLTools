Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 1: Introduction to Python and Game Concepts, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Python and Game Concepts

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with Python 3.x and Pygame installed
- Projector or large screen for demonstrations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with basic Python syntax and Pygame installation instructions
- Internet access for online resources

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand and use basic Python syntax and data types
- Explain fundamental game development concepts
- Set up a Python and Pygame development environment
- Create a simple "Hello, Timor-Leste!" program using Python and Pygame

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to share their favorite video games and what they like about them
- Discuss how these games might be created, introducing the idea of programming

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Python
- Pygame
- Variable
- Data type
- Operator
- Game loop

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduction to Python
   - Brief history and importance of Python
   - Basic syntax: indentation, comments, print statements

2. Python Data Types and Variables
   - Demonstrate integers, floats, strings, and booleans
   - Show how to declare and use variables

3. Basic Operators in Python
   - Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %)
   - Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)

4. Introduction to Pygame
   - Explain what Pygame is and its purpose in game development
   - Show how to import and initialize Pygame

5. Game Loop Concept
   - Explain the importance of the game loop in game development
   - Demonstrate a basic game loop structure

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Python Basics Exercise:
   - Have students write simple Python statements using variables and operators
   - Create a program that calculates the area of a rectangle

2. Pygame Setup:
   - Guide students through the process of installing Pygame
   - Help troubleshoot any installation issues

## 7. Production Task (20 minutes)

Create a "Hello, Timor-Leste!" program:
- Students will write a Python script using Pygame to display "Hello, Timor-Leste!" on the screen
- Encourage students to customize the text color and background

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the key concepts covered in the lesson
- Address any questions or concerns from students
- Preview the next lesson on drawing and animation

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Complete the "Hello, Timor-Leste!" program if not finished in class
2. Write a short Python program that:
   - Asks for the user's name and age
   - Calculates and prints the year when the user will turn 100 years old

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Python: A high-level programming language used for various applications, including game development
- Pygame: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games
- Variable: A container for storing data values in programming
- Data type: A classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data
- Operator: A symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations
- Game loop: A programming pattern that continually processes user input, updates game state, and renders the game
