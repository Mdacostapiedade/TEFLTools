Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 2: Drawing and Animation, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Drawing and Animation with Pygame

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with Python and Pygame installed
- Projector for demonstrations
- Digital images of Timor-Leste flag and tais patterns
- Handouts with Pygame drawing function reference

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Use Pygame drawing functions to create basic shapes
- Load and display images in a Pygame window
- Implement simple animation techniques using Pygame

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show students various digital images of Timor-Leste flag and tais patterns
- Ask students to identify basic shapes within these images
- Discuss how these images could be broken down into programmable elements

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Surface
- Rect
- Blit
- Frame rate
- Sprite

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Drawing Shapes
- Demonstrate Pygame's drawing functions:
  * `pygame.draw.rect()`
  * `pygame.draw.circle()`
  * `pygame.draw.line()`
- Show how to set colors using RGB values

### Loading and Displaying Images
- Explain `pygame.image.load()` function
- Demonstrate how to create a surface from an image
- Show how to use `blit()` to draw the image on the screen

### Basic Animation
- Explain the concept of frame rate
- Demonstrate moving a shape across the screen
- Show how to create a simple animation loop

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Students practice drawing various shapes using Pygame functions
- Guide students in loading and displaying a simple image
- Have students create a basic animation of a moving shape

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

### Task 1: Draw Timor-Leste Flag
- Students use Pygame drawing functions to recreate the Timor-Leste flag

### Task 2: Animate Tais Pattern
- Students load a tais pattern image and create a simple animation (e.g., moving or rotating the pattern)

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the main concepts covered in the lesson
- Address any questions or difficulties encountered during the activities
- Preview the next lesson on user input and game controls

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Complete the Timor-Leste flag drawing if not finished in class
- Experiment with animating different shapes or images
- Research and write a short paragraph on the significance of tais patterns in Timorese culture

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- **Surface**: A Pygame object representing a rectangular area on which you can draw
- **Rect**: A rectangle, used for drawing shapes and detecting collisions
- **Blit**: The action of drawing one surface onto another
- **Frame rate**: The frequency at which frames are displayed in an animation
- **Sprite**: A 2D image or animation that is integrated into a larger scene
