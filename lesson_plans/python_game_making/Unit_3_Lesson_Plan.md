Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 3: User Input and Game Controls, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: User Input and Game Controls

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with Python and Pygame installed
- Projector for demonstrations
- Handouts with Pygame event handling code snippets
- Simple sprite images (e.g., local Timorese character or object)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand and implement Pygame event handling
- Handle keyboard and mouse input in a Pygame program
- Create basic player movement using input controls

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz on previous lessons' content (Python basics, Pygame setup)
- Brief discussion on different types of game controls students have experienced

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Event handling
- Keyboard events
- Mouse events
- Game loop
- Sprite

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduction to Pygame event handling
   - Explain the concept of events in games
   - Demonstrate basic event loop structure

2. Keyboard input
   - Show how to detect key presses using Pygame
   - Explain key constants (e.g., K_UP, K_DOWN, K_LEFT, K_RIGHT)

3. Mouse input
   - Demonstrate how to get mouse position and button clicks
   - Explain the difference between mouse motion and button events

4. Moving game objects
   - Show how to update object positions based on input
   - Explain the importance of frame rate and delta time

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Guided practice: Students follow along to create a simple program that prints key presses to the console
2. Pair programming: Students work in pairs to modify the program to move a rectangle on screen using arrow keys

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

1. Individual task: Students create a program that moves a sprite (local character or object) using arrow keys
2. Challenge task: Implement diagonal movement and/or mouse control for the sprite

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick recap of key concepts covered
- Q&A session for students to clarify any doubts
- Brief demonstration of a few student projects

## 9. Homework Assignment

Create a simple game where the player controls a character to collect items (e.g., traditional Timorese objects) using both keyboard and mouse input. The game should include:
- Player movement with arrow keys
- Item collection using mouse clicks
- A score display

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Event handling: The process of detecting and responding to user actions or system events in a program
- Keyboard events: Actions related to pressing or releasing keys on the keyboard
- Mouse events: Actions related to moving the mouse or clicking its buttons
- Game loop: A continuous cycle in games that updates game state and renders graphics
- Sprite: A 2D image or animation that represents a character or object in a game
