# Learning Unit 5: Sound and Music - Detailed Resources

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Loading and Playing Sound Files

#### Introduction to Pygame's Audio System
- Pygame uses the `pygame.mixer` module for sound handling
- Initialize the mixer: `pygame.mixer.init()`
- Two main types of audio: sound effects and music

#### Loading Sound Effects
```python
sound_effect = pygame.mixer.Sound("path/to/sound.wav")
```
- Supports WAV, MP3, and OGG formats
- WAV is recommended for short sound effects due to low latency

#### Playing Sound Effects
```python
sound_effect.play()
```
- Can specify loops: `sound_effect.play(loops=1)`
- Control volume: `sound_effect.set_volume(0.5)` (0.0 to 1.0)

#### Loading and Playing Music
```python
pygame.mixer.music.load("path/to/music.mp3")
pygame.mixer.music.play(-1)  # -1 for infinite loop
```
- Best for longer audio tracks (background music)
- Only one music track can play at a time

#### Stopping and Pausing
```python
pygame.mixer.music.stop()
pygame.mixer.music.pause()
pygame.mixer.music.unpause()
```

### Background Music Management

#### Fading Music
```python
pygame.mixer.music.fadeout(2000)  # Fade out over 2 seconds
```

#### Checking if Music is Playing
```python
is_playing = pygame.mixer.music.get_busy()
```

#### Queuing Multiple Tracks
```python
pygame.mixer.music.queue("path/to/next_song.mp3")
```

### Sound Effects for Game Events

#### Creating a Sound Manager Class
```python
class SoundManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sounds = {
            "jump": pygame.mixer.Sound("jump.wav"),
            "collect": pygame.mixer.Sound("collect.wav"),
            "gameover": pygame.mixer.Sound("gameover.wav")
        }
    
    def play(self, sound_name):
        self.sounds[sound_name].play()
```

#### Using Sound Effects in Game Logic
```python
sound_manager = SoundManager()

# In game loop
if player.is_jumping:
    sound_manager.play("jump")
if player.collides_with(coin):
    sound_manager.play("collect")
```

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How does sound enhance the gaming experience? Can you think of examples from games you've played?
2. What are the differences between sound effects and background music in games? How do they serve different purposes?
3. How might we incorporate traditional Timorese music into our games in a respectful and engaging way?
4. What challenges might arise when implementing sound in games, and how can we address them?
5. How can we use sound to provide feedback to the player about game events or their actions?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a short essay (250-300 words) on the following topic:

"The Role of Music in Timorese Culture and Its Potential in Game Development"

Consider the following points:
- Traditional musical instruments and styles in Timor-Leste
- The significance of music in Timorese cultural events
- How Timorese music could be integrated into different game genres
- Potential challenges and considerations when using traditional music in modern games

## 4. Assignment Details

### Individual Assignment: Soundscape Creator

Create a simple Python program using Pygame that serves as an interactive soundscape creator. The program should:

1. Load at least 5 different sound effects related to Timorese culture or nature (e.g., ocean waves, rainforest sounds, traditional instruments).
2. Display buttons or keys that, when pressed, play the corresponding sound effect.
3. Include a background music track that can be toggled on and off.
4. Implement volume control for both the sound effects and background music.
5. Allow sounds to be looped or played once.

Submission requirements:
- Python script (.py file)
- A short README explaining how to use the program and the sources of your sound files
- All necessary sound files

### Group Project: Mini-Game with Audio

In groups of 3-4, create a simple mini-game that incorporates both background music and sound effects. The game should:

1. Have a Timorese theme (e.g., traditional fishing, tais weaving, or a local festival game).
2. Include background music that fits the theme.
3. Have at least 3 different sound effects for game events (e.g., scoring points, losing a life, game over).
4. Implement basic game mechanics learned in previous units.

Submission requirements:
- Python script(s) for the game
- All necessary image and sound files
- A brief game design document explaining the concept and how audio enhances the game experience
