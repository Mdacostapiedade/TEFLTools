Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 6: Final Project - Complete Dodger Game, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Final Project - Complete Dodger Game

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with Python 3.x and Pygame installed
- Text editors (e.g., IDLE, Visual Studio Code)
- Basic image editing software (e.g., GIMP)
- Projector for demonstrations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with game design template and checklist

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Design and plan a complete Dodger game
- Integrate all previously learned game elements
- Customize the game with Timorese cultural elements
- Debug and test their game effectively
- Present and playtest their game with classmates

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Each group brainstorms and sketches a quick design for a Timorese-themed Dodger game
- Groups share their ideas with the class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (15 minutes)

- Game design document
- Sprite sheets
- Game balance
- User interface (UI)
- Playtesting

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Review the core elements of the Dodger game:
   - Player character
   - Falling objects to dodge
   - Scoring system
   - Increasing difficulty

2. Demonstrate how to create a basic game design document:
   - Game concept
   - Gameplay mechanics
   - Visual style
   - Sound design
   - Cultural elements to incorporate

3. Show examples of Timorese cultural elements that can be integrated:
   - Traditional patterns for backgrounds
   - Local characters or symbols for sprites
   - Traditional music for background score

4. Explain the process of integrating all game elements:
   - Setting up the main game loop
   - Creating and managing game objects
   - Implementing collision detection and scoring
   - Adding sound effects and music

5. Discuss debugging and testing strategies:
   - Using print statements for debugging
   - Testing edge cases
   - Getting feedback from peers

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

- Students work individually or in pairs to:
  1. Create a game design document for their Timorese-themed Dodger game
  2. Sketch out the main game elements and UI
  3. Begin implementing the basic game structure in Python

- Instructor circulates to provide guidance and answer questions

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Students continue working on their games:
  1. Implement core game mechanics
  2. Add Timorese-themed graphics and sounds
  3. Test and debug their games
  4. Prepare a brief presentation about their game

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick sharing session: Each student or pair presents their game progress
- Class discussion on challenges faced and solutions found
- Review of key game development concepts covered

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Complete the Dodger game implementation
- Create a short (2-3 minute) presentation about the game, including:
  - Game concept and cultural elements incorporated
  - Challenges faced and overcome
  - Future improvements or extensions

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Game design document: A blueprint that outlines the concept, mechanics, and assets of a game
- Sprite sheets: Image files containing multiple sprites or game objects
- Game balance: The process of adjusting game elements to ensure fair and enjoyable gameplay
- User interface (UI): The visual elements through which a player interacts with the game
- Playtesting: The process of testing a game by playing it to identify issues and improve gameplay
