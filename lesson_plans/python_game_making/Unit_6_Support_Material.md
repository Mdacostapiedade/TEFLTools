## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with game design concepts
   - Solution: Provide more examples of simple game designs and encourage brainstorming sessions

2. Challenge: Difficulty in integrating cultural elements meaningfully
   - Solution: Organize a field trip or invite a local cultural expert to discuss Timorese art and symbols

3. Challenge: Technical issues with Pygame or Python
   - Solution: Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues and set up a peer support system

4. Challenge: Time management in completing the project
   - Solution: Break down the project into smaller milestones and provide a suggested timeline

5. Challenge: Varying skill levels among students
   - Solution: Implement a buddy system pairing more experienced students with those who need extra help

6. Challenge: Limited access to computers or internet outside of class
   - Solution: Provide additional lab time and resources for students who need them

7. Challenge: Difficulty in playtesting and gathering feedback
   - Solution: Organize structured playtesting sessions and provide clear feedback guidelines

8. Challenge: Students focusing too much on graphics and neglecting gameplay
   - Solution: Emphasize the importance of core gameplay mechanics and provide simple placeholder graphics
