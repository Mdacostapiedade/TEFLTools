Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 1: Introduction to Python and Basic Syntax, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Python and Basic Syntax

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with internet access (one per student or pair)
- Python 3.x installed on each computer
- IDLE or a text editor installed on each computer
- Projector or large screen for demonstrations
- Handouts with basic Python syntax and common Timorese goods prices

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain what Python is and its applications in Timor-Leste
- Set up a Python development environment on their computers
- Write and run simple Python programs using basic syntax

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Group discussion: "What do you know about computer programming?"
- Brainstorm potential uses of programming in Timor-Leste

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Python
- Programming language
- Variable
- Data type
- Operator
- IDLE

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### a. Overview of Python
- Brief history and creator
- Python's popularity and uses
- Potential applications in Timor-Leste (e.g., data analysis for agriculture, web development for tourism)

### b. Installing Python and IDLE
- Demonstrate the installation process
- Guide students through installation on their computers

### c. Basic Python Syntax
- Variables and assignment
- Data types: int, float, str, bool
- Basic operators: +, -, *, /, //, %, **
- Print function and string formatting

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Guided practice: Write a simple program to print "Bondia Timor-Leste!"
- Individual practice: Create variables for name and age, then print a formatted string

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

Students will write a program to calculate the cost of common goods in Timor-Leste:
1. Create variables for prices of rice, coffee, and tais
2. Calculate and print the total cost of a shopping list
3. Apply a discount and recalculate the total

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz on key concepts covered
- Address any questions or concerns

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Install Python and IDLE on personal computers (if not done in class)
2. Write a program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit
3. Research and list three potential applications of Python in Timor-Leste's development

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Python: A high-level, interpreted programming language
- Programming language: A formal language used to create instructions for computers
- Variable: A named storage location in a program's memory
- Data type: A classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data
- Operator: A symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations
- IDLE: An integrated development environment for Python, used for writing and running Python code
