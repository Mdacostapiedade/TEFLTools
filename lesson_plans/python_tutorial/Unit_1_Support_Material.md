# Support Material for Introduction to Python and Basic Syntax

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Python**: A high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
- **Programming language**: A formal language used to create instructions for computers to execute.
- **Variable**: A named storage location in a program's memory that holds a value.
- **Data type**: A classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.
- **Operator**: A symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations.
- **IDLE**: An integrated development environment for Python, used for writing and running Python code.
- **Syntax**: The set of rules that define how a Python program will be written and interpreted.
- **String**: A sequence of characters, typically used to represent text.
- **Integer**: A whole number without a fractional component.
- **Float**: A number with a decimal point or in exponential notation.
- **Boolean**: A data type that can have one of two values: True or False.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Python Environment Setup Diagram**:
   A flowchart showing the steps to set up Python:
   Download Python → Install Python → Open IDLE → Create New File → Write Code → Run Program

2. **Basic Python Syntax Diagram**:
   A visual representation of Python syntax elements:
   ```
   variable_name = value
   ↑            ↑     ↑
   Identifier   Assignment   Data (various types)
                Operator
   ```

3. **Data Types in Python**:
   A tree diagram showing the hierarchy of basic Python data types:
   ```
   Python Data Types
   ├── Numeric
   │   ├── Integer (int)
   │   ├── Float (float)
   │   └── Complex (complex)
   ├── Sequence
   │   ├── String (str)
   │   ├── List (list)
   │   └── Tuple (tuple)
   ├── Boolean (bool)
   └── Dictionary (dict)
   ```

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Python Basics Cheat Sheet**:
   A single-page reference guide containing:
   - Basic syntax rules
   - Common data types and their declarations
   - Basic operators and their usage
   - Simple print statement examples

2. **Timorese Goods Price List Worksheet**:
   A worksheet with a table of common Timorese goods and their prices, to be used in the production task. Include items like:
   - Rice (per kg)
   - Coffee (per 250g pack)
   - Tais (traditional cloth)
   - Coconut oil (per liter)
   - Bananas (per bunch)

3. **Python Practice Exercises**:
   A set of simple exercises for students to practice basic Python concepts, such as:
   - Creating variables for personal information (name, age, city)
   - Performing basic calculations using operators
   - Formatting and printing strings with variables

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with the concept of variables.
   **Tip**: Use real-world analogies, like a box holding different items, to explain variables.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in understanding data types.
   **Tip**: Provide plenty of examples using local contexts, such as storing prices of local goods or names of Timorese cities.

3. **Challenge**: Syntax errors frustrating students.
   **Tip**: Emphasize the importance of attention to detail and encourage students to read error messages carefully. Teach basic debugging techniques.

4. **Challenge**: Varying levels of computer literacy among students.
   **Tip**: Pair more experienced students with less experienced ones for peer learning. Provide extra support during the Python installation process.

5. **Challenge**: Limited English proficiency affecting understanding of Python documentation.
   **Tip**: Provide key terms and concepts in both English and Tetum. Encourage the use of online translation tools for documentation.

6. **Challenge**: Lack of consistent internet access for some students.
   **Tip**: Prepare offline resources, such as downloadable Python documentation and practice exercises, that students can use without internet access.

7. **Challenge**: Difficulty in seeing real-world applications of Python in Timor-Leste.
   **Tip**: Regularly provide examples and case studies of how Python is or could be used in local industries, such as agriculture, tourism, or local business management.
