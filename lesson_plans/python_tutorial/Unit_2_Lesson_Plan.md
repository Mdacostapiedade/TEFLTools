Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 2: Control Flow, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Control Flow in Python

## 1. Resources Needed
- Computers with Python installed
- Projector for demonstrations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with examples of control flow structures

## 2. Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand and use conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Implement for and while loops for repetitive tasks
- Apply control flow concepts to solve simple problems

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Group discussion: "What are some everyday decisions you make? How do you make them?"
- Introduce the concept of decision-making in programming

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)
Introduce and explain:
- Conditional statements
- Boolean expressions
- Iteration
- Indentation in Python

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
### Conditional Statements
- Explain the syntax and usage of if, elif, and else statements
- Demonstrate with simple examples

### Loops
- Introduce for loops and their syntax
- Explain while loops and when to use them
- Show examples of both loop types

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)
1. Conditional Statements Exercise:
   - Write a program that asks for a user's age and prints whether they are a child, teenager, or adult
2. Loop Exercise:
   - Create a program that prints the first 10 multiples of 3

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)
1. Leap Year Calculator:
   - Students create a program to determine if a given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar
2. Timor-Leste History Quiz:
   - Develop a simple quiz about Timor-Leste's history using conditional statements

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
- Recap key points of conditional statements and loops
- Address any questions or misconceptions
- Preview the next lesson on functions and modules

## 9. Homework Assignment
- Complete the Timor-Leste History Quiz program started in class
- Create a program that uses a loop to print the lyrics of a traditional Timorese song

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Conditional Statement: A programming construct that performs different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false
- Boolean Expression: An expression that evaluates to either True or False
- Iteration: The repetition of a process in a computer program
- Indentation: The spaces at the beginning of a code line, used in Python to define code blocks
