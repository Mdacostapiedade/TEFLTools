Here's the support material for the Control Flow lesson plan, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Control Flow Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Conditional Statement**: A programming construct that performs different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.
- **Boolean Expression**: An expression that evaluates to either True or False.
- **If Statement**: A conditional statement that executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- **Elif Statement**: Short for "else if," it's used to check multiple conditions after an initial if statement.
- **Else Statement**: A part of a conditional statement that executes when the if (and elif, if present) conditions are false.
- **Loop**: A programming construct that repeats a block of code multiple times.
- **For Loop**: A loop that iterates over a sequence (like a list or string) or range of numbers.
- **While Loop**: A loop that continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true.
- **Iteration**: The process of repeating a set of instructions multiple times.
- **Indentation**: The spaces at the beginning of a code line, used in Python to define code blocks.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Flowchart of If-Elif-Else Statement:
   [Description: A flowchart showing the flow of execution in an if-elif-else statement. It starts with a diamond shape labeled "if condition", with arrows pointing to rectangles for "True" and "False" outcomes. The "False" arrow leads to another diamond for "elif condition", and so on, ending with an "else" rectangle.]

2. Loop Visualization:
   [Description: Two side-by-side diagrams. The left shows a "For Loop" as a circle with an arrow pointing back to itself, labeled with "iterate over sequence". The right shows a "While Loop" as a circle with an arrow pointing back to itself, labeled with "condition true".]

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Conditional Statements Practice Sheet:
   - Contains 5 scenarios requiring if-elif-else statements.
   - Example: "Write a program that takes a student's score and prints their grade (A, B, C, D, or F)."

2. Loop Exercises Worksheet:
   - Includes 3 for loop and 3 while loop exercises.
   - Example: "Use a for loop to print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence."

3. Timor-Leste Quiz Template:
   - Provides a structure for students to create their history quiz.
   - Includes placeholders for questions, answer options, and correct answer checking.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with indentation in Python.
   **Tip**: Emphasize the importance of consistent indentation. Use a code editor that shows indentation guides. Practice identifying and fixing indentation errors together.

2. **Challenge**: Confusion between = (assignment) and == (comparison) operators.
   **Tip**: Clearly explain the difference and provide plenty of examples. Create exercises specifically focused on using these operators correctly.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty in choosing between for and while loops.
   **Tip**: Provide clear guidelines on when to use each type of loop. Create comparison exercises where students decide which loop is more appropriate for different scenarios.

4. **Challenge**: Students creating infinite loops accidentally.
   **Tip**: Teach debugging techniques and how to recognize infinite loops. Show how to use break statements and ensure loop conditions eventually become false.

5. **Challenge**: Trouble with nested conditional statements.
   **Tip**: Start with simple conditionals and gradually introduce nesting. Use visual aids like indented bullet points to represent nested structures before writing code.
