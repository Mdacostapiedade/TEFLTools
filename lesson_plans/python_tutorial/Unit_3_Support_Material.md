Here's the support material for the lesson on Functions and Modules, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Functions and Modules Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Function**: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task
- **Parameter**: A variable in the function definition that accepts input values
- **Argument**: The actual value passed to a function when it is called
- **Return value**: The output of a function, specified by the `return` statement
- **Module**: A file containing Python definitions and statements, which can be imported and used in other programs
- **Import**: The process of bringing functions or variables from a module into the current program
- **Def**: The keyword used to define a function in Python
- **Return**: The keyword used to specify the output of a function
- **Built-in function**: A function that is already defined in Python and ready to use
- **User-defined function**: A function created by the programmer to perform a specific task

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Function Anatomy Diagram:
   - A visual representation of a function, labeled with its components:
     - Function name
     - Parameters
     - Function body
     - Return statement

2. Module Import Flowchart:
   - A flowchart showing the process of importing and using modules:
     - Start
     - Import module
     - Access functions/variables from module
     - Use in program
     - End

3. Function vs. Module Comparison Chart:
   - A side-by-side comparison of functions and modules, highlighting their characteristics and uses

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Function Syntax Cheat Sheet:
   - Examples of function definitions with different numbers of parameters
   - Examples of function calls with and without arguments
   - Common built-in functions and their uses

2. Module Import Practice Sheet:
   - Examples of different ways to import modules
   - Exercises for students to practice importing and using functions from common modules (e.g., math, random)

3. Timor-Leste Themed Function Exercises:
   - Write a function to calculate the area of a coffee plantation given length and width
   - Create a function that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit
   - Develop a function that determines if a given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with the concept of function parameters and arguments
   - Tip: Use real-world analogies, such as a coffee machine that takes different inputs (water, coffee beans) to produce coffee

2. Challenge: Difficulty understanding the difference between returning a value and printing it
   - Tip: Demonstrate the difference by showing how returned values can be used in further calculations, while printed values cannot

3. Challenge: Confusion about when to use functions vs. modules
   - Tip: Explain that functions are for specific tasks, while modules are collections of related functions and variables

4. Challenge: Students having trouble with the syntax of importing modules
   - Tip: Provide a handout with common import patterns and practice exercises focusing solely on importing and using module functions

5. Challenge: Difficulty in coming up with ideas for functions relevant to Timor-Leste
   - Tip: Prepare a list of potential function ideas related to local agriculture, culture, or geography to inspire students

6. Challenge: Students not understanding the scope of variables inside and outside functions
   - Tip: Use visual representations of function "boxes" to illustrate variable scope and explain the concept of local vs. global variables

Remember to adapt these materials and tips to the specific needs and context of your students in Timor-Leste, using local examples and references whenever possible.
