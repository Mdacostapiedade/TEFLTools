Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 4: Data Structures, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Data Structures in Python

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with Python 3.x installed
- IDLE or preferred text editor
- Projector for demonstrations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with examples of lists, tuples, and dictionaries

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand the differences between lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Create and manipulate lists, including using list comprehensions
- Utilize tuples effectively in Python programs
- Create and manipulate dictionaries, understanding key-value pairs
- Apply these data structures to solve real-world problems relevant to Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to brainstorm different types of collections they encounter in daily life (e.g., shopping lists, phone contacts, menu items)
- Discuss how these collections might be represented in a computer program

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- List
- Tuple
- Dictionary
- Index
- Key-value pair
- Mutable vs. Immutable

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### Lists (15 minutes)
- Definition and creation of lists
- Accessing and modifying list elements
- List methods (append, remove, sort, etc.)
- List comprehensions

### Tuples (10 minutes)
- Definition and creation of tuples
- Immutability of tuples
- When to use tuples vs. lists

### Dictionaries (15 minutes)
- Definition and creation of dictionaries
- Accessing and modifying dictionary elements
- Dictionary methods
- Use cases for dictionaries

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. List manipulation:
   - Create a list of Timorese cities
   - Add and remove cities from the list
   - Sort the list alphabetically

2. Tuple practice:
   - Create tuples representing coordinates of important locations in Timor-Leste
   - Use tuple unpacking to assign variables

3. Dictionary exercises:
   - Create a dictionary of Tetum words and their English translations
   - Add new words and modify existing translations

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

1. Tais Shop Inventory (20 minutes):
   - Create a program to manage inventory for a local Tais shop
   - Use a list to store Tais items
   - Implement functions to add, remove, and display inventory

2. Tetum-English Dictionary (20 minutes):
   - Develop a more comprehensive dictionary of Tetum words and their English translations
   - Implement functions to add new words, look up translations, and display all words

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap the main points of the lesson
- Address any questions or concerns from students
- Preview the next lesson on file handling and exception handling

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Extend the Tais shop inventory program to include:
   - Prices for each item
   - A function to calculate the total value of the inventory

2. Create a program that uses a dictionary to store information about Timor-Leste's municipalities, including:
   - Population
   - Area
   - Capital city

3. Research and write a short paragraph about how data structures like lists and dictionaries could be used to solve a real problem in Timor-Leste (e.g., managing agricultural data, tracking health information)

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- List: An ordered, mutable collection of items in Python
- Tuple: An ordered, immutable collection of items in Python
- Dictionary: An unordered collection of key-value pairs in Python
- Index: A number representing the position of an item in a list or tuple
- Key-value pair: A set of two linked data items in a dictionary, where the key is used to access the value
- Mutable: Able to be changed after creation (e.g., lists)
- Immutable: Unable to be changed after creation (e.g., tuples)
