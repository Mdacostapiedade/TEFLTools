Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 5: File Handling and Exception Handling, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: File Handling and Exception Handling

## 1. Resources Needed

- Computers with Python 3.x installed
- IDLE or preferred text editor
- Sample CSV file with Timor-Leste's agricultural production data
- Projector for demonstrations

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Open, read, and write files using Python
- Implement basic exception handling using try-except blocks
- Work with CSV files to analyze data
- Apply error handling to existing programs

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Discuss the importance of file handling in real-world applications
- Brainstorm scenarios in Timor-Leste where reading from or writing to files would be useful (e.g., storing crop yields, managing student records)

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- File handling
- Exception handling
- CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- Try-except blocks
- File modes (read, write, append)

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### File Handling
- Demonstrate opening, reading, and writing to text files
- Explain different file modes (r, w, a)
- Show how to use the `with` statement for file operations

### Exception Handling
- Introduce the concept of exceptions and why they occur
- Demonstrate basic try-except block structure
- Explain common exceptions (e.g., FileNotFoundError, ValueError)

### Working with CSV Files
- Introduce the CSV module
- Demonstrate reading and writing CSV files

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Basic file operations:
   - Write a program to create a text file and write the names of Timor-Leste's districts
   - Read the file and print its contents

2. Exception handling:
   - Modify the previous program to handle FileNotFoundError
   - Add a try-except block to handle potential ValueError when working with user input

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

1. CSV Data Analysis:
   - Provide students with a CSV file containing Timor-Leste's agricultural production data
   - Task: Create a program to read the CSV file, calculate average production for each crop, and write results to a new file

2. Error Handling Implementation:
   - Students revisit a previous program (e.g., currency converter or quiz program)
   - Task: Implement appropriate error handling to make the program more robust

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key concepts of file handling and exception handling
- Discuss challenges faced during the activities
- Address any questions or concerns

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Create a program that:
   - Reads a text file containing a list of Timorese recipes
   - Allows users to add new recipes
   - Implements error handling for file operations and user input
   - Writes the updated recipe list back to the file

2. Research and write a short report on how file handling and data analysis could benefit a specific sector in Timor-Leste (e.g., agriculture, education, healthcare)

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- **File handling**: The process of working with files for reading or writing data.
- **Exception handling**: The process of responding to and managing errors in a program.
- **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**: A simple file format used to store tabular data, where each line represents a row of the table.
- **Try-except blocks**: A programming structure used to catch and handle exceptions in Python.
- **File modes**: Specifiers that determine how a file is opened (e.g., 'r' for read, 'w' for write, 'a' for append).
