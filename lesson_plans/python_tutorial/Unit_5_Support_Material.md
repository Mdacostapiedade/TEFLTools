Here's the support material for the lesson on File Handling and Exception Handling, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material: File Handling and Exception Handling

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **File handling**: The process of working with files for reading or writing data.
- **Exception handling**: The process of responding to and managing errors in a program.
- **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**: A simple file format used to store tabular data, where each line represents a row of the table.
- **Try-except blocks**: A programming structure used to catch and handle exceptions in Python.
- **File modes**: Specifiers that determine how a file is opened (e.g., 'r' for read, 'w' for write, 'a' for append).
- **with statement**: A context manager in Python used for efficient handling of resources like file operations.
- **FileNotFoundError**: An exception raised when trying to access a file that doesn't exist.
- **ValueError**: An exception raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. File Handling Flowchart:
   - Diagram showing the process of opening, reading/writing, and closing a file
   - Include decision points for file existence and different file modes

2. Exception Handling Diagram:
   - Visual representation of a try-except block
   - Show the flow of execution when an exception occurs and when it doesn't

3. CSV File Structure:
   - Visual representation of a CSV file's structure
   - Show how data is organized in rows and columns

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. File Handling Cheat Sheet:
   - Common file operations with code snippets
   - Examples of reading and writing text files
   - CSV file handling with the csv module

2. Exception Handling Practice Worksheet:
   - Exercises to identify potential exceptions in given code snippets
   - Practice writing try-except blocks for common scenarios

3. Timor-Leste Data Analysis Project Guide:
   - Step-by-step instructions for reading a CSV file with local agricultural data
   - Tasks for data manipulation and analysis
   - Guidelines for writing results to a new file

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. File Path Issues:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle with file paths, especially on different operating systems.
   - Solution: Teach the use of relative paths and the os module for cross-platform compatibility.

2. Understanding Exception Types:
   - Challenge: Students might find it difficult to identify appropriate exception types.
   - Solution: Provide a list of common exceptions and their use cases. Encourage students to use `print(type(e))` in except blocks to identify exception types.

3. CSV File Complexity:
   - Challenge: Real-world CSV files can be complex and messy.
   - Solution: Start with simple, clean CSV files and gradually introduce more complex data. Teach data cleaning techniques.

4. Conceptualizing File Modes:
   - Challenge: Students may confuse different file modes and their implications.
   - Solution: Use analogies (e.g., 'r' as reading a book, 'w' as writing on a blank page, 'a' as adding notes to the end of a notebook) and provide visual aids.

5. Overcoming Fear of Errors:
   - Challenge: Students may be intimidated by error messages.
   - Solution: Normalize errors as part of the learning process. Teach how to read and interpret error messages effectively.

6. Applying Concepts to Local Context:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle to see the relevance of file handling in their daily lives.
   - Solution: Use examples and datasets relevant to Timor-Leste. Invite local professionals to discuss how they use data analysis in their work.
