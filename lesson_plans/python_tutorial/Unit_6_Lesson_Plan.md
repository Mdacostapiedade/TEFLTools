Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 6: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

## 1. Resources Needed
- Computers with Python 3.x installed
- IDLE or preferred text editor
- Projector for demonstrations
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with UML diagrams of simple classes

## 2. Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the basic concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Define and create simple classes in Python
- Instantiate objects from classes
- Implement and use attributes and methods in classes

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Group discussion: Ask students to think about real-world objects (e.g., a car, a book) and list their characteristics and actions.
- Introduce the idea that objects have properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)
Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Class
- Object
- Attribute
- Method
- Instance
- Constructor

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Introduction to OOP concepts
   - Explain the benefits of OOP (modularity, reusability, encapsulation)
   - Show how OOP relates to real-world modeling

2. Creating a simple class in Python
   - Demonstrate the syntax for defining a class
   - Explain the `__init__` method (constructor)
   - Show how to add attributes and methods to a class

3. Instantiating objects
   - Demonstrate how to create objects from a class
   - Explain how to access attributes and call methods

4. Example: Create a `UmaLulik` class representing a traditional Timorese house
   - Show how to model attributes (e.g., size, location, materials)
   - Implement methods (e.g., describe(), renovate())

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)
1. Guided practice: Together, create a `Coffee` class representing Timorese coffee
   - Add attributes like origin, roast level, and price
   - Implement methods like describe() and calculate_total_cost()

2. Individual practice: Students create a `Student` class
   - Include attributes like name, age, and grade
   - Implement methods like study() and take_exam()

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)
1. Group project: Design a simple inventory management system for a local coffee cooperative
   - Create classes for `Product`, `Inventory`, and `Order`
   - Implement methods for adding products, updating inventory, and processing orders
   - Present the design to the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
- Recap the main concepts of OOP
- Address any questions or misconceptions
- Highlight how OOP can be applied to real-world problems in Timor-Leste

## 9. Homework Assignment
1. Extend the `UmaLulik` class with additional attributes and methods
2. Create a `TaisShop` class to represent a traditional cloth shop:
   - Include attributes for inventory and sales
   - Implement methods for adding stock, making sales, and generating reports
3. Write a short reflection on how OOP could be used to model and solve a local problem in Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects, defining attributes and methods
- **Object**: An instance of a class, representing a specific entity
- **Attribute**: A variable that belongs to a class or object, representing its properties
- **Method**: A function that belongs to a class, defining the behavior of objects
- **Instance**: A specific object created from a class
- **Constructor**: A special method (`__init__` in Python) used to initialize new objects
