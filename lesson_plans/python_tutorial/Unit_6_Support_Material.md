Here's the support material for the lesson on Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects, defining attributes and methods
- **Object**: An instance of a class, representing a specific entity
- **Attribute**: A variable that belongs to a class or object, representing its properties
- **Method**: A function that belongs to a class, defining the behavior of objects
- **Instance**: A specific object created from a class
- **Constructor**: A special method (`__init__` in Python) used to initialize new objects
- **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class)
- **Inheritance**: A mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. UML Class Diagram:
   - A simple box diagram showing a class with three sections:
     - Top section: Class name (e.g., "UmaLulik")
     - Middle section: Attributes (e.g., "size", "location", "materials")
     - Bottom section: Methods (e.g., "describe()", "renovate()")

2. Object Instantiation Flowchart:
   - A flowchart showing the process of creating an object from a class:
     - Start → Define Class → Call Constructor → Initialize Attributes → Object Created

3. Real-world to OOP Concept Mapping:
   - A diagram showing how real-world objects map to OOP concepts:
     - Car (Object) → Car Class
     - Color, Model (Attributes) → Class Variables
     - Drive, Park (Actions) → Class Methods

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. OOP Concept Matching Worksheet:
   - A table with OOP terms in one column and their definitions or examples in another, for students to match

2. Class Design Template:
   - A blank UML-style diagram for students to fill in when designing their own classes

3. Python Class Syntax Guide:
   - A handout showing the basic syntax for defining a class, adding attributes and methods, and creating objects

4. OOP in Timor-Leste Context Worksheet:
   - A worksheet prompting students to identify real-world objects in Timor-Leste and describe them in terms of OOP concepts

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

2. Book: "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes (Chapter on Classes)
3. Interactive OOP exercises on [Codecademy Python Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)
4. Video series: [Python OOP Tutorials by Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc)
5. Practice problems on [HackerRank Python Classes](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=classes)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling to understand the abstract nature of classes
   - Tip: Use familiar, concrete examples from Timorese culture (e.g., Uma Lulik, Tais) to illustrate class concepts

2. Challenge: Difficulty in identifying appropriate attributes and methods
   - Tip: Encourage students to think about the characteristics and actions of real-world objects before translating to code

3. Challenge: Confusion between class and instance attributes
   - Tip: Provide clear examples of when to use each, and create exercises that highlight the differences

4. Challenge: Trouble understanding the `self` parameter in methods
   - Tip: Explain `self` as a way for the object to refer to itself, and demonstrate how it's used to access object attributes

5. Challenge: Difficulty in seeing the benefits of OOP over procedural programming
   - Tip: Showcase a larger project that demonstrates code organization and reusability benefits of OOP

6. Challenge: Students struggling with Python syntax for class definition
   - Tip: Provide a syntax cheat sheet and encourage pair programming for practice

7. Challenge: Lack of real-world context for OOP in Timor-Leste
   - Tip: Engage students in discussions about how OOP could be applied to local businesses, agriculture, or community projects
