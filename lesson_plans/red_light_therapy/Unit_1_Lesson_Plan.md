# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Red and Near-Infrared Light Therapy

## Resources Needed

- PowerPoint presentation on light therapy basics
- Electromagnetic spectrum chart
- Various light sources (red LED, near-infrared LED, sunlight, etc.)
- Light therapy devices for demonstration
- Handouts on the history of light therapy
- Whiteboard and markers
- Laptop and projector

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Define red and near-infrared light therapy
2. Explain the basic principles of light and the electromagnetic spectrum
3. Describe the historical context and development of light therapy
4. Identify current applications of light therapy in Timor-Leste and globally

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

1. Ask students to share any experiences they've had with light-based healing practices in Timor-Leste.
2. Discuss how sunlight exposure is traditionally viewed in Timorese culture.

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Photobiomodulation
- Wavelength
- Electromagnetic spectrum
- Red light therapy
- Near-infrared light therapy

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Introduction to light therapy
   - Definition of red and near-infrared light therapy
   - Basic principles of light and the electromagnetic spectrum

2. Historical context of light therapy
   - Ancient use of sunlight for healing
   - Development of modern light therapy techniques

3. Evolution of light therapy
   - From sunlight to artificial light sources
   - Advancements in LED and laser technology

4. Current applications
   - Global uses of light therapy
   - Potential applications in Timor-Leste

## Practice Activities (20 minutes)

1. Electromagnetic spectrum labeling exercise
   - Students label different types of light on a spectrum diagram

2. Light source identification
   - Students identify different light sources and their potential therapeutic uses

## Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Group discussion on traditional Timorese healing practices involving light
   - Students share and discuss local practices
   - Identify potential connections to modern light therapy

2. Create a timeline of light therapy development
   - Include historical milestones
   - Add potential future applications in Timor-Leste

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

1. Recap key points of the lesson
2. Q&A session to address any remaining questions
3. Preview next lesson on biological mechanisms of light therapy

## Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a one-page report on a traditional Timorese healing practice that involves light or the sun.
2. Read the provided handout on the history of light therapy and prepare three questions for discussion in the next class.

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Photobiomodulation: The use of light to stimulate, heal, and regenerate tissue.
- Wavelength: The distance between successive crests of a wave, especially points in a sound wave or electromagnetic wave.
- Electromagnetic spectrum: The range of all types of electromagnetic radiation.
- Red light therapy: The use of red wavelengths of light (typically 620-700 nm) for therapeutic purposes.
- Near-infrared light therapy: The use of near-infrared wavelengths of light (typically 700-1100 nm) for therapeutic purposes.
