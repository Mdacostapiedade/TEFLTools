# Support Material for Biological Mechanisms of Light Therapy Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Photobiomodulation**: The use of light to stimulate, heal, and regenerate tissue.
- **Mitochondria**: Cellular organelles responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP.
- **ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)**: The primary energy carrier in cells.
- **Cytochrome c oxidase**: An enzyme in the electron transport chain that is a key photoacceptor for red and near-infrared light.
- **Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)**: Unstable molecules containing oxygen that can damage cellular structures.
- **Nitric Oxide (NO)**: A signaling molecule involved in various physiological processes, including vasodilation and inflammation.
- **Electron Transport Chain**: A series of protein complexes in the mitochondrial membrane that generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.
- **Gene Expression**: The process by which information from a gene is used to synthesize a functional gene product, usually a protein.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with complex cellular mechanisms.
   **Solution**: Use analogies and real-world examples to explain abstract concepts. For instance, compare mitochondria to power plants and ATP to batteries.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty visualizing microscopic processes.
   **Solution**: Utilize interactive 3D models or animations of cells and mitochondria. Consider using virtual reality apps if available.

3. **Challenge**: Connecting light therapy to local health issues in Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Provide specific examples of how light therapy could address common health concerns in Timor-Leste, such as wound healing in tropical climates or pain management for agricultural workers.

4. **Challenge**: Limited prior knowledge of cellular biology.
   **Solution**: Begin with a brief review of basic cell structure and function. Provide supplementary materials for students who need additional background information.

5. **Challenge**: Engaging students with varied learning styles.
   **Solution**: Incorporate a mix of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic activities. For example, use physical models, role-playing exercises, or hands-on experiments with light therapy devices.

6. **Challenge**: Language barriers when introducing scientific terminology.
   **Solution**: Create a glossary with terms in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and mnemonics to help students remember new vocabulary.
