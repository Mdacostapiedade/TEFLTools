# Lesson Plan: Health Benefits and Applications of Light Therapy

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and screen
- Laptops or tablets with internet access (1 per 2-3 students)
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts summarizing key health benefits of light therapy
- Sample light therapy devices for demonstration

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify at least 5 health conditions that can benefit from light therapy
- Explain the evidence supporting light therapy for different medical contexts
- Analyze how light therapy could address specific health issues in Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Students brainstorm health issues common in Timor-Leste, then discuss with a partner. Pairs share their top 3 issues with the class.
- Teacher records responses on the whiteboard for later reference.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

- Introduce and define key terms:
  - Photobiomodulation
  - Wound healing
  - Musculoskeletal conditions
  - Neurological applications
  - Tropical diseases
- Students create a vocabulary chart with definitions and example sentences.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Lecture and discussion on health benefits of light therapy:
  1. Skin health and wound healing
  2. Pain management and musculoskeletal conditions
  3. Neurological and psychological applications
  4. Potential benefits for tropical diseases
- Use slides with visuals and case studies to illustrate each benefit.
- Encourage student questions and discussion throughout.

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- Small group activity: Assign each group a health condition. Groups research evidence for light therapy's effectiveness using provided resources.
- Groups create a brief summary of their findings to share with the class.

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Individual task: Students select a specific health issue prevalent in Timor-Leste and begin developing a presentation on how light therapy could address it.
- Provide a template for the presentation structure.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students answer multiple-choice questions about health benefits of light therapy using a digital polling tool.
- Address any misconceptions or questions that arise from the quiz.

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Complete the presentation on light therapy for a specific Timorese health issue.
- Conduct a literature review of at least 3 scientific studies relevant to the chosen health issue.
- Prepare to present findings in the next class session.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Photobiomodulation: The use of light to stimulate, heal, and regenerate tissue.
- Wound healing: The process by which skin or other body tissue repairs itself after injury.
- Musculoskeletal conditions: Disorders that affect the muscles, bones, and joints.
- Neurological applications: Use of light therapy to treat disorders of the nervous system.
- Tropical diseases: Infectious diseases that are prevalent in or unique to tropical and subtropical regions.
