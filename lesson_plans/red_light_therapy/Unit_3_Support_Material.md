# Support Material for Light Therapy Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Photobiomodulation**: The use of light to stimulate, heal, and regenerate tissue.
- **Wound healing**: The process by which skin or other body tissue repairs itself after injury.
- **Musculoskeletal conditions**: Disorders that affect the muscles, bones, and joints.
- **Neurological applications**: Use of light therapy to treat disorders of the nervous system.
- **Tropical diseases**: Infectious diseases that are prevalent in or unique to tropical and subtropical regions.
- **Light therapy**: The use of specific wavelengths of light to treat various health conditions.
- **Wavelength**: The distance between successive crests of a wave, determining the type and color of light.
- **LED**: Light-emitting diode, a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current passes through it.
- **Inflammation**: The body's response to injury or infection, characterized by redness, swelling, heat, and pain.
- **ATP**: Adenosine triphosphate, the primary energy carrier in cells.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited access to light therapy devices for hands-on practice.
   - Solution: Use simulations or virtual labs, create cardboard mockups of devices, or partner with local clinics for device demonstrations.

2. Challenge: Students struggling to understand the complex biological mechanisms.
   - Solution: Use analogies and simplified diagrams, break down concepts into smaller parts, and provide additional visual aids or animations.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in relating light therapy to local health issues in Timor-Leste.
   - Solution: Invite local healthcare practitioners as guest speakers, use case studies specific to Timor-Leste, and encourage students to interview community members about their health concerns.

4. Challenge: Skepticism about the effectiveness of light therapy.
   - Solution: Present strong scientific evidence, discuss ongoing research, and address common misconceptions directly. Encourage critical thinking and analysis of studies.

5. Challenge: Language barriers when discussing technical terms.
   - Solution: Provide a glossary in both English and Tetum, use visual aids to support explanations, and encourage peer teaching to reinforce understanding.

6. Challenge: Limited internet access for online research.
   - Solution: Prepare offline resources such as downloaded articles and videos, create a class resource library, and organize group research sessions when internet is available.
