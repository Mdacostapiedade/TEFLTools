# Lesson Plan: Dosing and Treatment Protocols for Red and Near-Infrared Light Therapy

## Resources Needed

- Light therapy devices (LED panels and/or laser devices)
- Power meter
- Protective eyewear
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with dosing formulas and guidelines
- Laptops or tablets for research and calculations

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain the key factors affecting light therapy dosing
2. Calculate optimal doses for various scenarios using light therapy devices
3. Describe the biphasic dose response and its implications for treatment
4. Develop a customized treatment protocol for a common health condition in Timor-Leste

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

1. Divide students into small groups
2. Ask each group to brainstorm and list factors they think might affect the dosing of light therapy
3. Have groups share their ideas with the class and compile a master list on the whiteboard

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Power density
- Joules
- Biphasic dose response
- Irradiance
- Fluence

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Factors affecting dose:
   - Wavelength
   - Power density
   - Time
   - Frequency

2. Dosing calculations:
   - Introduce the formula: Dose (J/cm²) = Power Density (mW/cm²) × Time (s) × 0.001
   - Explain typical dose ranges for different applications (e.g., 3-15 J/cm² for skin, 10-60 J/cm² for deeper tissues)

3. Biphasic dose response:
   - Definition and concept
   - Implications for treatment (too little vs. too much)

4. Customizing protocols:
   - Considerations for different skin types
   - Adjusting for various health conditions
   - Frequency of treatments

## Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Dosing calculations (20 minutes):
   - Provide students with various scenarios (e.g., treating acne, muscle pain, wound healing)
   - Have them calculate optimal doses using the provided light therapy devices and power meters

2. Biphasic dose response analysis (20 minutes):
   - Present case studies where treatments were ineffective
   - Ask students to analyze whether the dose was too low or too high and explain their reasoning

## Production Task (30 minutes)

In pairs, students will:
1. Choose a common health condition in Timor-Leste
2. Research appropriate light therapy parameters for that condition
3. Design a treatment protocol, including:
   - Wavelength(s)
   - Power density
   - Treatment time
   - Frequency of sessions
   - Total number of sessions
   - Safety considerations

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

1. Ask each pair to briefly present their treatment protocol
2. Facilitate a class discussion on the similarities and differences between protocols
3. Review key points of the lesson, emphasizing the importance of proper dosing

## Homework Assignment

1. Research a light therapy study relevant to a health issue in Timor-Leste
2. Analyze the dosing protocol used in the study
3. Write a short report (500 words) on whether the protocol could be improved based on the principles learned in class

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Power density: The intensity of light, measured in mW/cm²
- Joules: A unit of energy, used to measure the total amount of light energy delivered
- Biphasic dose response: The phenomenon where too little or too much of a treatment can be ineffective or even harmful
- Irradiance: The power of electromagnetic radiation per unit area, typically expressed in W/m²
- Fluence: The energy delivered per unit area, typically expressed in J/cm²
