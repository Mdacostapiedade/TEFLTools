# Lesson Plan: Device Selection and Usage Guidelines for Light Therapy

## Resources Needed

- Various light therapy devices (LED panels, handheld devices, laser devices)
- Power meter
- Protective eyewear
- Laptop and projector
- Handouts with device specifications
- Whiteboard and markers

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Compare and contrast different types of light therapy devices
2. Evaluate device specifications to determine suitability for various applications
3. Apply criteria for selecting appropriate devices for specific health conditions
4. Demonstrate proper usage and maintenance of light therapy devices
5. Develop guidelines for device selection and use in Timorese healthcare settings

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

1. Divide students into small groups
2. Provide each group with a different light therapy device
3. Ask groups to examine their device and list its features, potential uses, and any questions they have about it
4. Have groups share their observations with the class

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Write the following terms on the whiteboard and briefly explain each:
- LED (Light Emitting Diode)
- Laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation)
- Power density
- Irradiance
- Wavelength
- Treatment area
- Pulsed vs. continuous wave

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. LED vs. Laser Devices
   - Explain the differences in mechanism and application
   - Discuss pros and cons of each type

2. Factors to Consider When Selecting Devices
   - Power output and its importance
   - Available wavelength options and their specific benefits
   - Treatment area size and its impact on efficiency
   - Portability and ease of use
   - Cost and durability

3. Practical Considerations for Timor-Leste
   - Climate impact on device performance and longevity
   - Electricity availability and reliability
   - Maintenance and repair capabilities
   - Cultural acceptability and patient comfort

4. Device Usage Guidelines
   - Proper setup and preparation
   - Safety precautions and contraindications
   - Treatment protocols and dosing considerations
   - Cleaning and maintenance procedures

## Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Device Comparison Exercise (20 minutes)
   - Provide students with specification sheets for various devices
   - Have them compare devices based on key criteria
   - Ask students to recommend devices for specific scenarios (e.g., rural clinic, urban hospital, home use)

2. Hands-on Device Usage (20 minutes)
   - Demonstrate proper setup and use of different devices
   - Allow students to practice using devices on each other under supervision
   - Emphasize safety procedures and proper technique

## Production Task (30 minutes)

Divide the class into small groups and assign each group a specific healthcare setting in Timor-Leste (e.g., rural health post, district hospital, private clinic). Ask each group to:
1. Develop a guide for selecting and maintaining light therapy devices for their assigned setting
2. Create a list of recommended devices and justify their choices
3. Outline usage guidelines and maintenance procedures specific to their setting

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

1. Have each group briefly present their device selection guide
2. Facilitate a class discussion on the challenges and opportunities for implementing light therapy in various Timorese healthcare settings
3. Review key points from the lesson and address any remaining questions

## Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a 1-2 page report on how climate and infrastructure challenges in Timor-Leste might affect light therapy device selection and usage
2. Develop a patient education handout in Tetum explaining how to use a home light therapy device safely and effectively

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- LED (Light Emitting Diode): A semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current passes through it
- Laser: A device that emits a narrow, intense beam of coherent light through a process of optical amplification
- Power density: The output power of a light source divided by the area of the beam, typically measured in mW/cm²
- Irradiance: The power of electromagnetic radiation per unit area incident on a surface, typically measured in W/m²
- Wavelength: The distance between successive crests of a wave, determining the type and color of light
- Treatment area: The size of the body surface that can be effectively covered by a light therapy device
- Pulsed vs. continuous wave: Refers to whether the light is emitted in short bursts (pulsed) or as a constant stream (continuous wave)
