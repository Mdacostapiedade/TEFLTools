# Lesson Plan: Safety Considerations and Contraindications in Light Therapy

## Resources Needed

- Light therapy devices (LED panels and/or laser devices)
- Protective eyewear
- Handouts on photosensitizing medications
- Role-play scenario cards
- Whiteboard and markers
- Laptop and projector for presentations

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify potential risks and side effects of light therapy
2. Recognize contraindications for light therapy treatment
3. Explain safety precautions and protective measures
4. Understand cultural sensitivities related to light therapy in Timor-Leste

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students answer true/false questions about light therapy safety myths
- Class discussion on the results, addressing common misconceptions

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

- Introduce and define key terms:
  * Photosensitivity
  * Contraindication
  * Ocular protection
  * Biphasic dose response
  * Photobiomodulation

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Potential risks and side effects of light therapy
   - Temporary visual disturbances
   - Skin irritation or redness
   - Headaches or dizziness
   - Fatigue from overuse (biphasic dose response)

2. Contraindications for light therapy
   - Recent eye surgery or retinal conditions
   - Active cancer or history of skin cancer
   - Photosensitizing medications
   - Pregnancy (as a precaution due to limited research)

3. Safety precautions and protective measures
   - Proper eye protection
   - Skin preparation and cleanliness
   - Device maintenance and hygiene
   - Proper training for practitioners

4. Cultural sensitivities in Timor-Leste
   - Respecting local beliefs about light and healing
   - Gender considerations in treatment settings
   - Language barriers and informed consent

## Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Group activity: Students categorize various conditions and medications as safe, cautionary, or contraindicated for light therapy.

2. Role-play scenarios: Students practice addressing safety concerns and educating patients about light therapy risks and precautions.

3. Device demonstration: Hands-on practice with proper setup, hygiene protocols, and eye protection for light therapy devices.

## Production Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Develop a safety checklist for light therapy practitioners in Timor-Leste, considering local context and resources.

2. Create patient education materials in Tetum explaining light therapy safety and precautions.

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick recap of key safety points
- Q&A session for any remaining questions or concerns

## Homework Assignment

1. Research and write a short report on a specific photosensitizing medication commonly used in Timor-Leste and its implications for light therapy.

2. Design a poster in Tetum highlighting the main safety precautions for light therapy, suitable for display in a local clinic.

## Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Photosensitivity: Increased sensitivity to light, often due to certain medications or medical conditions
- Contraindication: A condition or factor that serves as a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment due to potential harm
- Ocular protection: Measures taken to protect the eyes during light therapy, such as using specialized goggles
- Biphasic dose response: The phenomenon where a low dose of light therapy stimulates beneficial effects, while a higher dose inhibits these effects
- Photobiomodulation: The use of light to stimulate, heal, and regenerate tissue
