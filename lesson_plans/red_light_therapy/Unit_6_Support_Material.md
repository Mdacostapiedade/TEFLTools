Here's the support material for the lesson plan on "Safety Considerations and Contraindications in Light Therapy," formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Light Therapy Safety Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Photosensitivity**: Increased sensitivity to light, often due to certain medications or medical conditions
- **Contraindication**: A condition or factor that serves as a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment due to potential harm
- **Ocular protection**: Measures taken to protect the eyes during light therapy, such as using specialized goggles
- **Biphasic dose response**: The phenomenon where a low dose of light therapy stimulates beneficial effects, while a higher dose inhibits these effects
- **Photobiomodulation**: The use of light to stimulate, heal, and regenerate tissue
- **LED**: Light-Emitting Diode, a type of light source used in light therapy devices
- **Laser**: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, another type of light source used in some light therapy devices
- **Wavelength**: The distance between successive crests of a wave, determining the color and penetration depth of light
- **Power density**: The amount of power (energy over time) applied to a given area during light therapy treatment

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Light Therapy Safety Checklist Diagram**
   Description: A flowchart illustrating the steps for safe light therapy application, including:
   - Patient screening
   - Device selection
   - Eye protection
   - Skin preparation
   - Treatment application
   - Post-treatment care

2. **Contraindications Infographic**
   Description: A visual representation of common contraindications for light therapy, using icons and brief explanations for:
   - Recent eye surgery
   - Active cancer
   - Photosensitizing medications
   - Pregnancy
   - Epilepsy
   - Certain skin conditions

3. **Biphasic Dose Response Graph**
   Description: A graph showing the relationship between light therapy dose and biological response, illustrating:
   - Stimulation phase at lower doses
   - Optimal dose range
   - Inhibition phase at higher doses

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Light Therapy Safety Quiz**
   Content: A series of true/false and multiple-choice questions covering key safety concepts, including:
   - Contraindications
   - Proper eye protection
   - Device maintenance
   - Recognizing adverse reactions

2. **Patient Screening Checklist**
   Content: A comprehensive list of questions to ask patients before administering light therapy, including:
   - Medical history
   - Current medications
   - Skin sensitivity
   - Previous light therapy experiences

3. **Light Therapy Device Comparison Worksheet**
   Content: A table for students to fill out, comparing different light therapy devices on safety features such as:
   - Automatic shut-off
   - Adjustable power settings
   - Built-in timer
   - Cooling mechanisms

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language barriers**
   - Tip: Prepare key terms and explanations in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids extensively to support understanding.

2. **Limited access to high-tech devices**
   - Tip: Focus on principles that can be applied with various device types. Demonstrate improvised safety measures for basic devices.

3. **Cultural sensitivity around body exposure**
   - Tip: Discuss culturally appropriate ways to administer light therapy while maintaining modesty. Address gender considerations in treatment settings.

4. **Misconceptions about light therapy**
   - Tip: Begin the lesson by addressing common myths. Encourage students to share local beliefs about light and healing for discussion.

5. **Difficulty understanding technical concepts**
   - Tip: Use analogies relevant to Timorese daily life to explain complex ideas. For example, compare biphasic dose response to the effects of sunlight on plants.

6. **Limited prior knowledge of physics or biology**
   - Tip: Provide brief, simplified explanations of fundamental concepts as needed. Focus on practical applications rather than deep theoretical understanding.

7. **Concerns about implementing safety measures with limited resources**
   - Tip: Discuss cost-effective alternatives and improvised safety solutions. Emphasize the importance of basic precautions even with limited equipment.
