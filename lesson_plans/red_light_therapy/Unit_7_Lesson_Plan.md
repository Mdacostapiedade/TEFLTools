# Lesson Plan: Light Penetration and Tissue Interactions

## 1. Resources Needed

- LED light therapy devices (red and near-infrared)
- Tissue models (artificial skin, fat, muscle, and bone samples)
- Light measurement tools (power meter, spectrophotometer)
- Protective eyewear
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on optical properties of tissues
- Laptops or tablets for research

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain how light interacts with different types of body tissues
- Analyze factors affecting light penetration in various body areas
- Evaluate strategies for enhancing light penetration in darker skin types
- Develop guidelines for adjusting treatments based on Timorese skin types

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with a flashlight and various objects (e.g., paper, cloth, plastic)
- Ask students to shine the light through each object and observe how light penetrates or is blocked
- Discuss observations as a class, relating them to how light might interact with different body tissues

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Optical properties
- Absorption
- Scattering
- Reflection
- Melanin
- Penetration depth

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### A. Optical Properties of Tissues
- Explain the basic optical properties of skin, fat, muscle, and bone
- Discuss how these properties affect light penetration

### B. Influence of Melanin Content
- Describe the role of melanin in light absorption
- Explain how different skin types affect light penetration

### C. Strategies for Enhancing Light Penetration
- Present methods for improving light penetration in darker skin types
- Discuss the importance of adjusting treatment parameters based on individual characteristics

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### A. Tissue Model Experiment
- Divide students into groups
- Provide each group with tissue models and light therapy devices
- Have students measure light penetration through different tissue types using power meters
- Ask groups to record and analyze their findings

### B. Case Study Analysis
- Present case studies of patients with different skin types and body compositions
- Have students work in pairs to determine appropriate treatment adjustments for each case

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

### A. Guideline Development
- In small groups, have students develop guidelines for adjusting light therapy treatments based on Timorese skin types
- Ask each group to present their guidelines to the class for feedback and discussion

### B. Treatment Protocol Design
- Individually, have students design a treatment protocol for a specific condition, taking into account tissue interactions and patient characteristics

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Conduct a brief quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
- Review the quiz answers as a class, clarifying any misunderstandings
- Summarize the main points of the lesson and their practical applications in Timor-Leste

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 2-page report on how traditional Timorese healing practices involving light compare to modern light therapy techniques
- Develop a patient education handout explaining light penetration and tissue interactions in simple terms, suitable for use in Timorese healthcare settings

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Optical properties: Characteristics of a material that determine how it interacts with light
- Absorption: The process by which light energy is taken up by matter
- Scattering: The process by which light is forced to deviate from a straight trajectory by irregularities in the medium
- Reflection: The change in direction of a wave at an interface between two different media
- Melanin: A pigment that gives human skin, hair, and eyes their color
- Penetration depth: The depth at which the intensity of light inside tissue falls to 1/e (about 37%) of its original value at the surface
