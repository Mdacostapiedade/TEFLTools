## 5. Additional Materials

### Short Story: "The Healer's Journey"

Maria, a young woman from Dili, had always been fascinated by her grandmother's ability to heal people using traditional methods. One day, she met a visitor from Japan who introduced her to Reiki. Intrigued, Maria began learning Reiki while continuing to observe her grandmother's practices.

As she deepened her understanding of both healing systems, Maria noticed many similarities in the underlying principles of energy and intention. She also saw how Reiki could complement the traditional practices, offering a gentle, non-invasive option for those seeking healing.

Maria's journey led her to become a bridge between the two healing traditions, respecting her cultural heritage while embracing new knowledge. Her story inspired many in her community to explore how ancient wisdom and modern practices could work together for the benefit of all.

### Visualization Exercise: Connecting with Reiki Energy

1. Sit comfortably with your eyes closed.
2. Take three deep breaths, feeling yourself relax with each exhale.
3. Imagine a warm, gentle light surrounding you.
4. Visualize this light as pure, healing energy.
5. As you breathe in, imagine drawing this energy into your body.
6. As you breathe out, imagine this energy spreading throughout your entire being.
7. Feel a sense of peace and balance as you connect with this universal life force.
8. When ready, slowly open your eyes and take a moment to reflect on the experience.

This exercise can be used as an introduction to sensing and working with Reiki energy.
