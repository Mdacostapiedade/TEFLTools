   - Emphasize Reiki as complementary to, not replacing, traditional practices

3. **Skepticism**:
   - Focus on the practical benefits of Reiki principles in daily life
   - Share personal experiences or invite a local Reiki practitioner to speak
   - Encourage an open-minded, experiential approach

4. **Limited Resources**:
   - Prepare simple, printable handouts that can be easily reproduced
   - Encourage group sharing of any available books or materials
   - Use natural objects (stones, plants) for energy sensing exercises

5. **Varying Literacy Levels**:
   - Use oral traditions and storytelling to convey key concepts
   - Incorporate hands-on activities and demonstrations
   - Encourage peer teaching and group discussions
