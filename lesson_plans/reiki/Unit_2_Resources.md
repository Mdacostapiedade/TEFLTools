### The Legend of the Seven Suns
*A Timorese folktale adapted to illustrate the concept of chakras*

Long ago, when the world was young, there were seven suns in the sky. Each sun shone with a different color and brought unique gifts to the earth. The red sun brought warmth and vitality, the orange sun creativity and joy, the yellow sun wisdom and clarity, the green sun love and harmony, the blue sun truth and expression, the indigo sun intuition and insight, and the violet sun spirituality and connection to the divine.

The people of Timor-Leste lived in balance with these seven suns, honoring each one's gifts. They knew that just as the seven suns brought life to the world, seven centers of energy within their own bodies brought life and balance to their being.

One day, a great darkness threatened to extinguish the suns. The people joined together, using the strength of their inner light to protect the seven suns. Though the suns retreated into the sky, becoming distant stars, their energy remained within the people, flowing through the seven centers of their bodies.

From that day forward, the people of Timor-Leste remembered that they carried the power of the seven suns within them, accessible through what we now call the seven chakras.

### Chakra Meditation Script

*To be read slowly, with pauses between each chakra*

Find a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Imagine a warm, glowing light at the base of your spine. This is your root chakra, connecting you to the earth...

(Continue through each chakra, ending with the crown)

...Finally, visualize a brilliant white or violet light at the top of your head, your crown chakra, connecting you to the universe and all that is. Take a moment to feel the energy flowing through all your chakras, from root to crown. When you're ready, slowly open your eyes.
