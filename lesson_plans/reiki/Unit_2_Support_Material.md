## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Cultural Sensitivity:
   - Challenge: Some students may be skeptical about energy concepts that differ from traditional Timorese beliefs.
   - Solution: Draw parallels between chakra system and local concepts of spiritual well-being. Emphasize that this is one perspective among many.

2. Abstract Concepts:
   - Challenge: Energy and chakras are abstract and may be difficult for some students to grasp.
   - Solution: Use plenty of visual aids, physical demonstrations, and hands-on exercises to make the concepts more tangible.

3. Varying Sensitivities:
   - Challenge: Students may have different levels of sensitivity when trying to sense energy.
   - Solution: Emphasize that this is normal and that sensitivity can be developed with practice. Encourage students to trust their experiences, no matter how subtle.

4. Emotional Responses:
   - Challenge: Chakra work can sometimes bring up unexpected emotions.
   - Solution: Create a safe, supportive environment. Have a plan for how to handle emotional reactions, including offering breaks or one-on-one support if needed.

5. Language Barriers:
   - Challenge: Some Reiki terms may not have direct translations in Tetum.
   - Solution: Work with local language experts to find appropriate translations or explanations. Use analogies from Timorese culture to explain concepts.

6. Balancing Theory and Practice:
   - Challenge: Ensuring students get enough hands-on practice while covering necessary theory.
   - Solution: Integrate short practical exercises throughout the theoretical portions of the lesson. Use the "teach-practice-teach" method to break up longer explanations.
