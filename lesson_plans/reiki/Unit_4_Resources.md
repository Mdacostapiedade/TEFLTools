# Resources for Learning Unit 4: Reiki Symbols and Distance Healing

## 1. Excerpts and Short Stories

### The Legend of the Reiki Symbols

Long ago, in ancient Japan, a wise master named Mikao Usui climbed to the top of Mount Kurama to meditate. After 21 days of fasting and deep contemplation, he experienced a profound spiritual awakening. In a burst of light, sacred symbols appeared before him, each pulsing with divine energy. These symbols—Cho Ku Rei, Sei He Ki, and Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen—became the cornerstone of Reiki practice, holding the keys to channeling universal life force energy for healing and transformation.

### A Timorese Tale of Distant Connection

In a small village in the mountains of Timor-Leste, there lived an old healer named Mau Bere. Though he rarely left his home, villagers spoke of his ability to ease pain and cure illness from afar. When asked about his gift, Mau Bere would smile and say, "The wind carries my intentions, and the stars guide my healing touch. Distance is but an illusion when our hearts are connected."

### Cultural Integration Example: Reiki and Timorese Healing Rituals

In some Timorese healing traditions, practitioners use sacred objects or natural elements to channel healing energy. Consider how you might respectfully incorporate local practices into your Reiki work:

- Incorporate local healing plants or herbs in your practice space
- Begin sessions with a traditional Timorese blessing or invocation
- Explore how Reiki symbols might complement Timorese symbolic practices

Remember to always approach cultural integration with respect, seeking guidance from local elders or healers when appropriate.
