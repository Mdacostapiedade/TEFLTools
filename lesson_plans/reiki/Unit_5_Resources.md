# Resources for Learning Unit 5: Integrating Reiki in Daily Life

## 1. Excerpts and Short Stories

### Excerpt from "The Ultimate Guide to Reiki" by K. Niranjan Kumar Reddy (adapted for Timor-Leste context)

```
Chapter 8: Reiki in Everyday Life

Reiki is not just a healing modality to be used in formal sessions, but a way of life that can be integrated into every aspect of your daily routine. In Timor-Leste, where community and connection to the land are deeply valued, Reiki can be a powerful tool for enhancing these cultural strengths.

Consider starting your day with a brief self-Reiki session, focusing on your heart and solar plexus chakras to set a positive intention for the day ahead. As you prepare your morning coffee or tea, infuse it with Reiki energy by holding your hands around the cup for a few moments before drinking.

Throughout the day, use Reiki to bless your meals, calm your mind during stressful moments, or send healing energy to plants and animals in your environment. In the evening, a Reiki self-treatment can help you release the day's tensions and prepare for restful sleep.

Remember, in Timor-Leste's collective culture, your personal Reiki practice can have a ripple effect, positively influencing your family and community. By maintaining your own energy balance, you become better equipped to support others and contribute to the harmony of your surroundings.
