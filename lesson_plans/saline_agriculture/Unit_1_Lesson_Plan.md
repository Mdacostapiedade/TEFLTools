- Handouts on saline agriculture basics
- Whiteboard and markers

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the challenges of soil salinity in Timor-Leste
- Define saline agriculture and its basic principles
- Identify the benefits and potential of saline agriculture
- Conduct basic soil salinity tests

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show pictures of healthy crops and salt-affected crops
- Ask students to identify differences and discuss possible causes

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Soil salinity
- Saline agriculture
- Salt-tolerant crops
- Electrical conductivity (EC)
- Leaching

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

### a. Overview of soil salinity issues in Timor-Leste
- Causes of soil salinity in coastal areas
- Impact on traditional agriculture
- Current extent of the problem

### b. Introduction to saline agriculture concepts
- Definition and principles of saline agriculture
- Comparison with traditional agriculture
- Examples of successful saline agriculture projects

### c. Benefits and potential of saline agriculture
- Food security improvements
- Economic opportunities
- Environmental benefits

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Soil salinity testing
- Demonstrate how to use soil testing kits
- Divide students into groups and provide local soil samples
- Guide students through the testing process
- Have groups record and share their results

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

### Group discussion on current agricultural challenges
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group discusses and lists current agricultural challenges in their community
- Groups present their findings to the class
- Facilitate a discussion on how saline agriculture might address these challenges

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Summarize key points of the lesson
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Quick quiz on main concepts covered

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a one-page report on a salt-tolerant crop that could be suitable for Timor-Leste
- Collect a soil sample from their local area for next class's testing activity

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Soil salinity: The amount of dissolved salts in soil
- Saline agriculture: Farming practices adapted to grow crops in salt-affected soils
- Salt-tolerant crops: Plants that can grow and produce yield in saline conditions
- Electrical conductivity (EC): A measure of soil salinity
- Leaching: The process of washing away soluble salts from soil using water
