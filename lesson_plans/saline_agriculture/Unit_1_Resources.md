## 1. Lecture Notes

### Overview of soil salinity issues in Timor-Leste

#### Causes of soil salinity in Timor-Leste
- Coastal location: Proximity to the sea leads to saltwater intrusion
- Climate: High evaporation rates in dry seasons concentrate salts
- Irrigation practices: Poor water management can increase soil salinity
- Deforestation: Leads to rising water tables, bringing salts to the surface

#### Impact on traditional agriculture
- Reduced crop yields: Most traditional crops are sensitive to salt
- Land abandonment: Farmers leave highly saline areas uncultivated
- Food insecurity: Decreased agricultural production affects food availability
- Economic losses: Reduced farm income and increased poverty

#### Current extent of the problem
- Estimated 30% of coastal agricultural land affected by salinity
- Increasing trend due to climate change and sea-level rise
- Most affected areas: Manatuto, Manufahi, and Cova Lima districts

### Introduction to saline agriculture concepts

#### Definition and principles
- Saline agriculture: Cultivation of crops on salt-affected soils
- Key principle: Adapting to salinity rather than trying to eliminate it
- Focus on salt-tolerant crops and modified farming practices

#### Comparison with traditional agriculture
- Traditional: Avoid saline areas, attempt to "fix" salt problems
- Saline agriculture: Embrace salinity as a given condition
- Different crop choices: Salt-tolerant vs. salt-sensitive species
- Modified irrigation and soil management techniques

#### Examples of successful saline agriculture projects
- Pakistan: Biosaline forestry in the Sindh province
- Egypt: Salt-tolerant forage production in the Nile Delta
- Netherlands: Saline potato cultivation on Texel Island

### Benefits and potential of saline agriculture

#### Food security improvements
- Increased agricultural production in previously unusable land
- Diversification of crop types, enhancing nutritional variety
- Resilience to increasing salinity due to climate change

#### Economic opportunities
- New markets for salt-tolerant crops (e.g., quinoa, salicornia)
- Potential for export of saline agriculture expertise and products
- Reduced reliance on imported food in coastal areas

#### Environmental benefits
- Reduced pressure on freshwater resources
- Prevention of land degradation in saline areas
- Potential for carbon sequestration in saline soils

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How has soil salinity affected agriculture in your local community?
2. What are the main challenges farmers face when dealing with saline soils?
3. How might saline agriculture change traditional farming practices in Timor-Leste?
4. What potential benefits and drawbacks do you see in adopting saline agriculture techniques?
5. How could saline agriculture contribute to food security in Timor-Leste?
6. What cultural or social barriers might exist to implementing saline agriculture?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Imagine you are a farmer in a coastal area of Timor-Leste affected by soil salinity. Describe the challenges you face and how adopting saline agriculture techniques could change your farming practices and livelihood."

Include in your essay:
- Specific challenges related to soil salinity
- At least two saline agriculture techniques you could adopt
- Potential benefits and risks of changing your farming practices
- How these changes might affect your community

## 4. Assignment Details

### Soil Salinity Testing Project

#### Objectives:
- Gain hands-on experience with soil salinity testing
- Analyze and interpret soil salinity data
- Understand the variability of soil salinity in local areas

#### Instructions:
1. Collect 3-5 soil samples from different locations in your local area
2. Use the provided soil testing kit to measure the electrical conductivity (EC) of each sample
3. Record the EC values and GPS coordinates (if possible) for each sample
4. Create a simple map showing the locations and EC values of your samples
5. Write a 1-page report analyzing your findings, including:
   - Description of sampling locations
   - EC values and their interpretation (low, medium, high salinity)
   - Possible reasons for variations in salinity between samples
   - Potential implications for agriculture in the sampled areas

## 5. Additional Materials

### Case Study: Saline Agriculture in Bangladesh

Bangladesh, like Timor-Leste, faces significant challenges with soil salinity in coastal areas. This case study examines the implementation of saline agriculture techniques in the country's southwest region.

#### Background:
- Over 1 million hectares affected by soil salinity
- Salinity intrusion exacerbated by shrimp farming and sea-level rise
- Traditional rice cultivation became increasingly difficult

#### Saline Agriculture Interventions:
1. Introduction of salt-tolerant rice varieties (e.g., BRRI Dhan 47, BRRI Dhan 61)
2. Promotion of salt-tolerant vegetables (e.g., tomato, chili, eggplant)
3. Implementation of raised bed farming to reduce salt accumulation
4. Use of mulching to reduce evaporation and salt concentration

#### Results:
- Increased crop yields in saline areas by 20-30%
- Diversification of agricultural production
- Improved farmer incomes and food security
- Greater resilience to increasing salinity levels

#### Lessons for Timor-Leste:
- Importance of locally adapted salt-tolerant crop varieties
- Need for integrated approach combining crop selection and soil management
- Potential for rapid adoption when benefits are demonstrated
- Crucial role of farmer training and extension services
