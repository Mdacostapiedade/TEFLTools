Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 2: Salt-Tolerant Crops for Timor-Leste, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Salt-Tolerant Crops for Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Samples of salt-tolerant crop seeds (quinoa, barley, date palm, etc.)
- Pictures or posters of salt-tolerant crops
- Handouts with crop information
- Soil samples from Timor-Leste (both saline and non-saline)
- Crop rotation planning worksheets
- Projector and computer for presentations

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify at least five salt-tolerant crops suitable for Timor-Leste
- Describe the key characteristics and requirements of these crops
- Explain how these crops can be adapted to Timor-Leste's climate
- Discuss the nutritional and economic value of salt-tolerant crops
- Create a basic crop rotation plan using salt-tolerant crops

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display various crop seeds and pictures
- Ask students to guess which crops they think might be salt-tolerant
- Discuss their reasoning and prior knowledge about salt-tolerant plants

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Salt tolerance
- Halophyte
- Adaptation
- Crop rotation
- Salinity threshold
- Biomass
- Yield potential

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Overview of Salt-Tolerant Crops
- Define salt-tolerant crops and their importance
- Present a list of salt-tolerant crops suitable for Timor-Leste:
  * Quinoa
  * Barley
  * Date palms
  * Saltbush
  * Sea asparagus (Salicornia)
  * Salt-tolerant rice varieties

### Adaptation to Timor-Leste's Climate
- Discuss Timor-Leste's climate characteristics
- Explain how each crop can be adapted to local conditions
- Present case studies of successful adaptations in similar climates

### Nutritional and Economic Value
- Discuss the nutritional benefits of each crop
- Present data on potential economic returns
- Explain market opportunities for salt-tolerant crops

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Seed Identification Exercise
- Divide students into groups
- Provide each group with a set of unlabeled seed samples
- Have students identify the seeds and match them to crop descriptions

### Crop Characteristics Matching Game
- Create cards with crop names and characteristics
- Have students match the crops to their correct characteristics

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

### Planning a Diverse Salt-Tolerant Crop Rotation
- Introduce the principles of crop rotation
- Provide students with crop rotation planning worksheets
- Have students create a 3-year crop rotation plan using salt-tolerant crops
- Ask students to present and explain their plans to the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Conduct a quick quiz on the main points covered
- Address any questions or misconceptions
- Summarize the key takeaways from the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research one salt-tolerant crop not covered in class
- Write a one-page report on its potential benefits and challenges for Timor-Leste
- Design a simple experiment to test the crop's salt tolerance

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Salt tolerance: The ability of a plant to grow and complete its life cycle in saline conditions
- Halophyte: A plant that thrives in high-salt environments
- Adaptation: The process by which a plant becomes better suited to its environment
- Crop rotation: The practice of growing different crops in the same area across seasons
- Salinity threshold: The maximum level of soil salinity a crop can tolerate without significant yield reduction
- Biomass: The total mass of organic matter produced by a plant
- Yield potential: The maximum crop yield possible under ideal growing conditions
