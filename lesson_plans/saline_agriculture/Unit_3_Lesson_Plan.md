Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 3: Soil Management for Saline Agriculture, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Soil Management for Saline Agriculture

## 1. Resources Needed

- Soil samples (saline and non-saline)
- Soil testing kits
- Various organic matter samples (compost, manure, straw)
- Materials for raised bed demonstration (wood planks, soil, tools)
- Handouts on soil leaching techniques and raised bed farming
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Whiteboard and markers

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain at least three techniques for managing saline soils
- Demonstrate the process of soil amendment using organic matter
- Design a basic drainage system for a saline field
- Understand the principles of raised bed farming in saline conditions

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with two soil samples (one saline, one non-saline)
- Ask students to observe and list differences between the samples
- Discuss findings as a class, introducing the challenge of saline soils

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Soil leaching
- Soil amendment
- Organic matter
- Mulching
- Raised bed farming
- Drainage system

Use visual aids and simple definitions to ensure understanding.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### a. Soil Leaching Techniques
- Explain the process of soil leaching
- Discuss various leaching methods (e.g., flood leaching, sprinkler leaching)
- Present case studies of successful soil leaching in similar environments

### b. Use of Organic Matter and Mulching
- Explain the benefits of organic matter in saline soils
- Demonstrate how to incorporate organic matter into soil
- Discuss different types of mulch and their applications

### c. Raised Bed Farming in Saline Conditions
- Introduce the concept of raised bed farming
- Explain its benefits for managing saline soils
- Show examples of successful raised bed farms in saline areas

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

### a. Soil Amendment Exercise (30 minutes)
- Divide class into groups
- Provide each group with saline soil samples and various organic materials
- Guide students through the process of amending soil with organic matter
- Have groups test soil salinity before and after amendment

### b. Drainage System Design (30 minutes)
- Introduce basic principles of drainage system design
- Provide groups with a hypothetical saline field scenario
- Have groups sketch a drainage system design for their scenario
- Groups present their designs to the class for feedback

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

- Students work in pairs to create a mini raised bed using provided materials
- Each pair plans and implements a small-scale soil management strategy for their raised bed
- Encourage creativity in combining different techniques learned

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Facilitate a Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Have students share one new technique they learned and how they plan to apply it

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 1-page report on a successful saline agriculture project that uses soil management techniques discussed in class
- Design a soil management plan for a hypothetical 1-hectare saline field in Timor-Leste

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Soil leaching: The process of removing excess salts from soil by applying water to flush them out
- Soil amendment: The addition of materials to soil to improve its physical or chemical properties
- Organic matter: Decomposed plant or animal material used to improve soil structure and fertility
- Mulching: Covering the soil surface with organic materials to conserve moisture and suppress weeds
- Raised bed farming: A method of growing crops on raised platforms of soil, often used in poorly drained or saline areas
- Drainage system: A network of channels or pipes designed to remove excess water from soil
