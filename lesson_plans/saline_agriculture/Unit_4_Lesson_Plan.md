Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 4: Irrigation Management in Saline Agriculture, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Irrigation Management in Saline Agriculture

## 1. Resources Needed

- Drip irrigation system components (tubing, emitters, filters, etc.)
- Water quality testing kits
- Calculators
- Handouts on irrigation scheduling and crop water requirements
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Soil samples of varying salinity levels

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the principles of drip irrigation in saline conditions
- Identify key components of a drip irrigation system
- Understand the importance of water quality management in saline agriculture
- Calculate basic crop water requirements
- Develop an irrigation schedule that minimizes salt accumulation

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with different soil samples and ask them to hypothesize how irrigation might affect salt levels in each sample
- Discuss findings as a class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Drip irrigation
- Emitters
- Leaching fraction
- Evapotranspiration
- Salinity threshold

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

1. Introduction to drip irrigation systems
   - Components and setup
   - Benefits for saline agriculture

2. Water quality management
   - Importance of water testing
   - Strategies for managing poor quality water

3. Irrigation scheduling for saline conditions
   - Factors affecting irrigation timing
   - Techniques to minimize salt accumulation

4. Calculating crop water requirements
   - Basic formula and considerations
   - Adjustments for saline conditions

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Drip Irrigation System Assembly
   - In small groups, students assemble a small-scale drip irrigation system

2. Water Quality Testing
   - Students test water samples and interpret results

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

1. Irrigation Schedule Development
   - Students create an irrigation schedule for a hypothetical saline field, considering crop type, climate, and soil conditions

2. Crop Water Requirement Calculations
   - Students calculate water requirements for common salt-tolerant crops in Timor-Leste

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion on key takeaways
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Brief recap of main points covered in the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Design a small-scale drip irrigation system for a home garden, including a parts list and basic layout
- Research and write a short report on innovative irrigation techniques used in other saline agriculture regions worldwide

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Drip irrigation: A method of irrigation that saves water and fertilizer by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants
- Emitters: Devices that release water from the irrigation tubing to the soil
- Leaching fraction: The portion of irrigation water that drains below the root zone, carrying salts with it
- Evapotranspiration: The process by which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and transpiration from plants
- Salinity threshold: The maximum soil salinity level that a crop can tolerate without yield reduction
