## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may have limited experience with project planning
   - Tip: Start with simple, relatable examples and gradually increase complexity. Use local case studies to make concepts more concrete.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in understanding the importance of community engagement
   - Tip: Use role-play activities to simulate real-world scenarios and demonstrate the impact of effective or ineffective community engagement.

3. Challenge: Students may struggle with the technical aspects of saline agriculture
   - Tip: Review key concepts from previous units and provide additional resources or one-on-one support as needed.

4. Challenge: Limited access to real-world project examples in Timor-Leste
   - Tip: Collaborate with local NGOs or government agencies to arrange guest speakers or field visits to ongoing projects.

5. Challenge: Varying levels of English proficiency among students
   - Tip: Provide key terms and definitions in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and hands-on activities to reinforce concepts.

6. Challenge: Students may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of project planning
