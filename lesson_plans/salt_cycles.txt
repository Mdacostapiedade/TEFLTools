Here is the full lesson plan with the Extension Activity removed and the homework assignment modified to incorporate researching other natural cycles:

Lesson Objectives:
- Students will learn vocabulary related to chemistry, cycles, and environmental issues
- Students will practice listening comprehension skills
- Students will discuss and analyze the human impact on natural cycles  

Warm-up (10 mins):
- Write the word "cycle" on the board and ask students what cycles in nature they are familiar with (water cycle, carbon cycle, etc.)
- Discuss the meaning of "cycle" and have students give examples

Pre-Viewing (10 mins):
- Introduce key vocabulary from the transcript: ion, compound, erode, fertilizer, detergent, runoff
- Have students discuss what they know about salts and their uses

Viewing Activity (15 mins):
- Play the video with English subtitles/transcript provided
- As they watch, students identify the key points about the salt cycle  

Post-Viewing (20 mins):
- Comprehension questions to check understanding (e.g. What are the main salt ions? How do humans impact the cycle?)
- Discuss the reasons why the disrupted salt cycle is a concern (soil, water, health impacts)
- Have students analyze the pros and cons of human salt use (e.g. road salt, fertilizers)

Wrap-up (10 mins):
- Review key vocabulary and concepts from the lesson
- Assign homework: Research another natural cycle impacted by human activities. Summarize the cycle, how humans disrupt it, and potential consequences.

Vocabulary:
- Ion - An atom or molecule with a positive or negative electrical charge
- Compound - A substance formed by combining two or more elements chemically
- Erode - To gradually wear away or be displaced by wind, water, or other forces  
- Fertilizer - Material added to soil to increase its fertility and promote plant growth
- Detergent - A cleansing agent, especially one used for household or industrial cleaning
- Runoff - The draining away of water from the surface of an area
- Cycle (noun) - A series of events that are regularly repeated in the same order
- Neutral (adj) - Having neither a positive nor negative charge
- Dissolve (verb) - To become incorporated into a liquid so as to form a solution
- Atmosphere (noun) - The gases surrounding the Earth or another planet
- Deicing (noun) - The removal of ice, as from aircraft, roads, and sidewalks
- Zooplankton (noun) - The small floating or weakly swimming animal life of a body of water
- Algal bloom (noun) - A rapid increase in the population of algae in an aquatic system
- Aquifer (noun) - An underground layer of permeable rock that yields groundwater  
- Leach (verb) - To remove soluble or dispersible substances by percolation
