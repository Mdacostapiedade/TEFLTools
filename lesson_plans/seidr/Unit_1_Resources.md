# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "Nine Worlds of Seid-Magic" by Jenny Blain

"Seidr, in the Norse context, appears as a form of magic, associated with both the god Óðinn (Odin) and the goddess Freyja. It is described in the Eddas and sagas as including divination, journeying in spirit form, and manipulating the minds or luck of others. The practitioner, or seiðkona (seidwoman), would typically enter a trance state to perform these workings.

In the Ynglinga saga, Snorri Sturluson tells us that Freyja first brought seidr to the Æsir. It was considered a feminine practice, and when Odin learned and practiced it, he was accused of ergi or unmanliness. This gendered aspect of seidr practice provides insight into Norse cultural norms and the power dynamics associated with magical practices.

Modern practitioners of seidr often focus on its divinatory aspects, particularly the practice of spá, or prophesy. They may use drums, chants, or other tools to enter altered states of consciousness, seeking wisdom from the gods, ancestors, or other spirits of the Norse cosmology."
