# Learning Unit 2: Historical Context and Sources

## 1. Full Text Excerpts

### Excerpt from Völuspá (The Prophecy of the Seeress)

```
I remember giants born early in time,
who long ago had reared me.
Nine worlds I remember, nine wood-ogresses,
glorious tree of good measure, under the ground.

There was an age when Ymir lived.
There was no sand nor sea nor cool waves;
Earth was nowhere nor the sky above,
void of yawning, and grass was there nowhere.

The sons of Bur then built up the lands.
Moulded in magnificence middle-earth was;
The sun from the south, warmed the stones of earth,
And green was the ground with growing leeks.

The sun, sister of moon, from the south her right hand
cast over heaven's rim; No knowledge she had where her home should be,
The moon knew not what might was his,
The stars knew not where their stations were.
```

### Excerpt from Ynglinga saga

```
Odin had the skill which gives great power and which he practiced himself. It is called seid, and by means of it he could know the fate of men and predict events that had not yet come to pass; and by it he could also inflict death or misfortunes or sickness, or also deprive people of their wits or strength, and give them to others. But this sorcery is attended by such ergi [unmanliness] that men considered it shameful to practice it, and so it was taught to priestesses.

Freyja was the first to introduce seid to the Æsir, as it was practiced among the Vanir. While Freyja lived, she was a priestess who made sacrifices, and she was the first to teach seid to the Æsir, as it was practiced among the Vanir.
```

## 2. Lecture Notes

### Icelandic sagas and Eddic poetry as sources

- Icelandic sagas: Prose narratives about Norse history, families, and heroes
  - Written in 13th-14th centuries, but describe earlier events
  - Contain references to seidr practices and practitioners
  - Examples: Saga of Erik the Red, Ynglinga saga

- Eddic poetry: Collection of Old Norse poems
  - Poetic Edda: Anonymous collection of mythological and heroic poems
  - Prose Edda: Written by Snorri Sturluson, includes myths and poetic techniques
  - Völuspá (Prophecy of the Seeress): Key source for Norse cosmology and seidr

- Limitations of these sources:
  - Written centuries after the Viking Age
  - Influenced by Christian scribes and changing cultural contexts
  - May romanticize or demonize pre-Christian practices

### Social and religious landscape of Viking Age Scandinavia

- Time period: Approximately 793-1066 CE
- Geographic area: Scandinavia, British Isles, parts of continental Europe

- Social structure:
  - Chieftain-based society
  - Importance of kinship and honor
  - Slave-holding culture

- Religious beliefs:
  - Polytheistic pantheon (Æsir and Vanir gods)
  - Animistic elements (land spirits, ancestors)
  - Concept of wyrd (fate) and orlog (primal law)

- Interaction with other cultures:
  - Trade networks across Europe and beyond
  - Gradual Christianization process

### Gender roles and seidr practice

- Seidr primarily associated with women (völur)
  - Male practitioners often stigmatized (concept of ergi)
  - Exception: Odin as a male practitioner

- Roles of völur (seeresses):
  - Divination and prophecy
  - Healing and curse-breaking
  - Influencing weather and fertility

- Social status of seidr practitioners:
  - Often respected but also feared
  - Could be outcasts or itinerant workers
  - Some evidence of seidr practitioners at royal courts

- Gender fluidity in Norse mythology:
  - Shape-shifting gods (e.g., Loki)
  - Odin's practice of seidr challenging gender norms

## 3. Discussion Questions

1. How reliable do you think the Icelandic sagas and Eddic poetry are as sources for understanding seidr practices? What factors might influence their accuracy?

2. In what ways might the social structure of Viking Age Scandinavia have influenced the development and practice of seidr?

3. Why do you think seidr was primarily associated with women in Norse society? How does this compare to gender roles in other shamanic traditions you're familiar with?

4. How might the gradual Christianization of Scandinavia have affected the recording and preservation of information about seidr practices?

5. What parallels, if any, do you see between the role of völur in Norse society and spiritual practitioners in Timorese culture?

6. How do you think the concept of fate (wyrd) in Norse culture might have influenced the practice and perception of seidr?

7. In what ways might the association of seidr with "unmanliness" (ergi) reflect broader societal attitudes in Viking Age Scandinavia?

## 4. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay comparing the role of gender in seidr practice to gender roles in Timorese spiritual traditions. Consider the following points:

- The association of seidr with women in Norse culture
- The stigma attached to male seidr practitioners
- The roles of men and women in Timorese spiritual practices
- How these gender associations might reflect broader societal attitudes
- Any similarities or differences you observe between the two traditions

Use specific examples from the course materials and your knowledge of Timorese culture to support your points. Conclude with your thoughts on how understanding these historical gender roles might inform our view of gender and spirituality today.

## 5. Assignment Details

### Create a Timeline of Key Events and Sources Related to Seidr

1. Research and identify at least 10 significant events, texts, or figures related to the history and sources of seidr practice.

   - Date or approximate time period
   - Brief description of the event, text, or figure
   - Its significance to the understanding or practice of seidr

4. Use a combination of text and images in your timeline.

5. Include at least three entries from primary sources (e.g., saga excerpts, archaeological findings) and three from secondary sources (e.g., academic studies, modern interpretations).

6. Conclude your timeline with a brief (200-word) reflection on how the understanding and practice of seidr has evolved over time.
