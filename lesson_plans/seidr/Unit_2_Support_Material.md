## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

   **Solution**: Emphasize the academic, historical approach and encourage respectful discussion of different belief systems.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with unfamiliar Norse names and terms.
   **Solution**: Provide a pronunciation guide and encourage regular use of the vocabulary list.

4. **Challenge**: Connecting ancient practices to modern relevance.
   **Solution**: Facilitate discussions on how understanding historical practices can inform our view of cultural diversity and spiritual expression today.

5. **Challenge**: Balancing historical accuracy with sensitivity to modern pagan practitioners.
   **Solution**: Clearly distinguish between historical practices and modern interpretations, and invite students to critically examine both.

6. **Challenge**: Students may be tempted to appropriate or practice seidr techniques.
