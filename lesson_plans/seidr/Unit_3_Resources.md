## 1. Text Excerpts

### Oracular Seidr from the Saga of Erik the Red

"There was a woman in the settlement who was called Thorbjorg; she was a prophetess and was known as the Little Volva. She had had nine sisters, all of them prophetesses, but she was the only one left alive. It was her custom in winter to attend feasts; she was always invited, in particular, by those who were most curious about their own fortunes or the season's prospects. Since Thorkel was the chief farmer in the district, it was thought to be his responsibility to find out when the current hardships would come to an end. Thorkel invited the prophetess to his house and prepared a good reception for her, as was the custom when such women were being received. A high seat was made ready for her with a cushion on it, which had to be stuffed with hen's feathers.

When she arrived one evening, with the man who had been sent to escort her, she was wearing a black mantle with a strap, which was adorned with precious stones right down to the hem. About her neck she wore a string of glass beads and on her head a hood of black lambskin lined with white catskin. She bore a staff with a knob on it, adorned with brass and set with stones on the knob. About her waist she had a linked charm belt with a large purse. In it she kept charms which she needed for her predictions. She wore calfskin boots lined with fur, with long, sturdy laces and large pewter knobs on the ends. On her hands she wore gloves of catskin, white and furry inside.

When she entered, everyone was supposed to offer her respectful greetings, and she received these according to how she felt about each person. Thorkel took the wise woman by the hand and led her to the seat which had been prepared for her. He asked her to cast her eyes over his household and herds and home. She had little to say about anything.

In the evening the tables were set up, and this is what the prophetess had for her meal: she was given a porridge of kid's milk and a main course of hearts from the various kinds of animals which were available there. She used a brass spoon and a knife with a walrus-tusk handle bound with two rings of copper, with a broken point.

When the tables had been removed, Thorkel the farmer went over to Thorbjorg and asked her how she liked his home and household ways and when she would know the answer to what he had asked and which everyone wanted to learn. She replied that she would not give any answer until the following morning, when she had slept there overnight first.

The next day, towards evening, she was supplied with the preparations she required to perform seidr. She asked for the assistance of women who knew the spells needed for performing seidr, known as Warlock-songs; but there were no such women available. A search was made throughout the farm to see if anyone knew these spells.

Then Gudrid said, 'I am neither a sorceress nor a witch, but when I was in Iceland my foster-mother Halldis taught me spells which she called Warlock-songs.'

Thorbjorg replied, 'Then your knowledge is timely.'

'This is the sort of knowledge and ceremony that I want nothing to do with,' said Gudrid, 'for I am a Christian.'

Thorbjorg answered, 'It may be that you could help people here without in any way harming your faith. But I shall leave it to Thorkel to provide whatever is needed.'

Thorkel now brought pressure on Gudrid, and she consented to do what he wished. The women formed a circle around the ritual platform on which Thorbjorg seated herself. Gudrid sang the songs so beautifully and well that those present were sure they had never heard lovelier songs sung. The prophetess thanked her for the song.

'Many spirits are now present,' she said, 'which were charmed to hear the song and which previously had tried to shun us and would grant us no obedience. And now many things stand revealed to me which before were hidden from me as from others. I can now say that this famine will not last much longer and that conditions will improve as spring approaches. The epidemic which has persisted for so long will also abate sooner than expected.'"

## 5. Assignment Details

### Group Exercise: Creating and Performing a Non-Culturally Appropriative Chant

Objective: To explore the use of chanting in spiritual practices while being mindful of cultural appropriation issues.

Instructions:

1. Form groups of 3-4 students.

2. Research the structure and purpose of chants in various spiritual traditions, including but not limited to Norse seidr. Take notes on common elements and techniques.

3. As a group, create an original chant that:
   - Reflects a theme or intention relevant to your local context or shared experiences
   - Uses a rhythm or structure inspired by your research, but not directly copying any specific tradition
   - Incorporates words or phrases in a language shared by group members
   - Is at least 4 lines long and can be repeated

4. Write a brief explanation (200-300 words) of your chant, including:
   - The intention or purpose behind the chant
   - How you structured the chant and why
   - How you ensured the chant was not culturally appropriative

5. Practice performing your chant as a group, focusing on rhythm, harmony, and creating a sense of group cohesion.

6. Present your chant to the class, first explaining its purpose and structure, then performing it. The performance should last 2-3 minutes.

7. After all groups have presented, participate in a class discussion about the experience of creating and performing the chants, and how this relates to our understanding of seidr practices.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Originality and creativity of the chant
- Thoughtfulness in addressing cultural appropriation concerns
- Quality of the written explanation
- Group coordination and effectiveness of the performance
- Participation in class discussion

Due Date: To be presented in class next week. Written explanations to be submitted at the beginning of the class.

## 6. Additional Materials

### Visualization Exercise: Journey to Yggdrasil

This guided visualization is designed to help students experience a form of spirit journey similar to those described in Norse traditions, while avoiding cultural appropriation.

Instructions for the facilitator:

1. Have students find a comfortable seated position and close their eyes.

2. Guide them through a progressive relaxation, starting from the feet and moving up to the head.

3. Once relaxed, begin the visualization:

"Imagine yourself standing in a misty forest. The air is cool and damp, and you can hear the rustling of leaves in a gentle breeze. As the mist begins to clear, you see before you an enormous tree, its trunk wider than any you've ever seen, its branches reaching up beyond your sight into the sky.

This is Yggdrasil, the World Tree of Norse cosmology. Feel its ancient presence, the energy pulsing through its roots and branches.

As you approach the tree, you notice a shimmering doorway in its trunk. This is your gateway to the Nine Worlds. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, step through the doorway.

You find yourself floating in a vast, star-filled space. Around you, you can see the branches and roots of Yggdrasil stretching out in all directions. Each branch and root leads to one of the Nine Worlds.

Choose one of these paths that calls to you. It might glow, or you might just feel drawn to it. Allow yourself to float along this path.

As you travel, notice what you see, hear, and feel. What colors surround you? Are there any beings or creatures you encounter? What messages or insights come to you?

[Allow 2-3 minutes of silence for personal exploration]

Now, it's time to return. Follow the path back to the central part of Yggdrasil. Float back through the doorway in the trunk, and find yourself once again standing in the misty forest.

Take a few deep breaths, feeling yourself back in your physical body. When you're ready, slowly open your eyes."

4. After the visualization, have students journal about their experience for 10-15 minutes.

5. Facilitate a group discussion about the experience, emphasizing that this was a creative visualization inspired by Norse concepts, not a claim to authentic seidr practice.
