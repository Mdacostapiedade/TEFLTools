## 5. Tips for Teachers

### Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Cultural sensitivity**: 
   - Emphasize respect for both Norse and Timorese traditions
   - Encourage critical thinking about cultural appropriation
   - Frame the lesson as comparative study rather than practice

2. **Misconceptions about Norse practices**:
   - Address popular media portrayals vs. historical evidence
   - Provide reliable academic sources for information

3. **Altered states of consciousness**:
   - Discuss from an academic perspective only
   - Avoid any practical demonstrations in class

4. **Religious concerns**:
   - Clarify that the course is academic, not religious instruction
   - Allow students to opt-out of activities they find uncomfortable

5. **Language barriers**:
   - Provide clear definitions and explanations of Norse terms
   - Use visual aids to support understanding

6. **Lack of prior knowledge**:

7. **Ethical debates**:
   - Facilitate respectful discussions
   - Provide framework for constructive dialogue on sensitive topics
