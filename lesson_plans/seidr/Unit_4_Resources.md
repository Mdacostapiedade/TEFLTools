## 1. Text Excerpts

### The Nine Worlds and Yggdrasil

From the Poetic Edda, Völuspá (The Prophecy of the Seeress):

```
I remember giants
born early in time,
who long ago
had reared me.
Nine worlds I remember,
nine wood-ogresses,
glorious tree of good measure,
under the ground.

There stands an ash
called Yggdrasil,
a mighty tree showered
in white hail.
From there come the dews
that fall in the valleys.
It stands evergreen above
Urd's Well.
```

### Gods, Ancestors, and Nature Spirits

From the Prose Edda, Gylfaginning:

```
Then said Gangleri: "Where is the chief center or holy place of the gods?" High replied: "It is at the ash Yggdrasil. There the gods must hold their courts each day." Then said Gangleri: "What is there to tell about that place?" Then said Just-as-high: "The ash is the biggest and best of all trees. Its branches spread out over all the world and extend across the sky. Three roots of the tree hold it up and extend very, very far. One is among the Æsir, the second among the frost-giants, where Ginnungagap once was. The third extends over Niflheim, and under that root is Hvergelmir, and Nidhogg gnaws the bottom of the root."
```

## 3. Discussion Questions

1. How does the concept of Nine Worlds in Norse cosmology compare to other cosmological systems you're familiar with?

2. In what ways might the structure of Yggdrasil reflect Norse cultural values or their understanding of the natural world?

3. How do the roles and attributes of Norse gods compare to deities in Timorese traditional beliefs?

4. What similarities and differences do you see between the Norse concept of landvaettir and Timorese beliefs about nature spirits?

5. How might the Norse emphasis on ancestral veneration compare to ancestor-related practices in Timorese culture?

6. In what ways could the Norse cosmological structure influence seidr practices?
