## Saga of Erik the Red - Seidr Ritual Description

"There was a woman in the settlement who was called Thorbjorg; she was a prophetess, and was known as the Little Völva. She had had nine sisters, all of whom were prophetesses, but she alone remained alive. It was Thorbjorg's custom in winter to attend feasts; she was especially invited by those who were curious about their fate or the season's prospects. As Thorkel was the chief farmer in the district, it was thought to be his responsibility to find out when the current hardships would come to an end. Thorkel invited the prophetess to his home and prepared a good reception for her, as was the custom when such women were received. A high seat was prepared for her with a cushion on it, which had to be stuffed with hen feathers.

When she arrived in the evening with the man who had been sent to escort her, she was dressed like this: she wore a blue cloak fastened with straps and adorned with stones all the way down to the hem. She had glass beads around her neck and on her head a black lambskin hood lined with white cat's fur. In her hand she carried a staff with a brass-bound knob studded with stones. She wore a belt of touchwood, from which hung a large pouch, where she kept the charms she needed for her magic. On her feet were hairy calfskin shoes with long, sturdy laces that had large tin buttons on the ends. She wore catskin gloves, with the fur on the inside.

When she entered, everyone felt obliged to offer her respectful greetings, to which she responded according to how she felt about each person. Thorkel took her by the hand and led her to the seat that had been prepared for her. He asked her to cast her eyes over his household, his herds, and his home. She had little to say about anything.

In the evening, tables were set up, and this is what the prophetess had for her meal: she was given a porridge made from goat's milk, and a main course of hearts from all kinds of animals that were available there. She used a brass spoon and a knife with a walrus-tusk handle bound with two rings of copper; the blade had a broken point.

When the tables had been removed, Thorkel went over to Thorbjorg and asked her how she liked his home and household, and how soon she would know the answer to what he had asked and people wanted to know. She replied that she would not give any answer before the morning, after she had slept there for the night. Late the next day, she was supplied with the preparations she required to perform seidr. She asked for the assistance of women who knew the chants necessary for performing seidr, which are known as Warlock-songs. But no such women were to be found. A search was made throughout the farm to see if anyone knew these songs.

Then Gudrid said, 'I am neither a sorceress nor a prophetess, but when I was in Iceland, my foster-mother Halldis taught me a chant that she called Warlock-song.'

Thorbjorg replied, 'Then your knowledge is timely.'

'This is the sort of knowledge and ceremony that I want nothing to do with,' said Gudrid, 'for I am a Christian.'

Thorbjorg said, 'It may be that you could help people here without compromising your faith. I leave it to Thorkel to provide what is needed.'

Thorkel now urged Gudrid to consent, and she agreed to do as he wished. The women formed a circle around the platform on which Thorbjorg seated herself. Gudrid sang the song so beautifully and well that no one present had heard the chant sung with fairer voice. The prophetess thanked her for the song and said, 'Many spirits have been attracted here by the lovely chanting, spirits who had previously sought to shun us and would grant us no obedience. And now many things stand revealed to me that before were hidden from me as from others.'"
