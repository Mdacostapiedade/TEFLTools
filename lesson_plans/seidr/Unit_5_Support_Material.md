## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may have misconceptions about shamanic practices.
   - Tip: Begin with a clear definition of shamanism and its variations across cultures. Emphasize the academic approach to studying these practices.

2. Challenge: Discussions about cultural appropriation may become heated.
   - Tip: Establish ground rules for respectful discussion. Encourage students to back up their opinions with evidence and to listen actively to others' perspectives.

3. Challenge: Students may be skeptical about the validity of reviving ancient practices.
   - Tip: Frame the discussion in terms of cultural evolution and adaptation. Discuss how other ancient practices (e.g., yoga, meditation) have been adapted for modern use.

4. Challenge: Some students may want to try seidr techniques themselves.
   - Tip: Clearly state that the course is academic in nature and not intended to train practitioners. Provide resources on ethical considerations for those interested in further exploration.

5. Challenge: Balancing respect for local Timorese traditions with the study of Northern European practices.
   - Tip: Regularly draw comparisons and contrasts with local traditions. Invite guest speakers from the local community to discuss Timorese spiritual practices.
