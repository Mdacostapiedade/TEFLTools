# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Saga of Erik the Red - Seidr Ritual Description

There was a woman in the settlement who was called Thorbjorg; she was a prophetess, and was known as the Little Völva. She had had nine sisters, all of whom were prophetesses, but she was the only one left alive. It was Thorbjorg's custom in winter to attend feasts; she was always invited, in particular, by those who were most curious about their own fortunes or the season's prospects. Since Thorkel of Herjolfsness was the chief farmer in the district, it was thought to be his responsibility to find out when the current hardships would come to an end. Thorkel invited the prophetess to his house and prepared a good reception for her, as was the custom when such women were being received. A high seat was made ready for her with a cushion on it, which had to be stuffed with hen's feathers.

When she arrived one evening, with the man who had been sent to escort her, she was wearing a black mantle with a strap, which was adorned with precious stones right down to the hem. About her neck she wore a string of glass beads and on her head a hood of black lambskin lined with white catskin. She bore a staff with a knob on it, adorned with brass and set with stones on the knob. About her waist she had a linked charm belt with a large purse. In it she kept charms which she needed for her predictions. She wore calfskin boots lined with fur, with long, sturdy laces and large pewter knobs on the ends. On her hands she wore gloves of catskin, white and furry inside.

When she entered, everyone was supposed to offer her respectful greetings, and she received these according to how she liked each person. Farmer Thorkel took the wise woman by the hand and led her to the seat which had been prepared for her. Thorkel asked her to cast her eyes over his household and herds and home. She had little to say about anything.

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflection on Cross-Cultural Spiritual Exploration

Write a 500-word reflection paper on the ethics of studying and potentially practicing techniques from other cultures. Consider the following points:

1. Respect for indigenous traditions: How can we study these practices while maintaining respect for their original cultural context?
2. Cultural appropriation: What is the difference between appreciation and appropriation when it comes to spiritual practices?
3. Potential benefits of cross-cultural spiritual exploration: How might learning about diverse spiritual practices enrich our understanding of human spirituality?
4. Potential risks of cross-cultural spiritual exploration: What are the dangers of misunderstanding or misusing practices from other cultures?
5. Your personal perspective: How do you navigate the balance between curiosity about other traditions and respect for cultural boundaries?

Use specific examples from the seidr practices we've discussed in class, and if possible, draw comparisons with Timorese spiritual traditions.
