## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

   Tip: Emphasize connections to contemporary issues and encourage students to draw parallels with their own cultural experiences.

   Tip: Stress the importance of respect and academic study rather than adoption of practices. Encourage critical thinking about the ethics of cross-cultural spiritual exploration.

3. Challenge: Students may have preconceptions or biases about shamanic practices.
   Tip: Begin with a discussion about personal beliefs and the importance of academic objectivity. Emphasize the cultural and historical context of these practices.

   Tip: Provide a clear framework for comparison, focusing on specific aspects like social role, techniques used, or cosmological beliefs.

5. Challenge: Balancing academic study with respect for living traditions.
   Tip: Invite local spiritual practitioners as guest speakers when appropriate, and always frame discussions in terms of cultural understanding rather than judgment or evaluation.
