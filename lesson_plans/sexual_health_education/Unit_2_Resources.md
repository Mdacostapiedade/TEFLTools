  - Reversible (can be withdrawn at any time)
  - Informed (all parties understand what they're agreeing to)
  - Enthusiastic (all parties actively want to participate)
  - Specific (agreement to one activity doesn't imply agreement to others)
- Importance of setting personal boundaries in relationships
- Types of boundaries:
  - Physical (personal space, touch)
  - Emotional (sharing feelings, time spent together)
  - Sexual (intimacy levels, preferences)
  - Digital (social media, privacy)

## Effective Communication in Relationships

- Active listening: Fully focusing on and understanding your partner
- "I" statements: Expressing feelings without blaming (e.g., "I feel hurt when..." instead of "You always...")
- Non-verbal communication: Body language, facial expressions, tone of voice
- Assertiveness: Expressing needs and feelings clearly and respectfully
- Empathy: Trying to understand your partner's perspective
- Conflict resolution strategies:
  - Choose the right time and place to discuss issues
  - Focus on the problem, not the person
  - Use "we" language to emphasize partnership
  - Seek compromise and win-win solutions
