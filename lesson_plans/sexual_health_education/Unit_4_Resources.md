## Case Study: Maria's Story

Maria is a 19-year-old woman from a rural village in Timor-Leste. She was the first in her family to complete secondary school and dreams of becoming a nurse. However, her parents expect her to get married soon and start a family. Maria's boyfriend supports her ambitions but faces pressure from his family to conform to traditional gender roles.

Maria recently learned about contraceptive options at a local health clinic but is unsure how to discuss this with her boyfriend or family. She's also concerned about the cost of continuing her education and the limited job opportunities in her area.

Use this case study to discuss:
- The clash between traditional expectations and changing aspirations for young women in Timor-Leste
- The importance of sexual and reproductive rights in enabling young people to plan their futures
- The role of education and economic opportunities in changing gender dynamics
- Strategies for communicating about sensitive topics with partners and family members
