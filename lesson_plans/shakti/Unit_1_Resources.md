## Overview of Shaktism and its place in Hinduism

### Definition and Origins
- Shaktism is a major tradition within Hinduism that reveres Shakti or Devi (the divine feminine power) as the Supreme Deity
- Origins trace back to prehistoric goddess worship in the Indus Valley Civilization (3300-1300 BCE)
- Developed alongside other Hindu traditions, gaining prominence in the medieval period (6th-15th centuries CE)

### Place within Hinduism
- One of the major branches of Hinduism, alongside Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Smartism
- Interrelated with other traditions, particularly Shaivism
- Emphasizes the feminine aspect of the divine, seeing it as the source of all creation and power

### Core Beliefs and Practices
- Shakti is the primordial cosmic energy and the dynamic force behind all existence
- The goddess is worshipped in various forms, including Durga, Kali, Lakshmi, and Saraswati
- Practices include puja (worship), mantra recitation, yantra meditation, and Tantric rituals
- Emphasis on the unity of the divine masculine (Shiva) and divine feminine (Shakti)

## Introduction to Goddess Worship in Timorese Culture

### Brief History of Animistic Traditions in Timor Leste
- Animism has been the traditional belief system in Timor Leste for thousands of years
- Belief in lulik (sacred) objects, places, and spirits that influence daily life
- Complex system of rituals and taboos to maintain harmony with the spirit world

### Role of Female Spirits and Deities
- Female spirits often associated with nature, fertility, and protection
- Examples include:
  * Bee Mau Railaku: goddess of the earth and agriculture
  * Nai Feto: female spirit of the sea
  * Feto Ikun: protective female ancestor spirits

### Influence of Catholicism on Traditional Practices
- Portuguese colonization introduced Catholicism in the 16th century
- Syncretic practices developed, blending Catholic and animistic beliefs
- Many Timorese maintain dual religious identities, practicing both Catholicism and traditional beliefs

## Key Concepts

### Shakti as Divine Power and Energy
- Shakti represents the active, dynamic principle of reality
- Manifests as both creative and destructive forces in the universe
- Inseparable from consciousness (often represented by Shiva)

### Devi as the Supreme Goddess
- Devi is the personification of Shakti
- Worshipped in various forms, each representing different aspects of divine power
- Both transcendent (beyond creation) and immanent (present in all things)

### Divine Feminine in Nature and Society
- Recognition of feminine power in natural cycles and phenomena
- Emphasis on the nurturing and protective aspects of the divine
- Potential for empowerment of women through goddess worship
