## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited prior knowledge of Hinduism or Timorese traditions.
   **Solution**: Provide a brief overview of both religious contexts at the beginning of the lesson. Consider assigning pre-reading materials.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in drawing connections between Hindu and Timorese traditions.
   **Solution**: Use visual aids like the Venn diagram to highlight similarities and differences. Encourage students to think critically about common themes in goddess worship.

3. **Challenge**: Sensitivity around discussing religious practices.
   **Solution**: Emphasize respect for all traditions. Frame discussions in terms of cultural and historical analysis rather than personal beliefs.

4. **Challenge**: Limited resources on Timorese spiritual practices.
   **Solution**: Collaborate with local community members or cultural institutions. Encourage students to conduct oral history interviews when appropriate.

5. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with the timeline creation activity.
   **Solution**: Provide a structured template and clear guidelines. Consider doing a brief example as a class before group work begins.

6. **Challenge**: Difficulty in pronouncing Sanskrit or Timorese terms.
   **Solution**: Create a pronunciation guide for key terms. Practice pronunciations as a class during the vocabulary introduction.
