# Excerpts from Shakta Texts

## Devi Mahatmya (Chapter 1, verses 75-81)

```
75. You are the supreme knowledge, and the great nescience,
    The great intellect and contemplation,
    The great delusion, the great devi,
    The great demoness, the great goddess.

76. You are the primordial cause of everything,
    Bringing into force the three gunas,
    You are the dark night of periodic dissolution,
    You are the great night of final dissolution.

77. You are the goddess of good fortune, the ruler,
    You are modesty, intelligence characterized by knowledge,
    You are nourishment, contentment, tranquility and forgiveness.

78. Terrible with sharp swords and spears,
    You are at the same time pleasing to behold:
    You terrify and bestow fearlessness at once.

79. You are protective and destructive,
    O Devi, you pervade this entire world.
    Who else but you, O Goddess,
    Is seated upon pure consciousness?

80. In the form of consciousness you pervade
    All these - gods, animals and men.
    O Devi, being beyond the gunas,
    What praise can reach you?

81. O Devi, by whom the Creator of the world,
    The Protector, and the Destroyer are created,
    Who can be capable of praising you?
```

## Soundarya Lahari (verses 1-5)

```
1. Shiva, united with Shakti, becomes able to manifest
   If otherwise, this god knows not even how to pulsate
   How then could one of ungained merit be capable
   Of bowing to you or of even praising you, O Queen of Kanchipura?

2. Not even a billionth part of your glory, O Devi
   Could Brahma, Vishnu, or Shiva comprehend
   How then could one of limited intellect like me
   Aspire to compose a hymn in your praise?

3. O Devi, your feet rest upon the heads of Brahma and others
   Your anklets are studded with rubies as red as the evening sun
   May their jingling sound dispel the impurities of my mind
   And create pure thoughts in their place

4. O Mother, may your gracious glance,
   Which is cool like the rays of the moon,
   Fall upon me and remove the burning pain
   Caused by worldly afflictions

5. O Goddess, your face surpasses the moon in beauty
   Your hair is darker than the darkest clouds
   How wonderful that the Creator made your neck
   The meeting place of light and darkness
```

# Lecture Notes

## Concept of Shakti as Supreme Power

1. Definition of Shakti
   - Sanskrit word meaning "power" or "energy"
   - In Shaktism, the primordial cosmic energy
   - The dynamic force of the universe

2. Significance in Shaktism
   - Shakti is personified as the Supreme Goddess
   - Considered the ultimate reality and source of all creation
   - Both transcendent and immanent

3. Shakti as the dynamic aspect of Brahman
   - Brahman: the ultimate, unchanging reality
   - Shakti: the active, creative principle
   - Inseparable, like fire and its burning power

4. Manifestations of Shakti
   - As various goddesses: Durga, Kali, Lakshmi, etc.
   - In nature: rivers, mountains, trees
   - Within living beings: kundalini energy

5. Philosophical implications
   - Non-dualistic view of reality
   - Material world as real, not illusory
   - Emphasis on divine immanence

## Relationship between Shiva and Shakti

1. Non-dualistic nature
   - Shiva and Shakti as two aspects of one reality
   - Shiva: static, masculine principle (consciousness)
   - Shakti: dynamic, feminine principle (energy)

2. Interdependence
   - Shiva powerless without Shakti
   - Shakti formless without Shiva
   - Complementary rather than hierarchical

3. Symbolism in iconography
   - Ardhanarishvara: half-male, half-female form
   - Shiva as corpse without Shakti
   - Shakti dancing on Shiva's chest

4. Philosophical concepts
   - Prakasha (light) and Vimarsha (reflection)
   - Saguna (with attributes) and Nirguna (without attributes)

5. Tantric practices
   - Union of Shiva and Shakti within the practitioner
   - Kundalini awakening as internal Shiva-Shakti union

## Timorese Concepts of Spiritual Power

1. Lulik: Sacred power in Timorese tradition
   - Meaning "sacred," "forbidden," or "taboo"
   - Pervasive force in nature and society
   - Source of both blessings and dangers

2. Animistic worldview
   - Belief in spirits inhabiting natural features
   - Ancestors as active participants in daily life
   - Sacred places as focal points of spiritual power

3. Role of ancestral spirits
   - Mediators between living and divine realms
   - Source of guidance and protection
   - Recipients of offerings and rituals

4. Nature spirits and their domains
   - Mountains, trees, rivers as spirit abodes
   - Spirits as guardians of natural resources
   - Rituals to appease or seek blessings from nature spirits

5. Concept of spiritual balance
   - Harmony between human, natural, and spirit worlds
   - Rituals and taboos to maintain balance
   - Consequences of disturbing the spiritual order

## Comparative Analysis: Shakta and Timorese Concepts

1. Similarities
   - Recognition of pervasive spiritual power in nature
   - Importance of female/feminine spiritual entities
   - Emphasis on maintaining cosmic balance

2. Differences
   - Level of personification (goddesses vs. spirits)
   - Philosophical sophistication (developed metaphysics vs. practical animism)
   - Ritual complexity and standardization

3. Influence of animism
   - Present in both traditions, more central in Timorese spirituality
   - Shakta incorporation of local nature spirits into goddess pantheon
   - Timorese focus on specific local spirits and ancestors

4. Approach to the divine feminine
   - Shakta: systematized goddess worship
   - Timorese: less centralized, varied local practices

5. Syncretism and adaptation
   - Shakta absorption of local goddess traditions
   - Timorese incorporation of Catholic elements in some areas

8. In what ways might Shakta and Timorese spiritual concepts complement or conflict with each other? How might followers of each tradition view the other?
