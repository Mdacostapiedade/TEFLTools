## Excerpt from David Kinsley's "Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition"

"The goddess Kali is one of the most popular goddesses in the Hindu pantheon. She is also one of the most misunderstood. Her fierce appearance and association with death and destruction have led many to view her as a negative force. However, for her devotees, Kali represents the ultimate reality beyond all forms and the power of transformation.

Kali's iconography is rich with symbolism. Her black skin represents the ultimate void from which all creation emerges and to which it returns. The garland of skulls around her neck symbolizes the cycle of birth and death, reminding us of the impermanence of physical existence. Her protruding tongue, often interpreted as bloodthirsty, actually represents her surprise at seeing her consort Shiva beneath her feet, a moment of self-recognition in which she realizes her own divine nature.

For her worshippers, Kali is not just a destroyer but also a loving mother. Her fierce aspect is seen as necessary to combat evil and negative forces in the world and within ourselves. By confronting and embracing Kali, devotees seek to transcend their fears and limitations, moving towards spiritual liberation."
