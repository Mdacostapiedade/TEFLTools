## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have misconceptions about Tantra due to its portrayal in popular media.
   **Solution**: Address these misconceptions directly at the beginning of the lesson. Emphasize the spiritual and philosophical aspects of Tantra.

2. **Challenge**: Some students may feel uncomfortable with unfamiliar religious practices.
   **Solution**: Maintain a respectful, academic approach. Clarify that participation in demonstrations is optional and for educational purposes only.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty in pronouncing Sanskrit terms.
   **Solution**: Provide phonetic pronunciations for key terms. Practice saying them together as a class.

5. **Challenge**: Time management, especially during the puja demonstration.
   **Solution**: Prepare a simplified version of the puja beforehand. Use a timer and have clear transitions between each part of the lesson.
