1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited prior knowledge of either Hindu or Timorese traditions.
   **Solution**: Provide brief background readings before the lesson and use visual aids to introduce key concepts.

2. **Challenge**: Discussing religious practices may be sensitive for some students.
   **Solution**: Establish ground rules for respectful discussion and emphasize the academic nature of the study.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to understand the concept of syncretism.
   **Solution**: Use familiar examples of cultural blending (e.g., in food or music) before applying the concept to religious practices.

4. **Challenge**: Keeping track of various regional traditions may be overwhelming.
   **Solution**: Use color-coding on maps and charts to help students visually organize information.

5. **Challenge**: Students may have difficulty relating to unfamiliar cultural practices.
   **Solution**: Encourage students to find parallels with their own cultural or religious experiences and discuss the universal aspects of spirituality.
