# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Vocal Anatomy and Physiology

## Resources Needed
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with diagrams of the larynx and respiratory system
- Computer and projector for displaying images and videos
- Blank paper and colored pencils for student diagrams
- Audio recordings of various Timorese vocal styles

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify the main structures of the larynx and their functions
2. Explain the role of the respiratory system in singing
3. Describe at least three traditional Timorese vocal health practices

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Students pair up and take turns feeling each other's larynx while humming
- Class discussion on what they observed and felt

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)
- Introduce and define key terms: larynx, vocal folds, trachea, diaphragm, resonance
- Students create a vocabulary chart with definitions and Tetum translations

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Overview of laryngeal anatomy
   - Show diagrams and explain functions of vocal folds, arytenoid cartilages, and thyroid cartilage
   - Demonstrate with a simple model made from rubber bands

2. Respiratory system and its role in singing
   - Explain diaphragmatic breathing using diagrams and physical demonstrations
   - Discuss the connection between breath support and vocal production

3. Vocal health practices in Timorese culture
   - Present common traditional remedies and practices
   - Discuss the scientific basis (if any) behind these practices

## Practice Activities (20 minutes)
1. Students create their own labeled diagram of the vocal folds and surrounding structures
2. In small groups, students practice diaphragmatic breathing exercises

## Production Tasks (30 minutes)
1. Group discussion on traditional Timorese vocal health remedies
   - Students share remedies they know from their families or communities
   - Class compiles a list of practices and discusses potential benefits or risks

2. Role-play activity: Students act out scenarios demonstrating proper and improper vocal use

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
- Quick quiz on key anatomical structures and their functions
- Students summarize the main points of the lesson in their own words

## Homework Assignment
1. Research and write a short report on a traditional Timorese vocal style, including any specific vocal techniques or health practices associated with it
2. Practice diaphragmatic breathing for 10 minutes daily and keep a log of observations

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Larynx: The voice box, containing the vocal folds
- Vocal folds: Paired membranes that vibrate to produce voice
- Trachea: The windpipe, carrying air to and from the lungs
- Diaphragm: The primary muscle of respiration, separating the chest and abdominal cavities
- Resonance: The amplification and enrichment of vocal tone by the air-filled cavities above the larynx
