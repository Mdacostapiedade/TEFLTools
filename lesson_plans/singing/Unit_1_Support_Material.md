# Support Material for Vocal Anatomy and Physiology Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Larynx**: The voice box, containing the vocal folds
- **Vocal folds**: Paired membranes that vibrate to produce voice
- **Trachea**: The windpipe, carrying air to and from the lungs
- **Diaphragm**: The primary muscle of respiration, separating the chest and abdominal cavities
- **Resonance**: The amplification and enrichment of vocal tone by the air-filled cavities above the larynx
- **Arytenoid cartilages**: Small, paired cartilages in the larynx that help control vocal fold movement
- **Thyroid cartilage**: The largest cartilage of the larynx, forming the "Adam's apple"
- **Breath support**: The controlled exhalation of air to sustain vocal sound

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. Diagram of the Larynx:
   - Front and side view of the larynx
   - Labeled parts: vocal folds, thyroid cartilage, arytenoid cartilages
   - Color-coded to distinguish cartilages from soft tissues

2. Respiratory System Diagram:
   - Cross-section of the upper body
   - Highlighted structures: lungs, diaphragm, trachea, bronchi
   - Arrows indicating airflow during inhalation and exhalation

3. Simple Vocal Fold Model:
   - Two rubber bands stretched over an open cylindrical container
   - Demonstrates how air passing through causes vibration

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. Vocal Anatomy Labeling Exercise:
   - Blank diagram of the larynx for students to label
   - Word bank with key structures
   - Space for students to write brief descriptions of each part's function

2. Diaphragmatic Breathing Checklist:
   - Step-by-step guide to proper diaphragmatic breathing technique
   - Self-assessment checklist for students to monitor their progress

3. Timorese Vocal Health Practices Survey:
   - Table for students to record traditional remedies or practices
   - Columns for: Practice/Remedy, Purported Benefit, Scientific Basis (if known)

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Online Resources:
   - National Center for Voice and Speech (www.ncvs.org) - Tutorials on vocal anatomy
   - Vocalist.org.uk - Breathing exercises for singers

2. Books:
   - "Anatomy of the Voice" by Theodore Dimon Jr.
   - "The Voice Book" by Kate DeVore and Starr Cookman

3. Videos:
   - YouTube channel "Voice Science Works" - Animated explanations of vocal anatomy
   - TED-Ed video: "How Your Voice Works" by Kim Cunio

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling to feel or understand laryngeal movement
   - Tip: Use mirrors for visual feedback, or have students gently place fingers on their larynx while producing various sounds

2. Challenge: Difficulty in grasping the concept of diaphragmatic breathing
   - Tip: Use hands-on demonstrations, such as having students lie on their backs with books on their stomachs to observe proper movement

3. Challenge: Skepticism about traditional Timorese vocal health practices
   - Tip: Encourage open discussion and critical thinking, emphasizing cultural respect while also introducing scientific perspectives

4. Challenge: Language barriers in understanding anatomical terms
   - Tip: Provide Tetum translations for key terms and use visual aids extensively

5. Challenge: Maintaining engagement during anatomy-heavy sections
   - Tip: Intersperse theoretical content with practical exercises and relate anatomy directly to singing experiences
