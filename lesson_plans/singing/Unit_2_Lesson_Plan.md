# Lesson Plan: Breath Control and Support for Timorese Singers

## Resources Needed
- Yoga mats or towels for floor exercises
- Mirrors for visual feedback
- Recording of traditional Timorese lullaby
- Handouts with diagrams of diaphragmatic breathing
- Metronome or drum for rhythm exercises

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Demonstrate proper diaphragmatic breathing technique
2. Apply breath support to sustain phrases in Timorese folk songs
3. Identify and reproduce breath patterns common in Timorese vocal music

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
1. Students lie on their backs on yoga mats
2. Guide students through a body scan relaxation exercise
3. Introduce gentle breathing awareness, focusing on the rise and fall of the abdomen

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)
- Diaphragm
- Intercostal muscles
- Breath support
- Appoggio
- Phrase

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)
1. Explain the concept of diaphragmatic breathing using diagrams
2. Demonstrate the difference between shallow chest breathing and deep diaphragmatic breathing
3. Discuss the role of intercostal muscles in breath support
4. Introduce the concept of appoggio and its importance in sustaining phrases
5. Analyze breath patterns in a recorded example of Timorese folk music

## Practice Activities (30 minutes)
1. Diaphragmatic breathing exercise:
   - Students place one hand on chest, one on abdomen
   - Practice breathing so only the lower hand moves
2. Hissing exercise for breath control:
   - Inhale for 4 counts, exhale on a hiss for 8 counts
   - Gradually increase exhale duration
3. Partner breathing observation:
   - In pairs, students observe each other's breathing and provide feedback
4. Rhythmic breathing to Timorese beats:
   - Use metronome or drum to set traditional Timorese rhythms
   - Students synchronize their breath with the rhythm

## Production Tasks (30 minutes)
1. Phrase sustaining exercise:
   - Students sing long tones, focusing on consistent breath support
   - Gradually increase the length of sustained notes
2. Timorese lullaby performance:
   - Teach a simple traditional Timorese lullaby
   - Students perform in small groups, emphasizing breath control

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
1. Quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson
2. Students share one new insight they gained about breathing for singing
3. Brief discussion on how improved breath control can enhance Timorese vocal performances

## Homework Assignment
1. Daily practice of diaphragmatic breathing exercises (10 minutes per day)
2. Record yourself singing a verse of the Timorese lullaby, focusing on breath support
3. Observe and document your breathing while singing along with a recording of a traditional Timorese song
