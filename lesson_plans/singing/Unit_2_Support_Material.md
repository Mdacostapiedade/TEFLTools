# Support Material for Breath Control and Support Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Diaphragm**: The dome-shaped muscle below the lungs that is essential for breathing
- **Intercostal muscles**: Muscles between the ribs that assist in breathing
- **Breath support**: The controlled release of air to maintain consistent vocal tone
- **Appoggio**: An Italian term meaning "to lean," referring to a breathing technique that balances air pressure and muscular support
- **Phrase**: A musical unit typically requiring one breath to sing
- **Diaphragmatic breathing**: A breathing technique that engages the diaphragm, allowing for deeper, more efficient breaths
- **Breath control**: The ability to manage the inhalation and exhalation of air while singing
- **Sustained tone**: A musical note held for an extended duration with consistent quality

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. Diagram of the Respiratory System:
   - Illustration showing the lungs, diaphragm, and ribcage
   - Arrows indicating the movement of the diaphragm during inhalation and exhalation

2. Comparison of Chest Breathing vs. Diaphragmatic Breathing:
   - Side-by-side illustrations of a person breathing
   - Chest breathing: Upper chest expands, shoulders rise
   - Diaphragmatic breathing: Lower abdomen expands, chest remains relatively still

3. Appoggio Technique Visualization:
   - Cross-section view of the torso
   - Arrows showing the balanced tension between the diaphragm, abdominal muscles, and intercostal muscles

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. Diaphragmatic Breathing Practice Log:
   - Daily checklist for breathing exercises
   - Space to record observations and improvements

2. Timorese Lullaby Lyrics Sheet:

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling to feel diaphragmatic movement
   - Tip: Use tactile cues like placing a hand on the abdomen or using a light book as resistance

2. Challenge: Maintaining consistent breath support throughout phrases
   - Tip: Start with shorter phrases and gradually increase length; use visual aids like ribbons to represent air flow

3. Challenge: Applying breath techniques to Timorese songs
   - Tip: Begin with simple, repetitive melodies before progressing to more complex traditional songs

4. Challenge: Overcoming habitual chest breathing
   - Tip: Incorporate regular reminders and checks throughout the lesson; encourage practice in non-singing activities

5. Challenge: Adapting Western breathing techniques to Timorese vocal styles
   - Tip: Explicitly discuss and demonstrate how principles can be applied to local music; invite a traditional singer to demonstrate their technique
