# Lesson Plan: Resonance and Tone Production

## 1. Resources Needed

- Recordings of traditional Timorese singers
- Mirrors for each student
- Tuning forks or pitch pipes
- Handouts with diagrams of the vocal tract
- Audio playback equipment
- Whiteboard and markers

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the concept of vocal resonance
- Identify and manipulate their own vocal resonators
- Recognize and reproduce characteristic resonance qualities in Timorese vocal music
- Apply vowel modification techniques to enhance tone quality

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Gentle physical stretches focusing on the neck and shoulders
- Humming exercises, starting with lip trills and progressing to nasal consonants
- Five-note scale patterns on different vowel sounds

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)

Introduce and explain:
- Resonance
- Formants
- Vocal tract
- Vowel modification

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)

- Explain the concept of vocal resonance using diagrams of the vocal tract
- Demonstrate how changes in the shape of the vocal tract affect resonance
- Discuss the role of formants in creating vowel sounds and tone color
- Introduce the concept of vowel modification for enhancing tone quality
- Play examples of Timorese vocal music, highlighting unique resonance characteristics

## 6. Practice Activities (25 minutes)

- Students experiment with resonance by humming while changing mouth shapes
- Paired activity: One student produces a sustained vowel while the other gently manipulates their partner's cheeks and lips to alter resonance
- Group exercise: Students attempt to match the resonance quality of a played Timorese vocal recording

## 7. Production Tasks (20 minutes)

- Students perform short phrases from a traditional Timorese song, focusing on recreating authentic resonance qualities
- Individual presentations: Each student demonstrates a before-and-after of a single sustained note, showing how they can modify resonance

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (5 minutes)

- Recap key points about resonance and its importance in Timorese vocal style
- Quick Q&A session to address any lingering questions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Record a one-minute sample of your own singing, analyzing your resonance qualities
- Practice vowel modification exercises provided in a handout
- Listen to and analyze the resonance in two contrasting Timorese vocal recordings

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Resonance: The amplification and enrichment of vocal tone by the air-filled cavities above and below the vocal folds
- Formants: Concentrated areas of acoustic energy that define vowel sounds and contribute to vocal timbre
- Vocal tract: The air-filled cavities above the vocal folds, including the throat, mouth, and nasal passages
- Vowel modification: The intentional adjustment of vowel shapes to enhance resonance and tone quality
