# Lecture Notes

## Vocal Tract Resonance

### Introduction to Resonance
- Definition: Resonance is the amplification and enrichment of vocal tone by the air-filled cavities above and below the vocal folds.
- Primary resonators: pharynx, oral cavity, nasal cavity
- Secondary resonators: sinuses, chest cavity

### The Vocal Tract as a Resonator
- Shape and size affect resonance
- Adjustable parts: soft palate, tongue, lips, jaw
- Fixed parts: hard palate, teeth

### Resonance Manipulation
- Raising or lowering the larynx
- Tongue position (forward/back, high/low)
- Lip rounding or spreading
- Jaw opening

## Formants and Vowel Modification

### Understanding Formants
- Definition: Concentrated areas of acoustic energy that define vowel sounds and contribute to vocal timbre
- First formant (F1): related to tongue height
- Second formant (F2): related to tongue advancement
- Higher formants: contribute to individual voice quality

### Vowel Modification Techniques
- Adjusting mouth shape to enhance resonance
- Maintaining vowel integrity while modifying for better tone
- Common modifications in high notes: 
  * [i] to [ɪ]
  * [e] to [ɛ]
  * [a] to [ʌ]

### Application in Different Vocal Styles
- Classical singing: consistent vowel modification across range
- Contemporary styles: varied approaches to modification

## Resonance Characteristics in Timorese Vocal Music

### Traditional Timorese Vocal Qualities
- Bright, forward placement in many styles
- Use of nasality in certain genres
- Open throat technique in ritual songs

### Regional Variations
- Eastern Timor: more nasal qualities
- Western Timor: fuller chest resonance

### Influence of Portuguese Fado
- Incorporation of darker vowels in some modern Timorese styles

# Discussion Questions

1. How does understanding vocal tract resonance help you as a singer?
2. In what ways might Timorese traditional singing techniques differ from Western classical techniques in terms of resonance?
3. How can vowel modification enhance your singing, and what are potential drawbacks?
4. Discuss the balance between maintaining linguistic clarity and achieving optimal resonance in singing.
5. How might the unique linguistic features of Tetum influence resonance choices in Timorese vocal music?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Resonance Analysis Essay

Write a 500-word essay analyzing the resonance characteristics of a traditional Timorese song of your choice. Include the following elements:

1. Brief background of the chosen song
2. Description of the overall tonal quality
3. Analysis of specific resonance techniques used by the singer(s)
4. Comparison with a non-Timorese vocal style
5. Your personal reflection on how understanding these resonance qualities might influence your own singing

# Assignment Details

## Resonance Experiment and Documentation

1. Choose three vowel sounds common in Timorese language.
2. For each vowel:
   a. Sustain the vowel in your speaking voice
   b. Modify the vowel by changing mouth shape while maintaining the same pitch
   c. Record the different variations
3. Analyze the recordings, noting changes in resonance
4. Create a short (2-3 minute) video presentation demonstrating your findings
5. Include a written report (300-400 words) explaining your process and conclusions
