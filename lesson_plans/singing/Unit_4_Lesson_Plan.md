# Lesson Plan: Articulation and Diction for Timorese Singers

## Resources Needed
- Handouts with Tetum tongue twisters
- Lyrics sheets for a Portuguese fado song
- Audio recordings of native Tetum and Portuguese speakers
- Mirrors for students to observe their articulation
- Whiteboard and markers

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Articulate Tetum and Portuguese phonemes clearly while singing
2. Identify common diction challenges in Timorese songs
3. Demonstrate improved clarity of consonants and vowels in singing
4. Balance clear articulation with proper vocal tone

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
1. Facial muscle warm-up: Students make exaggerated facial expressions
2. Lip trills and tongue twisters in Tetum to loosen articulators
3. Gentle humming exercises to engage resonance

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)
- Phoneme: The smallest unit of sound in a language
- Articulation: The formation of clear and distinct sounds in speech
- Diction: Clarity of pronunciation in singing or speaking

   - Demonstrate how over-articulation can affect tone quality

## Practice Activities (25 minutes)
1. Tetum Tongue Twisters (10 minutes)
   - Students practice provided tongue twisters in pairs
   - Focus on speed and clarity of articulation
2. Portuguese Vowel Sounds (10 minutes)
   - Group practice of Portuguese vowels in isolation
   - Incorporate vowels into simple melodic patterns
3. Consonant Precision Drills (5 minutes)

1. Quick recap of key points covered in the lesson
2. Students share one new insight they gained about articulation
3. Address any remaining questions or concerns

## Homework Assignment
1. Practice Tetum tongue twisters daily for 10 minutes
2. Record yourself singing a verse of a Timorese song, focusing on clear diction
3. Transcribe and practice the lyrics of a Portuguese fado, marking challenging words
