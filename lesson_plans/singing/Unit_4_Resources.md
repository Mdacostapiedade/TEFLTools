# Lecture Notes

## Tetum and Portuguese Phonemes

### Tetum Phonemes
- Vowels: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/
- Consonants: /b/, /d/, /f/, /g/, /h/, /k/, /l/, /m/, /n/, /p/, /r/, /s/, /t/, /w/, /ʔ/ (glottal stop)
- Unique sounds:
  * /ñ/ - similar to Spanish "ñ"
  * /kh/ - aspirated "k"

- Nasal vowels: /ɐ̃/, /ẽ/, /ĩ/, /õ/, /ũ/
- Consonants: /b/, /d/, /f/, /g/, /k/, /l/, /ʎ/, /m/, /n/, /ɲ/, /p/, /ʁ/, /s/, /ʃ/, /t/, /v/, /z/, /ʒ/
- Unique sounds:
  * /ʎ/ - similar to "lli" in million
  * /ɲ/ - similar to Spanish "ñ"

## Diction Challenges in Timorese Songs

1. Consonant clusters
   - Example: "kmanek" (beautiful) in Tetum
   - Technique: Practice slow articulation, gradually increase speed

2. Glottal stops
   - Common in Tetum, not present in Portuguese
   - Technique: Practice with mirror, observing throat movement

3. Nasal vowels in Portuguese
   - Not present in Tetum
   - Technique: Use "ng" sound to find proper placement

4. Rolled 'r' in Portuguese
   - Technique: Practice "butter" exercise, tongue trill

5. Final consonants
   - Often dropped in Tetum, important in Portuguese
   - Technique: Exaggerate final consonants in practice

## Balancing Articulation with Vocal Tone

1. Forward placement
   - Definition: Focusing sound towards front of mouth
   - Benefits: Improves clarity without sacrificing tone
   - Technique: Imagine speaking to someone far away

2. Resonance balance
   - Maintain open throat while articulating clearly
   - Use "ng" sound to find balance between clarity and richness

3. Consonant energy
   - Quick, precise consonants to maintain vocal line
   - Avoid "chewing" on consonants

4. Vowel modification
   - Slight adjustments for high notes to maintain tone
   - Keep tongue relaxed and low

5. Articulation exercises
   - Lip trills with text
   - Staccato exercises on consonants

# Discussion Questions

1. How do the phonemes in Tetum differ from those in Portuguese? How might this affect a singer's approach to each language?

2. What are some unique diction challenges you've encountered in Timorese songs? How have you addressed them?
