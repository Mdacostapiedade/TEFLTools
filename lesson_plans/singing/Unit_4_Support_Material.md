- **Over-articulation**: Exaggerated pronunciation that can negatively affect vocal tone or natural speech patterns

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Mouth Position Diagram:
   - Description: A cross-section diagram of the mouth and throat, showing tongue positions for challenging Tetum and Portuguese phonemes. Label key areas such as the hard palate, soft palate, and various tongue positions.

2. Articulation Points Chart:
   - Description: A front-view diagram of the mouth, lips, and teeth, with arrows pointing to different articulation points for consonants in Tetum and Portuguese. Include examples of words using each articulation point.

3. Vowel Chart:
   - Description: A chart showing the mouth shapes for Portuguese vowels, with arrows indicating lip and tongue positions. Include IPA symbols and example words for each vowel sound.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with unfamiliar Portuguese sounds
   - Tip: Break down sounds into familiar components, use visual aids, and provide plenty of listening examples

2. Challenge: Maintaining vocal tone while focusing on articulation
   - Tip: Emphasize the importance of relaxation, start with slower tempos, and gradually increase speed as clarity improves

3. Challenge: Addressing individual articulation issues in a group setting
   - Tip: Use peer teaching, where students work in pairs to give feedback, and incorporate individual check-ins during group activities

4. Challenge: Balancing traditional Timorese pronunciation with standardized Portuguese
   - Tip: Discuss the importance of both and when each might be appropriate. Encourage students to learn both forms where relevant

5. Challenge: Students becoming overly focused on technical aspects at the expense of musicality
   - Tip: Regularly bring focus back to the emotional content of the songs. Incorporate exercises that combine technical focus with expressive singing
