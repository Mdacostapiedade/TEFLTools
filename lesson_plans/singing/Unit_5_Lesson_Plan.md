# Lesson Plan: Vocal Registers and Range Development

## Resources Needed
- Piano or keyboard
- Audio playback device
- Recordings of Timorese vocal music showcasing different registers
- Handouts with diagrams of vocal registers
- Mirror for each student or one large mirror

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify and describe the different vocal registers (chest voice, head voice, mixed voice)
2. Demonstrate the ability to sing in each register
3. Execute smooth transitions between registers
4. Analyze register use in Timorese vocal styles
5. Apply techniques for safely expanding vocal range

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
1. Physical warm-up: Neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, gentle stretches
2. Breathing exercise: Diaphragmatic breathing with focus on steady exhalation
3. Vocal sirens: Sliding smoothly from low to high pitch and back, exploring full range

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)
- Chest voice
- Head voice
- Mixed voice
- Passaggio
- Vocal break
- Falsetto

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (20 minutes)
1. Explain and demonstrate the characteristics of each vocal register:
   - Chest voice: Lower range, fuller sound, vibrations felt in chest
   - Head voice: Higher range, lighter sound, vibrations felt in head
   - Mixed voice: Blend of chest and head, balanced tone
2. Discuss the concept of passaggio (transition points between registers)
3. Demonstrate register transitions using scales and arpeggios
4. Play recordings of Timorese vocal music, identifying register use

## Practice Activities (25 minutes)
1. Register identification:
   - Students listen to various vocal examples and identify the register being used
2. Register exploration:
   - Students sing simple phrases in each register, focusing on the physical sensations
3. Register transitions:
   - Students practice scales and arpeggios, focusing on smooth transitions through passaggio points
4. Timorese song analysis:
   - In small groups, students analyze register use in a traditional Timorese song

## Production Tasks (20 minutes)
1. Register demonstration:
   - Students perform a short melody, deliberately switching between registers to demonstrate control
2. Timorese song performance:
   - Students perform a section of a Timorese song, applying appropriate register use and transitions

## Wrap-up and Review (5 minutes)
1. Recap the main characteristics of each vocal register
2. Discuss the importance of register awareness in Timorese vocal styles
3. Address any questions or concerns about register use and transitions

## Homework Assignment
1. Practice register transitions using provided vocal exercises (15 minutes daily)
2. Record yourself singing a Timorese song, focusing on intentional register use
3. Listen to and analyze register use in three different Timorese vocal recordings

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Chest voice: The lower register of the voice, characterized by a fuller, richer tone
- Head voice: The higher register of the voice, characterized by a lighter, brighter tone
- Mixed voice: A blend of chest and head voice, creating a balanced tone throughout the range
- Passaggio: The transition area between vocal registers
- Vocal break: An audible shift or crack in the voice when changing registers
- Falsetto: A light, airy quality in the upper range, typically associated with male voices
