## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students skeptical about the effectiveness of sound healing
   - Tip: Provide scientific studies on the effects of sound on the body and brain. Encourage open-mindedness and personal experience.

2. Challenge: Lack of traditional instruments
   - Tip: Improvise with everyday objects that make interesting sounds. Emphasize that the voice is a powerful healing instrument.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in pronouncing or reproducing traditional Timorese chants
   - Tip: Break down chants into smaller, manageable parts. Invite a local expert to demonstrate and guide pronunciation.

4. Challenge: Cultural sensitivity concerns
   - Tip: Emphasize respect for traditional practices. Discuss the importance of preserving cultural heritage while exploring new healing modalities.

5. Challenge: Students feeling self-conscious about using their voices
   - Tip: Start with group activities to build confidence. Remind students that healing sounds don't need to be "pretty" to be effective.

6. Challenge: Maintaining a quiet environment for listening exercises
   - Tip: Choose a suitable time and location for the class. Use noise-cancelling headphones if available, or create a "sound sanctuary" in the classroom.
