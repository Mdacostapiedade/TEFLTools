# Lesson Plan: Instruments in Sound Healing

## 1. Resources Needed

- Various sound healing instruments (singing bowls, drums, gongs, chimes, etc.)
- Local Timorese instruments with healing potential
- Audio playback equipment
- Handouts with instrument descriptions and basic playing techniques
- Whiteboard and markers
- Cushions or mats for students to sit on

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify and describe at least 5 common instruments used in sound healing
- Demonstrate basic playing techniques for 2-3 selected instruments
- Explain the potential healing effects of different instruments
- Create a simple sound healing composition using local Timorese instruments

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Sound Scavenger Hunt: In small groups, students have 5 minutes to find and create as many different sounds as possible using objects in the room (not the instruments).
- Groups demonstrate their most interesting sounds to the class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Write the following terms on the whiteboard and briefly explain each:
- Resonance
- Vibration
- Timbre
- Frequency
- Harmonic
- Overtone

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of common sound healing instruments:
  - Singing bowls (Tibetan and crystal)
  - Gongs
  - Drums
  - Chimes and bells
  - Tuning forks
- Demonstrate each instrument, explaining:
  - How it's played
  - Its unique sound qualities
  - Potential healing effects
- Introduction to local Timorese instruments with healing potential:
  - Discuss traditional uses in ceremonies or rituals
  - Demonstrate playing techniques
  - Explain how these can be incorporated into sound healing practices

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

- Instrument Rotation:
  - Set up stations with different instruments
  - Students rotate through stations in small groups
  - At each station, they practice basic playing techniques and experience the instrument's vibrations
- Guided Listening:
  - Play recordings of different instruments
  - Students close their eyes and focus on how each sound affects their body and emotions
  - Brief sharing of experiences after each sound

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

- In small groups, students create a 2-3 minute sound healing composition using a combination of traditional and modern instruments
- Groups should consider:
  - The intention or healing goal of their composition
  - How to layer and combine different sounds
  - Creating a sense of flow or journey in the piece
- Each group performs their composition for the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion:
  - What were the most surprising discoveries about the instruments?
  - How might different instruments be suited for various healing purposes?
  - How can local Timorese instruments be integrated into sound healing practices?
- Quick quiz: Show images of instruments, students identify and state one fact about each

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research one traditional Timorese instrument not covered in class
- Write a one-page report including:
  - Description of the instrument
  - How it's traditionally used
  - Ideas for incorporating it into sound healing practices
- Optional: Record a short video demonstrating the instrument if possible

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Resonance: The reinforcement or prolongation of sound by reflection or vibration
- Vibration: A rapid back and forth motion
- Timbre: The character or quality of a musical sound distinct from its pitch and intensity
- Frequency: The number of sound wave cycles per second, determining pitch
- Harmonic: A tone produced by vibration of a string or column of air in an exact fraction of its length
- Overtone: Any frequency higher than the fundamental frequency of a sound
