## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students feeling self-conscious about making sounds
   - Tip: Start with group activities to build comfort, emphasize that there's no "right" way to make healing sounds

2. Challenge: Limited number of instruments for hands-on practice
   - Tip: Set up rotation stations, encourage students to improvise with everyday objects, use audio recordings as supplements

3. Challenge: Difficulty in connecting traditional Timorese instruments to sound healing
   - Tip: Invite a local musician or healer as a guest speaker, encourage students to share family stories or experiences

4. Challenge: Maintaining a calm atmosphere during sound explorations
   - Tip: Establish clear guidelines for respectful playing, use visual cues for volume control, incorporate silent reflection periods

5. Challenge: Students struggling with the scientific concepts of sound
   - Tip: Use simple demonstrations and analogies, focus on experiential learning rather than technical details

6. Challenge: Varying levels of musical experience among students
   - Tip: Emphasize that sound healing is about intention and presence, not musical skill. Pair more experienced students with beginners for peer support.
