## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may be skeptical about the healing power of music.
   **Solution**: Provide scientific evidence and case studies. Encourage students to keep an open mind and experience the effects firsthand through in-class activities.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to traditional Timorese instruments.
   **Solution**: Use recordings when live instruments are unavailable. Encourage students to improvise with everyday objects that can produce similar sounds.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty in creating healing playlists due to limited music knowledge.
   **Solution**: Provide a diverse selection of pre-approved songs and guide students through the selection process based on tempo, mood, and cultural relevance.

4. **Challenge**: Cultural sensitivity when discussing traditional practices.
   **Solution**: Invite a local expert or elder to speak about traditional music and healing. Emphasize respect for cultural practices throughout the lesson.

5. **Challenge**: Students may feel self-conscious about participating in vocal exercises.
   **Solution**: Start with group activities to build comfort. Emphasize that the goal is exploration, not perfection. Provide options for private practice.

6. **Challenge**: Difficulty in measuring the effects of music on healing.
   **Solution**: Introduce simple self-assessment tools like mood scales or body scans before and after listening exercises. Discuss the subjective nature of music's effects.
