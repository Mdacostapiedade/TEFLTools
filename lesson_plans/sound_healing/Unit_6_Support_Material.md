   - **Tip**: Demonstrate how to use everyday objects as sound tools. Encourage creativity in finding sound sources.

3. **Challenge**: Skepticism about the effectiveness of sound healing
   - **Tip**: Provide scientific studies and encourage students to keep an open mind. Focus on personal experience rather than making broad claims.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in feeling or noticing subtle effects of sound
   - **Tip**: Guide students through focused listening exercises. Encourage journaling to track small changes over time.

5. **Challenge**: Cultural sensitivity when introducing non-Timorese practices
   - **Tip**: Always relate new techniques to local traditions. Invite discussions on how to adapt practices to fit cultural norms.

6. **Challenge**: Managing a diverse group with varying sensitivities to sound
