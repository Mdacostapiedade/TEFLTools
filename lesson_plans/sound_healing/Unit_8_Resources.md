# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Sound Healing in a Rural Community Health Center

### Background:
The Maliana Community Health Center serves a rural population in the Bobonaro District of Timor-Leste. The center faces challenges including limited resources, high patient volume, and a prevalence of stress-related health issues among the local farming community.

### Intervention:
A pilot program was implemented to introduce sound healing techniques as a complementary therapy at the health center. The program included:
- Training for two nurses in basic sound healing techniques
- Twice-weekly group sound healing sessions for stress reduction
- Individual sound therapy sessions for patients with chronic pain
- Use of traditional Timorese instruments alongside modern sound healing tools

### Results:
After six months, the program showed promising outcomes:
- 70% of participants reported reduced stress levels
- 60% of chronic pain patients reported improved pain management
- Healthcare providers noted improved patient mood and engagement
- Increased interest from the community in both sound healing and general health services

### Challenges and Solutions:
- Initial skepticism from some staff members was addressed through education and demonstration sessions
- Limited space was resolved by conducting some sessions outdoors under a canopy
- Integration with traditional healing practices was achieved by collaborating with local healers

### Lessons Learned:
- Importance of staff buy-in and training
- Need for flexibility in adapting techniques to local context
- Value of incorporating traditional elements for cultural relevance and acceptance
