## Ibn Arabi's Life

Ibn Arabi was born in 1165 CE in Murcia, al-Andalus (modern-day Spain). He lived during a time of great intellectual and cultural exchange in the Islamic world. As a young man, he had a profound spiritual experience that set him on the path of Sufism. He traveled extensively throughout the Islamic world, studying with various masters and writing prolifically. His two most famous works are "The Meccan Revelations" and "The Seals of Wisdom." Ibn Arabi settled in Damascus in his later years, where he died in 1240 CE.

## Excerpt from Fusus al-Hikam

"Know that the universe is a single reality, but it exists in multiple forms. The forms are different, but the reality is one. Whoever understands this secret has comprehended the mystery of the Divine Unity (tawhid). The multiplicity of forms does not negate the unity of the essence, just as the multiplicity of divine names does not negate the unity of the Named."
