# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Ibn Arabi on Divine Names

"Know that the divine names are countless and without limit, for they are the relations and connections between the Real and the cosmos, and the relations are without limit. The divine names that we know and don't know are all names of a single Named One, and that Named One is the Essence."

- From "The Meccan Revelations" by Ibn Arabi

## The Parable of the Mirror

"The Real is a mirror in which you see yourself, and you are His mirror in which He sees His Names and their determinations, which are nothing other than Himself."

- From "The Bezels of Wisdom" by Ibn Arabi

# Lecture Notes

## The 99 Names of Allah in Islamic Tradition

1. Historical background
   - Rooted in Quranic verses and Hadith
   - Developed and systematized by Islamic scholars

2. Significance in Islamic theology and practice
   - Used in prayer and meditation
   - Reflect divine attributes and qualities

3. Categories of names
   - Names of Beauty (Jamal): e.g., Al-Rahman (The Compassionate), Al-Wadud (The Loving)
   - Names of Majesty (Jalal): e.g., Al-Aziz (The Mighty), Al-Jabbar (The Compeller)
   - Names of Perfection (Kamal): e.g., Al-Haqq (The Truth), Al-Nur (The Light)

## Ibn Arabi's Concept of Divine Self-Disclosure (Tajalli)

1. The relationship between Essence and Attributes
   - Essence (Dhat) as the unknowable divine reality
   - Attributes as the means by which the Essence is known

2. Process of divine self-disclosure
   - From absolute unity to multiplicity in creation
   - Levels of manifestation: divine, spiritual, imaginal, physical

3. Role of the Perfect Human (al-Insan al-Kamil)
   - Microcosm reflecting all divine attributes
   - Mediator between divine and created realms

## Ibn Arabi's Theory of Divine Names

1. Interrelationships among names
   - Names as aspects of a single reality
   - Complementary and contrasting relationships

2. Hierarchies of names
   - "Mothers of the Names" (e.g., Al-Hayy, Al-Alim, Al-Murid, Al-Qadir)
   - Derivation and dependencies among names

3. Names in cosmology and spiritual psychology
   - Each created thing as a manifestation of specific divine names
   - Human potential to actualize divine attributes

# Discussion Questions

1. How does Ibn Arabi's concept of divine self-disclosure differ from more traditional Islamic views of God's relationship to creation?

2. In what ways might the theory of divine names influence a person's spiritual practice or understanding of the world?

3. How do the categories of divine names (Beauty, Majesty, Perfection) relate to human experiences and qualities?

4. What are the potential philosophical or theological challenges in reconciling the idea of God's unity with the multiplicity of divine names?

5. How might Ibn Arabi's ideas about divine names and attributes be compared or contrasted with concepts of divinity in Timorese animism?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Writing on Divine Names

   - A personal experience or observation that relates to this divine name
   - How this attribute might be understood or expressed in Timorese culture
