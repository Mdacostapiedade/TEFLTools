## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with abstract metaphysical concepts
   - **Tip**: Use concrete examples and analogies from everyday life to illustrate abstract ideas. Encourage students to relate concepts to their personal experiences.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in understanding Arabic terminology
   - **Tip**: Create a visual glossary with Arabic terms, their transliterations, and simple definitions. Consistently use both Arabic and English terms in discussions.

3. **Challenge**: Reconciling Islamic concepts with local Timorese beliefs
   - **Tip**: Emphasize comparative analysis rather than value judgments. Encourage students to find both similarities and differences, fostering an atmosphere of mutual respect and curiosity.

4. **Challenge**: Engaging students in complex philosophical discussions
   - **Tip**: Use interactive methods like think-pair-share, small group discussions, and creative projects to make abstract concepts more engaging and relatable.

5. **Challenge**: Balancing depth of content with time constraints
   - **Tip**: Prioritize key concepts and use flipped classroom techniques, assigning preparatory readings or videos before class to maximize in-class discussion time.
