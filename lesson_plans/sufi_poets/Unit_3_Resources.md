## Excerpt from Fusus al-Hikam: On the Perfect Human

"Know that the Perfect Human is he who possesses the perfection of all cosmic and divine realities. He is for the Divine Presence as the pupil is for the eye, through which the act of seeing takes place. He is the mirror of the Real and the place of manifestation for the divine names and attributes. He is the isthmus between the world and the Real, gathering in himself both creation and truth. He is the Qur'an that separates and gathers, the word that distinguishes and unifies."

## Story of Sheikh Hamza Fansuri (Timorese Sufi)

Sheikh Hamza Fansuri was a renowned 16th-century Sufi poet from Aceh, whose influence reached Timor. It is said that he could speak with animals and control the elements. Once, when a drought threatened the crops, Sheikh Hamza stood in meditation for three days and nights. On the fourth day, rain began to fall, saving the harvest. The people saw in him a perfect balance of spiritual power and compassion, embodying divine attributes in human form.
