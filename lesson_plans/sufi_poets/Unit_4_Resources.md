## Excerpt from Fusus al-Hikam (The Seals of Wisdom) by Ibn Arabi

"Know that imagination is neither existent nor non-existent, neither known nor unknown, neither negated nor affirmed. It is the presence which comprises all the divine and cosmic realities. It is the most complete and perfect of all presences, for it is through imagination that the impossible becomes possible, the non-existent becomes existent, and the existent becomes non-existent.

The imagination is the barzakh (isthmus) between the spiritual and corporeal worlds, between the abstract and the sensory, between the intelligible and the unintelligible. It is like a mirror: the spiritual realities are reflected in it and appear as sensory forms, while the sensory forms are spiritualized in it and appear as meanings and spirits.

The one who knows the power of imagination knows the secret of existence, for the entire cosmos is nothing but imagination within imagination. The Real (al-Haqq) is the only true existence, and everything else is His imagination and His creation through imagination."
