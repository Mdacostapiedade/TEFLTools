## Ibn Arabi on Wahdat al-Wujud

"There is nothing in existence except Allah... Hence the Prophet (upon whom be peace) said, 'Glory be to Him who created things, being Himself their essence (ain).'"

"The universe is imaginary... it has no real existence. And this is the meaning of the imagination. For you just imagine that it (i.e., the universe) is an autonomous reality quite different from the Absolute Reality, while in truth it is nothing of the sort."

"He who knows himself knows his Lord... He who knows himself as both annihilated and existent at the same time knows the Lord of the worlds."

# Lecture Notes

## 1. Definition and Origins of Wahdat al-Wujud

- Wahdat al-Wujud literally means "Unity of Being" or "Unity of Existence"
- Concept developed by Ibn Arabi in the 12th-13th centuries
- Rooted in Quranic verses and hadith emphasizing God's oneness and omnipresence
- Influenced by earlier Sufi thinkers and Neo-Platonic philosophy

## 2. Key Principles

- God (Allah) is the only true existence
- Creation is a manifestation or self-disclosure of God's attributes
- The world is real as God's self-manifestation but unreal in itself
- Apparent multiplicity in creation is an illusion; underlying reality is one

## 3. Relationship to Islamic Tawhid

- Wahdat al-Wujud seen as an extension of Tawhid (Divine Unity)
- Goes beyond affirming one God to asserting one existence
- Challenges: Maintaining distinction between Creator and creation
- Ibn Arabi's approach: Combining tanzih (transcendence) and tashbih (immanence)

## 4. Metaphysical Implications

- Nature of reality: Monism vs. qualified non-dualism
- Relationship between Absolute (Haqq) and contingent (khalq)
- Levels of existence: Necessary Being vs. possible beings
- Concept of perpetual creation and renewal of the cosmos

## 5. Misunderstandings and Critiques

- Accusation of pantheism or panentheism
- Concerns about negating individual responsibility
- Perceived conflict with orthodox Islamic theology
- Ibn Taymiyyah's critique and later debates
