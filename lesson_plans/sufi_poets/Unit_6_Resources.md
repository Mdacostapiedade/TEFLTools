# Excerpts and Short Stories

## From "Fusus al-Hikam" by Ibn Arabi

### On Perpetual Creation

"Know that you are an imagination, and all that you perceive and say to yourself, 'this is not me,' is also an imagination. So the entire existence is an imagination within an imagination."

"The cosmos is never for two moments the same. At every moment it disappears and is never repeated, and another creation similar to it manifests to take its place, though the onlooker is not aware of this because of the similarity of the new image to that which has passed away and ceased."

### On Time and Eternity

"Time is the succession of states upon the Essence. It is the container of events, and events are the contents of time. Time, then, is imaginary, having no existence in the external world."

"Eternity is not the negation of time, but rather its fullness. It is the ever-present 'now' in which all moments of time are simultaneously present."

## From "The Meccan Revelations" by Ibn Arabi

### On the Barzakh

"The barzakh is that which separates two things while never completely becoming either of them. Like the line that separates shadow from light, or the isthmus between two seas, it is neither one nor the other, yet contains properties of both."

### On Eschatology

"The afterlife is not a place we go to, but a state we realize. It is the unveiling of realities that have always been present but hidden from our perception."

# Lecture Notes

## Ibn Arabi's Concept of Time

1. Perpetual Creation (al-khalq al-jadid)
   - The universe is continuously being renewed at every moment
   - No two moments are identical; each is a new creation
   - This concept is rooted in the Quranic verse: "They are in confusion about the new creation" (50:15)

2. Relationship to Divine Names
   - Each moment is a manifestation of divine attributes
   - The name "Al-Khaliq" (The Creator) is constantly active
   - Time as a succession of divine self-disclosures (tajalli)

3. Implications for Human Perception
   - Our experience of continuity is an illusion
   - The apparent stability of the world masks its constant renewal
   - Awareness of perpetual creation can lead to spiritual awakening

## Levels of Time in Ibn Arabi's Cosmology

1. Divine Time
   - Timelessness or "dahr" - the eternal present
   - All moments exist simultaneously in divine knowledge

2. Cosmic Time
   - The succession of celestial movements
   - Measured by the rotation of celestial spheres

3. Human Time
   - Subjective experience of duration
   - Influenced by states of consciousness and spiritual development

4. Interaction of Time Levels
   - Human time is nested within cosmic time
   - Cosmic time is a manifestation of divine time
   - Spiritual practices can allow access to higher levels of time

## Sufi Interpretations of Quranic Eschatology

1. Spiritual Hermeneutics
   - Reading Quranic descriptions of afterlife symbolically
   - Paradise and Hell as states of consciousness rather than physical locations

2. The Imaginal World (alam al-mithal)
   - An intermediate realm between the physical and spiritual
   - Where abstract realities take on concrete forms
   - The realm of dreams, visions, and post-mortem experiences

3. Resurrection as Spiritual Realization
   - Physical resurrection understood as a metaphor for spiritual awakening
   - The "Day of Judgment" as an ongoing process of self-evaluation

4. Eternity and the Nature of the Soul
   - The soul as eternal and pre-existent
   - Physical death as a transition rather than an end
   - The afterlife as a continuation of the soul's journey towards perfection

# Discussion Questions

1. How does Ibn Arabi's concept of perpetual creation challenge our conventional understanding of time and change?

2. In what ways might the idea of multiple levels of time (divine, cosmic, human) affect our approach to daily life and spiritual practice?

4. Can you think of any parallels between Ibn Arabi's ideas about time and eternity and concepts from Timorese spiritual traditions?

5. How might the concept of the barzakh (isthmus) be applied to understanding the relationship between the physical and spiritual aspects of our lives?

6. In what ways does Ibn Arabi's understanding of time and eternity challenge or complement modern scientific views of time?

7. How might the idea of "perpetual creation" influence our understanding of free will and personal responsibility?
