# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Sustainable Local Architecture

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts with key vocabulary and concepts
- Photos of traditional Timorese buildings and modern sustainable architecture
- Materials for group activity (large paper, markers, tape)
- Transportation for field trip

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define sustainable architecture and its key principles
- Explain the importance of using local materials and techniques in building
- Identify key features of Timor-Leste's architectural heritage
- Compare local and global building practices

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show images of various buildings (both traditional Timorese and modern international)
- Ask students to categorize them as "local" or "global" and explain their reasoning
- Discuss the differences they observe between local and global architecture

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Sustainability
- Vernacular architecture
- Local materials
- Carbon footprint
- Cultural identity in architecture

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### 5.1 Principles of Sustainable Architecture
- Definition and importance
- Key elements: energy efficiency, use of local materials, minimal environmental impact

### 5.2 Local vs. Global Building Practices
- Advantages and challenges of local building practices
- Impact of globalization on architecture
- Case studies comparing local and imported building materials

### 5.3 Timor-Leste's Architectural Heritage
- Overview of traditional Timorese building styles
- Cultural significance of architectural elements
- Challenges in preserving traditional architecture

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

### 6.1 Group Discussion
- Divide class into small groups
- Assign each group a topic: sustainability, local materials, or cultural identity
- Groups discuss how their topic relates to architecture in Timor-Leste
- Each group presents their findings to the class

### 6.2 Material Identification Exercise
- Show samples or images of local and imported building materials
- Students identify each material and discuss its sustainability and cultural relevance

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

### 7.1 Design Concept Sketch
- Students work in pairs to sketch a concept for a small building (e.g., community center)
- Design must incorporate sustainable principles and local materials
- Students present their sketches, explaining their design choices

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Preview the upcoming field trip to observe traditional Timorese buildings

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 500-word essay on one aspect of traditional Timorese architecture
- Prepare questions for the upcoming field trip and interviews with local builders

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Sustainability: Meeting present needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs
- Vernacular architecture: Building style using local materials and traditions, specific to a particular region
- Local materials: Building materials sourced from the immediate area or region
- Carbon footprint: Total amount of greenhouse gases produced by human activities
- Cultural identity in architecture: Architectural elements that reflect and preserve a society's cultural heritage
