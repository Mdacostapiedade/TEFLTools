Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Introduction to Sustainable Local Architecture, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Introduction to Sustainable Local Architecture

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Sustainability**: Meeting present needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs
- **Vernacular architecture**: Building style using local materials and traditions, specific to a particular region
- **Local materials**: Building materials sourced from the immediate area or region
- **Carbon footprint**: Total amount of greenhouse gases produced by human activities
- **Cultural identity in architecture**: Architectural elements that reflect and preserve a society's cultural heritage
- **Passive design**: Architectural approach that uses building layout, materials, and natural elements to reduce energy consumption
- **Thermal mass**: Materials' capacity to absorb, store, and release heat
- **Bioclimatic design**: Architectural approach that considers local climate conditions to maximize comfort and minimize energy use
- **Embodied energy**: Total energy required for the production, transport, and installation of a building material

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Comparison Chart: Local vs. Global Architecture**
   - A side-by-side comparison showing:
     - Local materials (e.g., bamboo, thatch, earth) vs. Global materials (e.g., concrete, steel, glass)
     - Traditional Timorese house design vs. Modern international style building
     - Local climate adaptation features vs. Energy-intensive climate control systems

2. **Sustainable Architecture Principles Diagram**
   - A circular diagram illustrating the interconnected principles of sustainable architecture:
     - Energy efficiency
     - Use of local materials
     - Minimal environmental impact
     - Cultural preservation
     - Community engagement
     - Climate responsiveness

3. **Timor-Leste Architectural Heritage Timeline**
   - A visual timeline showing the evolution of Timorese architecture from traditional to contemporary styles, highlighting key cultural influences and historical events

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Sustainable Architecture Checklist**
   - A list of criteria for students to evaluate building designs:
     - Use of local materials
     - Energy efficiency features
     - Cultural relevance
     - Climate responsiveness
     - Community involvement in design

2. **Local Materials Identification Worksheet**
   - Images of various local and imported building materials
   - Students identify each material, its properties, and potential uses in sustainable architecture

3. **Design Concept Sketch Template**
   - A template for students to use during the production task, including:
     - Space for sketching
     - Prompts for explaining sustainable features
     - Checklist of local materials incorporated
     - Section for describing cultural elements

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Sustainable Architecture in Timor-Leste: Bridging Tradition and Innovation" by [Local Author]
2. Online course: "Introduction to Bioclimatic Design in Tropical Climates" (edX or Coursera)
3. Video series: "Traditional Building Techniques of Southeast Asia" (YouTube educational channel)
4. Website: Sustainable Building Materials Database for Southeast Asia
5. Mobile app: "Eco-Materials Calculator" for comparing environmental impact of building materials

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited exposure to traditional Timorese architecture.
   **Solution**: Organize a field trip or virtual tour of traditional buildings before the lesson. Use plenty of visual aids and invite local experts as guest speakers.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in understanding the technical aspects of sustainable design.
   **Solution**: Use simple analogies and hands-on demonstrations. For example, demonstrate thermal mass using water bottles in sunlight.

3. **Challenge**: Students may favor "modern" global designs over local styles.
   **Solution**: Highlight successful contemporary projects that incorporate local elements. Discuss the long-term benefits of sustainable local architecture.

4. **Challenge**: Limited access to samples of local building materials.
   **Solution**: Create a class "material library" over time. Encourage students to bring in samples they find. Use high-quality images when physical samples are unavailable.

5. **Challenge**: Varying levels of drawing skills for the design concept sketch.
   **Solution**: Emphasize that the focus is on ideas, not artistic skill. Provide simple templates or allow digital sketching tools for those who prefer them.
