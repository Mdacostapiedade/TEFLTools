# Lesson Plan: Local Materials and Their Properties

## 1. Resources Needed

- Samples of local building materials (bamboo, earth, palm fronds, etc.)
- Testing equipment (scales, moisture meters, strength testing apparatus)
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on material properties
- Safety equipment (gloves, goggles) for material handling

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify at least 5 local building materials available in Timor-Leste
- Describe the key properties of these materials
- Explain how these properties affect their use in construction
- Conduct basic tests to determine material strength and durability

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- "Material Mystery Box": Pass around boxes containing different local materials. Students feel the materials without looking and try to identify them, discussing their potential uses in construction.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

- Introduce and define key terms: tensile strength, compressive strength, thermal mass, moisture content, biodegradability
- Use visual aids and simple demonstrations to illustrate these concepts

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of local materials available in Timor-Leste (bamboo, earth, palm, stone, etc.)
- Detailed exploration of each material's properties:
  - Physical characteristics
  - Structural capabilities
  - Durability and lifespan
  - Environmental impact
  - Cultural significance
- Sustainable harvesting and processing methods for each material

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

- Material testing workshop:
  - Divide class into groups, each assigned a different material
  - Demonstrate proper testing procedures for strength, moisture content, etc.
  - Students conduct tests and record results
  - Groups share findings with the class

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- "Material Matchmaker": Students create posters matching local materials to appropriate building applications based on their properties
- Present and justify choices to the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick quiz on material properties and uses
- Class discussion: Advantages and challenges of using local materials in modern construction

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 2-page report on a traditional Timorese building technique using one of the local materials discussed in class
- Include information on the material's properties, how it's traditionally used, and potential ways to improve its application

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Tensile strength: The maximum stress a material can withstand while being stretched before breaking
- Compressive strength: The capacity of a material to withstand loads tending to reduce size
- Thermal mass: The ability of a material to absorb, store, and release heat
- Moisture content: The quantity of water contained in a material
- Biodegradability: The ability of a material to decompose naturally by biological processes
