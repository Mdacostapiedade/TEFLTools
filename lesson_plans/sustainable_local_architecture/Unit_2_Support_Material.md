Here's the support material for the lesson on Local Materials and Their Properties, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Local Materials and Their Properties Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Tensile strength**: The maximum stress a material can withstand while being stretched before breaking
- **Compressive strength**: The capacity of a material to withstand loads tending to reduce size
- **Thermal mass**: The ability of a material to absorb, store, and release heat
- **Moisture content**: The quantity of water contained in a material
- **Biodegradability**: The ability of a material to decompose naturally by biological processes
- **Sustainability**: The ability to maintain ecological balance without depleting natural resources
- **Indigenous materials**: Building materials naturally occurring or traditionally produced in a specific region
- **Structural integrity**: The ability of a structure to withstand its intended loads without failure
- **Weathering**: The breaking down or dissolution of materials due to exposure to environmental factors
- **Embodied energy**: The total energy required for the extraction, processing, manufacture, and delivery of building materials

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Material Properties Comparison Chart**: A bar graph comparing tensile strength, compressive strength, and thermal mass of bamboo, earth, palm fronds, and local stone.

2. **Sustainable Building Material Cycle**: A circular diagram showing the lifecycle of local materials from harvesting to construction to biodegradation/recycling.

3. **Traditional Timorese House Cross-Section**: Labeled diagram showing the use of different local materials in various parts of a traditional house.

4. **Material Testing Procedures**: Step-by-step illustrations for conducting basic strength and moisture content tests on local materials.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Local Material Identification Sheet**: 
   - Images of 10 local building materials
   - Space for students to write the material name, key properties, and common uses

2. **Material Properties Data Collection Form**:
   - Tables for recording test results (strength, moisture content, weight)
   - Space for observations on texture, appearance, and workability

3. **Material-Application Matching Exercise**:
   - List of building applications (e.g., roofing, walls, foundations)
   - List of local materials
   - Students draw lines to match appropriate materials to applications

4. **Sustainable Harvesting Guidelines**:
   - Checklist of best practices for sustainably harvesting each local material
   - Questions for students to research and answer about local harvesting methods

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Traditional Architecture of Timor-Leste" by Cinatti, Almeida, and Mendes
2. "Bamboo: The Gift of the Gods" by Oscar Hidalgo-Lopez
3. "Building with Earth: Design and Technology of a Sustainable Architecture" by Gernot Minke
4. Online course: "Sustainable Materials in Building Construction" on edX
5. Video series: "Traditional Building Techniques of Southeast Asia" on YouTube
6. Local resource: Timor-Leste Bamboo Institute (contact information and website)

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language barriers**: 
   - Prepare key terms in both English and Tetum
   - Use visual aids and hands-on demonstrations to reinforce concepts

2. **Limited access to testing equipment**:
   - Develop simple, low-tech alternatives for material testing
   - Partner with local construction firms or universities to borrow equipment

3. **Varying levels of prior knowledge**:
   - Conduct a pre-lesson survey to assess students' familiarity with materials
   - Prepare additional activities for advanced students

4. **Cultural sensitivities around traditional practices**:
   - Invite local elders or craftspeople to share their knowledge
   - Emphasize the value of traditional techniques while exploring improvements

5. **Difficulty in obtaining material samples**:
   - Develop a network of local suppliers and craftspeople
   - Organize field trips to construction sites or forests for material collection

6. **Safety concerns during material handling**:
   - Provide clear safety guidelines and proper equipment
   - Demonstrate safe handling techniques before student activities

7. **Misconceptions about the durability of local materials**:
   - Present case studies of successful long-standing local material constructions
   - Discuss how proper treatment and construction techniques enhance durability
