## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barrier:
   - Challenge: Students may struggle with Tetum architectural terms.
   - Solution: Provide a comprehensive glossary and use visual aids to reinforce vocabulary.

2. Limited Access to Materials:
   - Challenge: Obtaining traditional building materials for hands-on activities.
   - Solution: Partner with local communities or cultural centers to source materials. Consider using scaled-down models if full-size materials are unavailable.

3. Elder Availability:
   - Challenge: Difficulty in arranging elder interviews for all student groups.
   - Solution: Consider inviting elders to the classroom for a panel discussion as an alternative. Prepare video interviews as backup.

4. Cultural Sensitivity:
   - Challenge: Ensuring respect for sacred architectural elements and practices.
   - Solution: Discuss the importance of cultural respect before field trips or guest speaker sessions. Provide guidelines on appropriate behavior and questions.

5. Varying Skill Levels:
   - Challenge: Students may have different levels of familiarity with construction techniques.
   - Solution: Use peer teaching, pairing more experienced students with beginners. Provide extra support materials for those who need additional practice.

6. Time Management:
   - Challenge: Hands-on activities may take longer than expected.
   - Solution: Have additional short activities prepared to engage faster-working students. Be flexible with the schedule and prioritize key learning objectives.
