# Lesson Plan: Improving Local Techniques

## 1. Resources Needed

- Samples of local building materials (earth, bamboo, etc.)
- Damp-proofing materials (PE foil, bitumen)
- Simple formwork for earth construction
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on traditional vs. improved building techniques
- Safety equipment (gloves, goggles) for hands-on activities

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify areas for improvement in traditional Timorese building techniques
- Explain methods for enhancing durability and comfort in local structures
- Apply basic improvements to foundation, structural, and ventilation systems

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show images of traditional Timorese buildings with visible issues (e.g., damp walls, poor ventilation)
- Ask students to identify and discuss potential problems in small groups

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Damp-proofing
- Structural reinforcement
- Thermal comfort
- Natural ventilation
- Earth stabilization

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### 5.1 Foundations and Damp-proofing
- Traditional vs. improved foundation techniques
- Introduction to damp-proof courses and their importance

### 5.2 Structural Reinforcement
- Methods for reinforcing earth walls (e.g., adding straw, bamboo reinforcement)
- Improved joinery techniques for bamboo structures

### 5.3 Natural Ventilation and Thermal Comfort
- Principles of cross-ventilation
- Roof design for improved air circulation and heat reduction

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### 6.1 Damp-proofing Experiment
- Students create small earth blocks with and without damp-proof courses
- Observe water absorption differences

### 6.2 Structural Analysis
- In groups, analyze diagrams of traditional structures
- Propose and sketch reinforcement improvements

## 7. Production Task (30 minutes)

### Design Challenge
- Students work in pairs to redesign a traditional Timorese house
- Focus on incorporating at least three improvements learned in the lesson
- Prepare a brief presentation explaining their improvements

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Groups present their improved designs
- Class discussion on the most effective improvements
- Quick quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and document three examples of improved traditional buildings in other tropical countries
- Write a short report (500 words) comparing these improvements to Timorese techniques

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Damp-proofing: Techniques used to prevent moisture from passing into a building structure
- Structural reinforcement: Methods to increase the strength and stability of a building
- Thermal comfort: The condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment
- Natural ventilation: The process of supplying and removing air through a space without mechanical systems
- Earth stabilization: The process of improving the physical properties of soil to enhance its building performance
