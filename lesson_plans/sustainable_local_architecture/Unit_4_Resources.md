# Lecture Notes

## Foundations and Damp-proofing

### Traditional Foundation Techniques
- Shallow foundations common in traditional Timorese architecture
- Often consist of compacted earth or loose stone
- Vulnerable to moisture penetration and erosion

### Improved Foundation Techniques
- Deeper foundations (at least 50cm below ground level)
- Use of concrete or stabilized earth blocks for foundation walls
- Incorporation of proper drainage systems around the foundation

### Damp-proof Courses (DPC)
- Definition: A horizontal barrier in a wall designed to prevent moisture rising through the structure
- Materials: Polyethylene sheets, bitumen-based materials, or slate
- Installation: Placed between the foundation and the wall structure
- Benefits: Prevents rising damp, protects wall materials, improves indoor air quality

## Structural Reinforcement

### Earth Wall Reinforcement
- Addition of natural fibers (straw, sisal) to earth mixtures
- Increases tensile strength and reduces cracking
- Optimal fiber length: 3-5cm
- Fiber content: 1-3% by volume

### Bamboo Reinforcement Techniques
- Use of bamboo as internal reinforcement in earth walls
- Vertical bamboo poles at corners and openings
- Horizontal bamboo ties at regular intervals
- Treatment of bamboo with borax solution to prevent insect infestation

### Improved Joinery for Bamboo Structures
- Fish-mouth joints for stronger connections
- Use of natural fiber lashing combined with wooden pegs
- Application of modern fasteners (bolts, steel plates) for critical joints

## Natural Ventilation and Thermal Comfort

### Principles of Cross-Ventilation
- Placement of openings on opposite or adjacent walls
- Consideration of prevailing wind directions
- Use of adjustable openings for airflow control

### Improved Roof Design
- Increased roof height for better stack effect ventilation
- Use of vented ridges to allow hot air escape
- Implementation of wide eaves for shading and rain protection

### Thermal Mass for Temperature Regulation
- Use of thick earth walls to absorb heat during the day and release it at night
- Incorporation of internal courtyards for microclimate control
- Strategic placement of vegetation for natural cooling

# Discussion Questions

1. How can traditional Timorese building techniques be adapted to improve resilience against climate change impacts?

2. What are the potential challenges in introducing new damp-proofing techniques to rural communities, and how might these be overcome?

3. Discuss the balance between preserving traditional architectural aesthetics and implementing structural reinforcements. How can we achieve both goals?

4. Compare and contrast the effectiveness of natural ventilation techniques in different regions of Timor-Leste. How might solutions vary between coastal and mountainous areas?

5. What role can local materials play in improving the thermal comfort of buildings? Provide specific examples relevant to Timor-Leste.

6. How might improved building techniques impact the social and economic aspects of Timorese communities?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Analyze the potential impact of improved local building techniques on the sustainability and resilience of rural Timorese communities. Consider environmental, social, and economic factors in your discussion."

Your essay should include:
- An introduction outlining the current state of rural Timorese architecture
- At least three specific examples of improved building techniques
- A discussion of the potential benefits and challenges of implementing these techniques
- A conclusion summarizing the overall impact and suggesting future directions

Use proper citations for any external sources consulted.

# Assignment Details

## Design Challenge: Improve a Traditional Structure

1. Choose a traditional Timorese building type (e.g., Uma Lulik, rural home, community center)

2. Create a detailed analysis of the existing structure, including:
   - Materials used
   - Construction techniques
   - Identified weaknesses or areas for improvement

3. Develop a redesign proposal that incorporates at least five improvements from the topics covered this week. Your proposal should include:
   - Detailed sketches or CAD drawings of the improved structure
   - Material specifications
   - Construction process outline
   - Explanation of how each improvement addresses a specific issue

4. Prepare a 10-minute presentation of your redesign, including:
   - Brief overview of the original structure
   - Detailed explanation of proposed improvements
   - Discussion of potential challenges in implementation
   - Cost-benefit analysis of the improvements

5. Submit a written report (1500-2000 words) documenting your design process, research, and final proposal.
