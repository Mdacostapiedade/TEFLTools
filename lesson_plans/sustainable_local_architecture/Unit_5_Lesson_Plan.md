# Lesson Plan: Integrating Modern Sustainable Technologies

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on solar power basics and rainwater harvesting systems
- Sample solar panels, batteries, and inverters for demonstration
- Materials for solar system design activity (graph paper, rulers, colored pencils)
- Field trip transportation

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the basics of solar power systems and their applicability in rural Timor-Leste
- Design a small-scale solar system for a rural home
- Describe the principles of rainwater harvesting and ecological sanitation
- Identify successful examples of sustainable technology integration in local architecture

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students match sustainable technologies with their benefits
- Group discussion: What sustainable technologies have students seen in their communities?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms: photovoltaic, inverter, greywater, composting toilet
- Students create visual flashcards for each term

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

- Lecture on solar power basics:
  - How photovoltaic cells work
  - Components of a solar power system
  - Advantages and challenges in rural Timor-Leste
- Presentation on rainwater harvesting:
  - System components and design principles
  - Benefits for water conservation
- Introduction to ecological sanitation:
  - Composting toilets and greywater systems
  - Environmental and health benefits

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Small group activity: Identify potential applications for solar power in a rural Timorese village
- Pair work: Sketch a basic rainwater harvesting system for a traditional Timorese home

## 7. Production Task (60 minutes)

- Individual project: Design a small-scale solar system for a rural home
  - Students use provided materials to create a detailed plan
  - Include system components, placement, and estimated power output

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Gallery walk: Students present their solar system designs
- Class discussion: Challenges and opportunities for integrating these technologies in Timor-Leste

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a one-page report on a successful sustainable technology project in Southeast Asia
- Prepare questions for the upcoming field trip

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Photovoltaic: Capable of producing voltage when exposed to radiant energy, especially light
- Inverter: A device that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC)
- Greywater: Wastewater from household uses like laundry and bathing, excluding toilet waste
- Composting toilet: A dry toilet that uses a predominantly aerobic processing system to treat human excreta
- Rainwater harvesting: The accumulation and storage of rainwater for reuse on-site
- Ecological sanitation: A system that turns human excreta into nutrients to be returned to the soil
