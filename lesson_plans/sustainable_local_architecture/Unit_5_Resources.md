# Lecture Notes

## Solar Power Basics

### How Photovoltaic Cells Work
- Photovoltaic (PV) effect: direct conversion of light into electricity
- Silicon-based cells most common
- Electrons excited by photons create electric current
- Multiple cells connected to form panels

### Components of a Solar Power System
1. Solar panels
2. Charge controller
3. Battery bank
4. Inverter
5. Wiring and mounting equipment

### Advantages in Rural Timor-Leste
- Abundant sunlight
- Off-grid power solution
- Low maintenance
- Long-term cost savings

### Challenges in Rural Timor-Leste
- Initial cost
- Limited technical expertise for maintenance
- Dust and debris affecting efficiency
- Proper battery disposal

## Rainwater Harvesting

### System Components
1. Catchment area (usually roof)
2. Gutters and downspouts
3. First flush diverter
4. Storage tank
5. Filtration system
6. Distribution system (pump or gravity-fed)

### Design Principles
- Maximize catchment area
- Ensure proper slope for gutters
- Size storage tank based on rainfall patterns and water needs
- Include overflow and ventilation

### Benefits for Water Conservation
- Reduces demand on groundwater
- Provides water during dry seasons
- Improves water quality (softer water)
- Reduces soil erosion and flooding

## Ecological Sanitation

### Composting Toilets
- Separate liquid and solid waste
- Aerobic decomposition of solid waste
- Addition of carbon-rich materials (sawdust, leaves)
- Produces safe, nutrient-rich compost

### Greywater Systems
- Separate from blackwater (toilet waste)
- Simple filtration and treatment
- Used for irrigation or groundwater recharge

### Environmental and Health Benefits
- Water conservation
- Nutrient recycling
- Reduced groundwater contamination
- Improved sanitation in areas without sewage systems

# Discussion Questions

1. How might the introduction of solar power systems impact daily life in rural Timorese villages?
2. What cultural considerations should be taken into account when implementing rainwater harvesting systems in traditional Timorese homes?
3. How can we address potential resistance to ecological sanitation methods in communities accustomed to conventional toilets?
4. In what ways can these sustainable technologies be integrated with traditional Timorese building practices?
5. What are the potential economic impacts of widespread adoption of these technologies in Timor-Leste?
6. How might climate change affect the effectiveness of these sustainable technologies in Timor-Leste?
7. What role should the government play in promoting and supporting the integration of these technologies?
8. How can we ensure that the implementation of these technologies is equitable and accessible to all communities in Timor-Leste?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on the following topic:

"Imagine you are tasked with implementing a sustainable technology project in a rural Timorese village. Choose one of the technologies discussed in class (solar power, rainwater harvesting, or ecological sanitation) and describe your approach to introducing and integrating this technology into the community. Consider cultural, economic, and practical factors in your plan."

Your essay should include:
- An introduction explaining your chosen technology and its relevance to the community
- A description of the specific system or method you would implement
- A discussion of potential challenges and how you would address them
- An explanation of how you would involve the community in the project
- A conclusion summarizing the expected benefits and long-term impact

# Assignment Details

## Solar System Design Project

Design a small-scale solar power system for a rural Timorese home. Your design should include:

1. A detailed diagram of the system layout, including:
   - Solar panel placement
   - Battery bank location
   - Inverter and charge controller placement
   - Wiring routes

2. System specifications:
   - Number and type of solar panels
   - Battery capacity
   - Inverter size
   - Estimated daily power output

3. A list of major components with brief descriptions of their functions

4. A short explanation (200-300 words) of why you chose this particular design and how it addresses the specific needs of a rural Timorese home

5. A basic cost estimate for the system components

Submit your design as a single PDF document, including the diagram, specifications, component list, explanation, and cost estimate.

## Case Study: Solar Power in Atauro Island, Timor-Leste

In 2016, a project implemented by the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) brought solar power to the remote island of Atauro. The project installed a 10kW solar PV mini-grid system in the village of Biqueli, providing electricity to 60 households and several community buildings.

Key points:
- System design: 40 solar panels, battery bank, and smart meters for each household
- Community involvement: Local technicians trained for maintenance
- Impact: Improved lighting, education opportunities, and small business development
- Challenges: Initial skepticism, need for ongoing technical support

This case study demonstrates the potential for solar power to transform rural communities in Timor-Leste and provides valuable lessons for future projects.

## Rainwater Harvesting Calculation Example

For a typical rural Timorese home with a roof area of 50 square meters:

1. Average annual rainfall in Timor-Leste: 1,500 mm
2. Catchment area: 50 m²
3. Runoff coefficient (for metal roof): 0.9

Annual water harvesting potential:
50 m² × 1.5 m × 0.9 = 67.5 m³ or 67,500 liters

This example illustrates the significant amount of water that can be harvested from even a modest roof area, highlighting the potential impact of rainwater harvesting systems in water-scarce regions of Timor-Leste.
