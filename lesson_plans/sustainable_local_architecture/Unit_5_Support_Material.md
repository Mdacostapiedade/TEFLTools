# Support Material for Integrating Modern Sustainable Technologies Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Photovoltaic: Capable of producing voltage when exposed to radiant energy, especially light
- Solar panel: A panel designed to absorb the sun's rays as a source of energy for generating electricity
- Inverter: A device that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC)
- Battery bank: A group of batteries connected together to store electrical energy
- Greywater: Wastewater from household uses like laundry and bathing, excluding toilet waste
- Blackwater: Wastewater containing fecal matter and urine
- Composting toilet: A dry toilet that uses a predominantly aerobic processing system to treat human excreta
- Rainwater harvesting: The accumulation and storage of rainwater for reuse on-site
- Ecological sanitation: A system that turns human excreta into nutrients to be returned to the soil
- Sustainable technology: Technology that meets present needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Limited prior knowledge of electrical systems
   - Tip: Start with very basic concepts and use plenty of visual aids. Consider bringing in simple electrical kits for hands-on learning.

2. Challenge: Cultural resistance to composting toilets
   - Tip: Address cultural concerns openly and respectfully. Provide examples of successful implementations in similar cultures.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in sourcing materials for demonstrations
   - Tip: Reach out to local solar companies or NGOs for potential donations or loans of equipment. Use online simulations if physical materials are unavailable.

4. Challenge: Varying levels of math skills for system calculations
   - Tip: Provide calculators and step-by-step guides. Consider grouping students with mixed ability levels for peer support.

5. Challenge: Limited examples of sustainable technology in students' communities
   - Tip: Use case studies from similar contexts in other countries. Encourage students to imagine and design solutions for their own communities.

6. Challenge: Connecting theoretical knowledge to practical application
   - Tip: Incorporate as many hands-on activities as possible. If feasible, arrange for students to participate in a real installation project.
