## Introduction to Participatory Design

### Definition and Importance
- Participatory design is an approach that involves all stakeholders (e.g. employees, partners, customers, citizens, end-users) in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable.
- It originated in Scandinavia in the 1970s and has since spread globally.
- Importance:
  - Ensures designs meet actual user needs
  - Increases community buy-in and ownership
  - Leads to more sustainable and culturally appropriate solutions
  - Empowers local communities

### Benefits for Communities and Architects
- For communities:
  - Voice in shaping their environment
  - Development of local skills and knowledge
  - Increased social cohesion
  - Greater satisfaction with final results
- For architects:
  - Better understanding of local context and needs
  - Access to local knowledge and expertise
  - Improved project outcomes and sustainability
  - Enhanced professional reputation

## Participatory Design Techniques

### Community Mapping
- Definition: A visual method for collecting and representing information about a community's physical and social environment.
- Process:
  1. Gather community members
  2. Provide large paper or digital mapping tool
  3. Ask participants to draw their community, highlighting important features
  4. Discuss and analyze the resulting map
- Benefits:
  - Reveals local knowledge and priorities
  - Identifies resources and challenges
  - Facilitates discussion and consensus-building

### Design Charrettes
- Definition: An intensive, multi-day session where designers and community members collaborate on a design project.
- Process:
  1. Set clear goals and timeline
  2. Gather diverse stakeholders
  3. Alternate between large group discussions and smaller working groups
  4. Produce tangible design outcomes
- Benefits:
  - Rapid generation of ideas
  - Builds consensus through intensive collaboration
  - Produces actionable results in a short time frame

### Photovoice
- Definition: A process where people use photography and stories to identify and represent their community's strengths and concerns.
- Process:
  1. Provide cameras to community members
  2. Ask them to photograph their environment based on specific prompts
  3. Gather to discuss and analyze the photos
  4. Use insights to inform design decisions
- Benefits:
  - Empowers community members to document their own reality
  - Provides visual evidence of community needs and assets
  - Engages those who might not participate in traditional meetings

### Participatory 3D Modeling
- Definition: A community-based mapping method that integrates local spatial knowledge with data on elevation and land use.
- Process:
  1. Create a blank 3D model of the area
  2. Community members add features using pushpins, yarn, and paint
  3. Discuss and refine the model
  4. Use the model for planning and decision-making
- Benefits:
  - Provides a tangible, interactive representation of the area
  - Facilitates spatial thinking and planning
  - Bridges gaps between technical and local knowledge

## Facilitating Community Workshops

### Active Listening Skills
- Give full attention to the speaker
- Use non-verbal cues to show engagement (eye contact, nodding)
- Paraphrase to ensure understanding
- Ask clarifying questions
- Avoid interrupting or jumping to conclusions

### Managing Group Dynamics
- Establish clear ground rules at the start
- Encourage equal participation
- Manage dominant personalities tactfully
- Use small group breakouts for more in-depth discussions
- Be aware of cultural norms and power dynamics

### Conflict Resolution Strategies
- Acknowledge the conflict openly
- Focus on interests, not positions
- Use "I" statements to express concerns
- Look for common ground
- Brainstorm multiple solutions
- Seek win-win outcomes

## Creating a Community Engagement Plan

### Identifying Stakeholders
- Map out all potential stakeholders
- Consider direct and indirect impacts
- Include marginalized or underrepresented groups
- Analyze stakeholder interests and influence

### Setting Clear Objectives
- Define what you want to achieve through engagement
- Make objectives SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Align objectives with overall project goals

### Choosing Appropriate Engagement Methods
- Consider community preferences and cultural norms
- Match methods to objectives and stakeholder needs
- Use a mix of techniques for broader engagement
- Plan for both in-person and remote participation options

### Timeline and Resource Allocation
- Create a detailed timeline for engagement activities
- Allocate budget for materials, venues, and facilitators
- Plan for human resources needed (staff, volunteers)
- Include time for analysis and incorporation of feedback

# Discussion Questions

1. How does participatory design differ from traditional architectural design processes? What are the potential challenges and benefits of this approach?

2. In what ways can community mapping reveal information that might not be apparent through other forms of data collection?

3. How might the role of the architect change when employing participatory design methods? What new skills might be required?

4. Discuss potential power dynamics that could arise during community engagement processes. How can facilitators address these to ensure equitable participation?

5. How can participatory design techniques be adapted for use in different cultural contexts, particularly in Timor-Leste?

6. What are some potential limitations or drawbacks of participatory design? How might these be mitigated?

7. How can technology be leveraged to enhance participatory design processes, especially in rural or remote areas?

8. Discuss the ethical considerations involved in community engagement and participatory design. How can architects ensure they are acting responsibly and respectfully?

9. How might participatory design processes need to be adapted for different types of projects (e.g., housing, public spaces, infrastructure)?

10. In what ways can participatory design contribute to the long-term sustainability and resilience of architectural projects?

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Participatory Design in Rebuilding After Disaster

### Background
In 2006, a devastating earthquake struck Yogyakarta, Indonesia, destroying many homes and buildings. The reconstruction effort that followed provides an excellent example of participatory design in action.

### Participatory Approach
- Community-Driven Reconstruction: Instead of imposing pre-designed houses, architects and NGOs worked with local communities to develop culturally appropriate, earthquake-resistant designs.
- Skills Training: Local builders were trained in earthquake-resistant construction techniques, combining traditional methods with modern engineering principles.
- Material Choices: Communities were involved in deciding which materials to use, balancing cost, availability, and cultural preferences.

### Outcomes
- Over 15,000 homes rebuilt using participatory methods
- Increased community resilience and disaster preparedness
- Preservation and evolution of traditional building techniques
- Enhanced local capacity for sustainable construction

### Lessons for Timor-Leste
- Importance of involving communities in post-disaster reconstruction
- Potential for combining traditional and modern building methods
- Value of skills training as part of the participatory process

## Sample Community Mapping Exercise

### Objective
To create a community map of a university campus, highlighting areas for improvement.

### Materials Needed
- Large sheets of paper (A1 size)
- Colored markers
- Post-it notes
- Campus base map (optional)

### Instructions
1. Divide participants into groups of 4-5.
2. Provide each group with materials and a base map if using.
3. Ask groups to draw their campus, including:
   - Major buildings and landmarks
   - Paths and roads
   - Green spaces and gathering areas
   - Any other significant features
4. Once the basic map is complete, ask groups to identify and mark:
   - Areas they like and use frequently (green Post-its)
   - Areas they avoid or find problematic (red Post-its)
   - Areas with potential for improvement (yellow Post-its)
5. For each marked area, write a brief explanation on the Post-it.
6. After 30 minutes, have each group present their map to the class.
7. Discuss common themes and differences between maps.
8. Reflect on how this exercise could be adapted for use in a community setting in Timor-Leste.
