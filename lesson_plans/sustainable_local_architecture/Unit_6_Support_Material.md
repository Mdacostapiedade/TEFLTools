## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to understand the importance of community participation.
   **Solution**: Use real-world case studies that demonstrate both successful and unsuccessful projects, highlighting the impact of community involvement.

2. **Challenge**: Role-playing exercises may feel awkward for some students.
   **Solution**: Start with simple scenarios and gradually increase complexity. Provide clear guidelines and encourage a supportive, non-judgmental atmosphere.

3. **Challenge**: Students may have difficulty managing group dynamics in participatory exercises.
   **Solution**: Teach specific facilitation techniques and allow students to practice in low-stakes situations before the main activities.

4. **Challenge**: The concept of consensus building may be new and challenging.
   **Solution**: Introduce simple consensus-building exercises early in the course and revisit the concept throughout, gradually increasing complexity.

5. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to adapt participatory design techniques to the Timorese context.
   **Solution**: Invite guest speakers from local communities or organizations to share their experiences with participatory processes in Timor-Leste.

6. **Challenge**: Language barriers may arise when discussing community engagement in Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Provide key terms in both English and Tetum (or other local languages), and discuss the importance of working with local translators in real-world scenarios.
