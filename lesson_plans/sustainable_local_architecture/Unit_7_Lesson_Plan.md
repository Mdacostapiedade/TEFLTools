# Lesson Plan: Sustainable Project Planning and Management

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts on project lifecycle stages
- Sample project plans
- Calculators
- Local material price lists
- Imported material price lists

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the stages of a sustainable project lifecycle
- Identify key components of a project plan
- Compare costs of local vs. imported materials
- Develop a basic project plan for a small community building

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Ask each group to brainstorm and list the steps they think are involved in planning and executing a building project
- Have groups share their lists with the class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Project lifecycle
- Feasibility study
- Procurement
- Supply chain
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Sustainability metrics

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Project Lifecycle and Sustainability
- Explain the stages of a sustainable project lifecycle:
  1. Initiation
  2. Planning
  3. Design
  4. Procurement
  5. Construction
  6. Operation and Maintenance
  7. End-of-life/Recycling
- Discuss sustainability considerations at each stage

### Local Material Supply Chains
- Explain the concept of supply chains
- Discuss benefits and challenges of local material sourcing
- Present case studies of successful local material use in Timor-Leste

### Cost-benefit Analysis of Sustainable Practices
- Introduce the concept of cost-benefit analysis
- Explain how to factor in long-term sustainability benefits
- Demonstrate a simple cost comparison between local and imported materials

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### Activity 1: Project Lifecycle Analysis
- Provide students with a sample building project scenario
- Have them identify sustainability considerations for each lifecycle stage

### Activity 2: Local vs. Imported Material Cost Comparison
- Give students price lists for local and imported building materials
- Have them calculate and compare costs for a simple structure using both options

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

### Task: Develop a Project Plan
- Divide class into small groups
- Assign each group a small community building project (e.g., community center, school classroom)
- Have groups develop a basic project plan including:
  - Project scope
  - Timeline
  - Budget estimate
  - Material sourcing strategy
  - Sustainability goals

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Have each group briefly present their project plan
- Discuss common themes and challenges identified
- Recap key points of sustainable project planning and management

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 2-page report on a successful sustainable building project in Timor-Leste or a neighboring country
- Include analysis of project planning, material choices, and community impact

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Project lifecycle: The sequence of phases that a project goes through from its initiation to its completion
- Feasibility study: An assessment of the practicality and viability of a proposed project
- Procurement: The process of finding, agreeing terms, and acquiring goods, services, or works from an external source
- Supply chain: The network of all the individuals, organizations, resources, activities, and technology involved in the creation and sale of a product
- Cost-benefit analysis: A systematic process for calculating and comparing benefits and costs of a project or decision
- Sustainability metrics: Measurements used to assess the degree to which a project or practice is sustainable
