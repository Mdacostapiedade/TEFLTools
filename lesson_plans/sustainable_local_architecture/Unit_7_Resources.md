## Example: Local vs. Imported Material Cost Comparison

### Scenario: Roofing for a 100 m² community center

#### Local Material: Thatched Palm Leaves
- Material cost: $2 per m²
- Labor cost (local skilled workers): $5 per m²
- Transportation cost: $0.50 per m²
- Lifespan: 10 years with regular maintenance
- Maintenance cost: $0.50 per m² per year

Total initial cost: (2 + 5 + 0.50) × 100 m² = $750
Total 10-year cost: $750 + (0.50 × 100 × 10) = $1,250

#### Imported Material: Corrugated Metal Sheets
- Material cost: $8 per m²
- Labor cost (general workers): $3 per m²
- Transportation and import costs: $2 per m²
- Lifespan: 20 years with minimal maintenance
- Maintenance cost: $0.10 per m² per year

Total initial cost: (8 + 3 + 2) × 100 m² = $1,300
Total 10-year cost: $1,300 + (0.10 × 100 × 10) = $1,400

### Analysis Points to Consider
- Initial cost difference
- Long-term cost implications
- Environmental impact of production and transportation
- Cultural and aesthetic considerations
- Local economic impact (job creation, skill development)
- Adaptability to local climate conditions
- Potential for future recycling or reuse
