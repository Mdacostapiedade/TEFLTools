# Support Material for Sustainable Project Planning and Management Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Project lifecycle**: The sequence of phases that a project goes through from its initiation to its completion.
- **Feasibility study**: An assessment of the practicality and viability of a proposed project.
- **Procurement**: The process of finding, agreeing terms, and acquiring goods, services, or works from an external source.
- **Supply chain**: The network of all the individuals, organizations, resources, activities, and technology involved in the creation and sale of a product.
- **Cost-benefit analysis**: A systematic process for calculating and comparing benefits and costs of a project or decision.
- **Sustainability metrics**: Measurements used to assess the degree to which a project or practice is sustainable.
- **Local sourcing**: Obtaining materials or services from nearby suppliers or producers.
- **Carbon footprint**: The total amount of greenhouse gases produced directly and indirectly to support human activities.
- **Life-cycle assessment**: A technique to assess environmental impacts associated with all stages of a product's life.
- **Circular economy**: An economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Project Lifecycle Diagram**: A circular diagram showing the seven stages of a sustainable project lifecycle (Initiation, Planning, Design, Procurement, Construction, Operation and Maintenance, End-of-life/Recycling). Each stage is represented by a segment of the circle with an icon and brief description.

2. **Local vs. Global Supply Chain Comparison**: Two side-by-side flowcharts showing the steps involved in local and global supply chains. The local chain has fewer steps and shorter arrows, while the global chain is more complex with longer arrows, illustrating the difference in complexity and transportation.

3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis Matrix**: A 2x2 matrix with "Costs" and "Benefits" on one axis and "Short-term" and "Long-term" on the other. Each quadrant contains examples relevant to sustainable building projects.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Project Lifecycle Analysis Worksheet**: 
   - Table with columns for each project lifecycle stage
   - Rows for students to fill in sustainability considerations for each stage
   - Space for notes on potential challenges and solutions

2. **Material Cost Comparison Worksheet**:
   - Table listing common building materials (e.g., timber, concrete, bamboo)
   - Columns for local price, imported price, transportation cost, and total cost
   - Space for calculations and a final comparison summary

3. **Project Plan Template**:
   - Sections for project scope, timeline, budget estimate, material sourcing strategy, and sustainability goals
   - Guiding questions to help students complete each section
   - Checklist of key elements to include in the plan

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Project Management for Sustainable Development" by Gilbert Silvius and Ron Schipper
2. "Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things" by Michael Braungart and William McDonough
3. World Green Building Council website (www.worldgbc.org) - for global sustainable building practices
4. United Nations Sustainable Development Goals website (sdgs.un.org) - for aligning projects with global sustainability objectives
5. Local government resources on building regulations and sustainability initiatives in Timor-Leste

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to understand the long-term benefits of sustainable practices.
   **Solution**: Use real-world case studies and invite guest speakers from successful sustainable projects to share their experiences.

2. **Challenge**: Limited data on local material costs and availability in Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Encourage students to conduct field research and interviews with local suppliers. Create a class database of information that can be updated each year.

3. **Challenge**: Students may lack experience in project planning and management.
   **Solution**: Provide step-by-step guidance and templates. Consider pairing students with different strengths for group work.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in quantifying some sustainability benefits.
   **Solution**: Introduce concepts like ecosystem services valuation and social return on investment. Use simplified models for classroom exercises.

5. **Challenge**: Balancing traditional practices with modern sustainability concepts.
   **Solution**: Emphasize the value of both and encourage students to find innovative ways to combine traditional wisdom with contemporary sustainability principles.
