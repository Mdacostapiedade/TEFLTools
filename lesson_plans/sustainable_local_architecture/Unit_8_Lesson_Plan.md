# Lesson Plan: Final Project - Sustainable Local Architecture in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Large sheets of paper and markers for group work
- Samples of local building materials (bamboo, earth, etc.)
- Printed copies of local building codes and regulations
- Access to computers with design software (e.g., SketchUp)
- Site maps and climate data for Timor-Leste

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Analyze a site and its context in Timor-Leste for sustainable design
- Develop a conceptual design for a small community building using local materials and techniques
- Present their design ideas effectively to a panel of experts and community members

## 3. Warm-up Activity (15 minutes)

- Quick-fire brainstorming session: In small groups, students list as many local, sustainable building materials and techniques as they can in 5 minutes
- Groups share their lists, discussing any unique or innovative ideas

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Site analysis
- Vernacular architecture
- Passive design strategies
- Community engagement
- Sustainable development

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Introduction to the final project brief: Designing a small community building in Timor-Leste
- Overview of project requirements and assessment criteria
- Presentation on effective site analysis techniques
- Discussion of successful case studies in sustainable local architecture

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

- Site analysis exercise: Students work in pairs to analyze a provided site map and climate data for Timor-Leste
- Material selection activity: Groups evaluate different local materials for their suitability in the project, considering sustainability, durability, and cultural significance

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Individual work: Students begin developing their conceptual designs, focusing on:
  * Site layout and building orientation
  * Selection of appropriate local materials
  * Integration of passive design strategies
  * Incorporation of cultural elements
- Peer feedback session: Students present their initial ideas to a partner for constructive criticism

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion on challenges encountered and innovative solutions found
- Quick recap of key sustainable design principles for Timor-Leste
- Reminder of project timeline and upcoming milestones

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Complete a detailed site analysis report for the chosen location
- Develop initial sketches and a concept statement for the community building design
- Research and document at least three traditional Timorese building techniques to potentially incorporate into the design

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Site analysis: The process of evaluating a location's physical and environmental characteristics to inform design decisions
- Vernacular architecture: Building styles that use local materials and traditions, designed to reflect the environmental, cultural, and historical context of an area
- Passive design strategies: Architectural techniques that take advantage of natural climate to maintain comfortable conditions without mechanical systems
- Community engagement: The process of working collaboratively with community members to ensure the project meets local needs and respects cultural values
- Sustainable development: Development that meets present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
