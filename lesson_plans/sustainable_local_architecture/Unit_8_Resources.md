# Lecture Notes

## Site Analysis for Sustainable Design in Timor-Leste

### Climate Considerations
- Tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons
- High temperatures and humidity year-round
- Monsoon winds and potential for cyclones

### Topography and Landscape
- Mountainous terrain in many areas
- Coastal regions with varying soil conditions
- Importance of erosion control and flood mitigation

### Cultural and Social Factors
- Traditional settlement patterns and spatial arrangements
- Sacred spaces and cultural landmarks
- Community gathering areas and their significance

### Local Resources
- Available building materials (bamboo, earth, stone, etc.)
- Traditional craftsmanship and building techniques
- Potential for sustainable material harvesting

### Infrastructure and Accessibility
- Road networks and transportation challenges
- Access to water and electricity
- Waste management considerations

## Effective Presentation Techniques for Architectural Proposals

### Visual Communication
- Clear, legible drawings and diagrams
- Use of color to highlight key design elements
- 3D renderings to convey spatial qualities

### Verbal Presentation Skills
- Structuring the presentation narrative
- Explaining design decisions and their rationale
- Addressing potential questions and concerns

### Community Engagement Strategies
- Using local language and culturally appropriate terminology
- Incorporating visual aids that resonate with the community
- Facilitating dialogue and gathering feedback

# Discussion Questions

1. How can traditional Timorese building techniques be adapted to meet modern sustainability standards?
2. What are the main challenges in implementing sustainable architecture in Timor-Leste, and how can they be overcome?
3. How can we balance the use of local materials with the need for disaster-resistant structures in Timor-Leste?
4. In what ways can sustainable architecture contribute to preserving Timorese cultural identity?
5. How might climate change impact architectural design decisions in Timor-Leste over the next few decades?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Essay: Sustainable Design Process

Write a 500-word reflective essay on your design process for the final project. Consider the following points:

1. Initial inspirations and influences from Timorese culture and traditional architecture
2. Challenges encountered in integrating sustainable practices with local building techniques
3. How your understanding of sustainable local architecture has evolved throughout the course
4. The most significant lessons learned from community engagement and participatory design
5. Your vision for the future of sustainable architecture in Timor-Leste

# Assignment Details
