# Support Material for Sustainable Local Architecture in Timor-Leste Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Site analysis**: The process of evaluating a location's physical and environmental characteristics to inform design decisions.
- **Vernacular architecture**: Building styles that use local materials and traditions, designed to reflect the environmental, cultural, and historical context of an area.
- **Passive design strategies**: Architectural techniques that take advantage of natural climate to maintain comfortable conditions without mechanical systems.
- **Community engagement**: The process of working collaboratively with community members to ensure the project meets local needs and respects cultural values.
- **Sustainable development**: Development that meets present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
- **Bioclimatic design**: An approach to architecture that takes into account climate and environmental conditions to help achieve optimal thermal comfort inside.
- **Thermal mass**: Materials with the capacity to store heat, helping to regulate indoor temperatures.
- **Natural ventilation**: The process of supplying and removing air through an indoor space without using mechanical systems.
- **Indigenous knowledge**: Traditional knowledge and practices developed by local communities over generations.
- **Embodied energy**: The total energy required for the extraction, processing, manufacture, and delivery of building materials to the site.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Site Analysis Diagram**: A visual representation of a typical site in Timor-Leste, showing topography, vegetation, water sources, and prevailing winds. Annotations highlight key considerations for sustainable design.

2. **Local Materials Infographic**: A visual display of common sustainable building materials in Timor-Leste, including bamboo, earth, and local timber. Each material is accompanied by icons representing its properties (e.g., strength, insulation, availability).

3. **Passive Design Strategies Illustration**: A cross-section of a building demonstrating various passive design techniques such as natural ventilation, shading, and thermal mass. Arrows and labels explain how each strategy works.

4. **Traditional Timorese House Sketch**: A detailed drawing of a traditional Timorese house, with callouts identifying key architectural features and their functions.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Site Analysis Worksheet**: A template for students to complete during the site analysis exercise, including sections for:
   - Climate data (temperature, rainfall, humidity)
   - Topography and drainage
   - Vegetation and natural features
   - Cultural and social context
   - Opportunities and constraints

2. **Material Selection Matrix**: A table for students to evaluate different local materials based on criteria such as:
   - Sustainability
   - Durability
   - Cultural significance
   - Cost
   - Ease of use
   Students rate each material on a scale of 1-5 for each criterion.

3. **Design Concept Development Guide**: A structured worksheet to help students develop their initial design concepts, including prompts for:
   - Site layout and building orientation
   - Material choices and rationale
   - Passive design strategies incorporated
   - Cultural elements and their significance
   - Preliminary sketches

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Sustainable Architecture in Timor-Leste: Bridging Tradition and Innovation" by Maria Silva (fictional academic paper)
2. "Building with Bamboo: A Handbook" by Jules J.A. Janssen
3. "Earth Architecture" by Ronald Rael
4. Online course: "Sustainable Building Design for Tropical Climates" offered by edX
5. Case study collection: "Sustainable Architecture in Southeast Asia" by Green Building Council Indonesia
6. Timor-Leste government website section on sustainable development initiatives

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may lack familiarity with Timor-Leste's specific context.
   **Solution**: Provide a comprehensive briefing on Timor-Leste's geography, climate, and culture at the beginning of the course. Consider inviting guest speakers from Timor-Leste or organizing virtual tours.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to local materials for hands-on experience.
   **Solution**: Create a "material library" with samples of local materials. If possible, arrange for virtual demonstrations by local craftspeople.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to balance traditional techniques with modern sustainability requirements.
   **Solution**: Emphasize the concept of "critical regionalism" and provide examples of successful projects that blend tradition and innovation.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in simulating real community engagement in a classroom setting.
   **Solution**: Organize role-playing exercises and, if possible, arrange for video calls with actual community members in Timor-Leste.

5. **Challenge**: Students may have varying levels of technical drawing or design software skills.
   **Solution**: Provide additional resources and tutorials for design software. Encourage peer-to-peer learning and consider offering extra help sessions.

6. **Challenge**: Ensuring designs are culturally appropriate and respectful.
   **Solution**: Develop a checklist of cultural considerations in collaboration with Timorese cultural experts. Encourage students to justify their design choices in terms of cultural appropriateness.
