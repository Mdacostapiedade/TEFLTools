# Lesson Plan: Design Science and Comprehensive Problem-Solving

## Resources Needed
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts on design science principles
- Case study materials on a local infrastructure project
- Sticky notes and large sheets of paper for group work

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain the key principles of Fuller's design science approach
2. Apply comprehensive problem-solving techniques to a local issue
3. Analyze a case study using design science principles
4. Develop a preliminary solution for a community-identified problem

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
1. Display an image of a complex local problem (e.g., traffic congestion, waste management)
2. Ask students to individually write down 3 potential causes and 3 potential solutions
3. Share ideas in pairs, then briefly discuss as a class

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)
Define and discuss the following terms:
- Design science
- Comprehensive anticipatory design
- Synergy
- Systems thinking
- Ephemeralization

## Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Introduction to Fuller's design science approach
   - Origins and key principles
   - Comprehensive anticipatory design science
2. Steps in comprehensive problem-solving
   - Identifying the problem
   - Analyzing interconnected systems
   - Generating innovative solutions
   - Anticipating future impacts
3. Case study presentation: Local infrastructure project
   - Overview of the project
   - Challenges and current approach

## Practice Activities (40 minutes)
1. Case Study Analysis (20 minutes)
   - Divide class into small groups
   - Distribute case study materials
   - Groups analyze the project using design science principles
   - Identify strengths and weaknesses of the current approach

2. Group Discussion (20 minutes)
   - Each group presents their analysis
   - Class discusses alternative approaches using design science

## Production Task (40 minutes)
1. Community Problem-Solving
   - Introduce a community-identified problem
   - In groups, students apply the comprehensive problem-solving steps
   - Develop a preliminary design solution
   - Create a visual representation of the solution

## Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
1. Groups briefly present their solutions
2. Class discussion on how design science principles were applied
3. Recap key points of the lesson

## Homework Assignment
1. Research an innovative solution to a global problem that could be adapted for Timor-Leste
2. Write a one-page proposal outlining how this solution could be implemented using design science principles

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Design Science: The application of scientific principles to the design of structures and systems to optimize efficiency and sustainability
- Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science: Fuller's approach to solving problems by considering all factors and anticipating future needs
- Synergy: The interaction of multiple elements in a system to produce an effect greater than the sum of their individual effects
- Systems Thinking: An approach to problem-solving that views problems as parts of an overall system
- Ephemeralization: Fuller's term for the ability to do "more and more with less and less until eventually you can do everything with nothing"
