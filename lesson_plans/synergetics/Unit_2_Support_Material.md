Here are the support materials for the lesson plan on Design Science and Comprehensive Problem-Solving:

# Support Materials

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Design Science: The application of scientific principles to the design of structures and systems to optimize efficiency and sustainability.
- Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science: Fuller's approach to solving problems by considering all factors and anticipating future needs.
- Synergy: The interaction of multiple elements in a system to produce an effect greater than the sum of their individual effects.
- Systems Thinking: An approach to problem-solving that views problems as parts of an overall system.
- Ephemeralization: Fuller's term for the ability to do "more and more with less and less until eventually you can do everything with nothing."
- Interconnectedness: The state of having connections or relationships with other parts or systems.
- Innovation: The introduction of new ideas, methods, or technologies to solve problems or improve processes.
- Sustainability: The ability to maintain or support a process or system over the long term without depleting resources or causing harm to the environment.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Design Science Principles Diagram:
   - A circular diagram with "Design Science" at the center
   - Surrounding the center, include key principles: Systems Thinking, Anticipatory Design, Synergy, Sustainability, and Innovation
   - Connect these principles with arrows to show their interrelationships

2. Comprehensive Problem-Solving Steps Flowchart:
   - A linear flowchart showing the steps:
     1. Identify the Problem
     2. Analyze Interconnected Systems
     3. Generate Innovative Solutions
     4. Anticipate Future Impacts
     5. Implement and Evaluate
   - Include small icons or symbols next to each step to visually represent the action

3. Systems Thinking Mind Map:
   - Central node labeled "Local Issue" (e.g., Traffic Congestion)
   - Branch out to connected systems: Transportation, Urban Planning, Economy, Environment, Social Behavior
   - Further branch out to show specific elements within each system

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Design Science Principles Application Worksheet:
   - Brief explanation of each principle
   - Space for students to write examples of how each principle could be applied to a local issue
   - A section for students to sketch a preliminary design solution incorporating these principles

2. Case Study Analysis Guide:
   - Overview of the case study
   - Questions to guide analysis:
     * What systems are involved in this project?
     * How does the current approach address interconnectedness?
     * Where could synergy be improved?
     * How does the project anticipate future needs?
   - Space for students to note strengths and weaknesses of the current approach

3. Community Problem-Solving Worksheet:
   - Problem statement section
   - Guided sections for each problem-solving step
   - Space for sketching or diagramming the proposed solution
   - Reflection questions on how design science principles were applied

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Books:
   - "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth" by R. Buckminster Fuller
   - "Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things" by William McDonough & Michael Braungart

2. Online Resources:
   - Buckminster Fuller Institute website (www.bfi.org)
   - "Introduction to Systems Thinking" course on Coursera

3. Videos:
   - "The Fuller Challenge" documentary
   - TED Talk: "Designing for the Circular Economy" by Kate Raworth

4. Local Resources:
   - Reports from Timor-Leste's Ministry of Public Works on infrastructure projects
   - Case studies from local NGOs on community development initiatives

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling to grasp abstract concepts of systems thinking
   - Tip: Use local, relatable examples to illustrate interconnected systems. Start with simple systems (e.g., a school) before moving to more complex ones.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in applying design science principles to real-world problems
   - Tip: Provide structured worksheets and guided practice. Use think-aloud demonstrations to model the problem-solving process.

3. Challenge: Limited background knowledge of Timor-Leste's specific challenges
   - Tip: Incorporate pre-reading assignments or short presentations on local issues. Invite guest speakers from local organizations to share insights.

4. Challenge: Students feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of comprehensive problem-solving
   - Tip: Break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. Encourage group work to allow for collaborative problem-solving.

5. Challenge: Balancing innovation with practical constraints of Timor-Leste
   - Tip: Emphasize the importance of context-appropriate solutions. Encourage students to consider local resources, skills, and cultural factors in their designs.
