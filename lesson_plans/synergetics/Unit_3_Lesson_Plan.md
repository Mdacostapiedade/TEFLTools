# Lesson Plan: Sustainable Resource Management in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts on Timor-Leste's natural resources
- Markers and large sheets of paper for group work
- Field trip permission forms and transportation
- Guest speaker from local resource management organization

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify and describe Timor-Leste's key natural resources
- Explain at least three challenges in managing these resources sustainably
- Apply Fuller's synergetic principles to develop innovative resource management solutions
- Design a basic sustainable water management system for a local community

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students match pictures of Timor-Leste's natural resources with their names and primary uses
- Brief discussion on the importance of these resources to the country's development

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and explain key terms:
  * Sustainable resource management
  * Synergetics
  * Ecosystem services
  * Renewable vs. non-renewable resources
  * Resource depletion
- Students create a visual glossary using drawings or diagrams to represent each term

## 5. Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Overview of Timor-Leste's Natural Resources
- Presentation on key resources: oil and gas, forests, water, minerals
- Discussion of current management practices and challenges

### Sustainable Resource Management Strategies
- Introduction to sustainable management principles
- Case studies of successful resource management in similar contexts

### Applying Synergetics to Resource Conservation
- Explanation of Fuller's synergetic approach
- Examples of how synergetics can be applied to resource management

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Small group discussions: Analyze a specific resource challenge in Timor-Leste
- Brainstorming session: Apply synergetic principles to develop potential solutions

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

- Group project: Design a sustainable water management system for a local community
  * Students work in teams to create a basic design
  * Incorporate synergetic principles and local materials
  * Prepare a short presentation of their design

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Groups present their water management system designs
- Class discussion on the strengths and potential improvements of each design
- Quick review of key concepts covered in the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research one successful sustainable resource management project from another developing country
- Write a one-page report on how similar approaches could be applied in Timor-Leste
- Prepare questions for the upcoming field trip to a local resource management site

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Sustainable resource management: The use of natural resources in a way that meets current needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs
- Synergetics: Fuller's approach to problem-solving that emphasizes the behavior of whole systems rather than their parts in isolation
- Ecosystem services: The benefits people obtain from ecosystems, such as clean water, pollination, and climate regulation
- Renewable resources: Natural resources that can be replenished naturally over time, such as solar energy or forests
- Non-renewable resources: Natural resources that cannot be easily replenished, such as fossil fuels or minerals
- Resource depletion: The consumption of a resource faster than it can be replenished
