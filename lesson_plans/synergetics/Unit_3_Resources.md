# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Synergetic Solution for Resource Management

1. Choose one of Timor-Leste's natural resources (oil and gas, forests, water, or minerals) as your focus.
2. Identify three major challenges in managing this resource sustainably.
3. Apply Fuller's synergetic principles to develop an innovative solution that addresses these challenges.
4. Write a 500-word proposal outlining your solution, including:
   - A brief description of the resource and its importance to Timor-Leste
   - The key challenges in managing this resource sustainably
   - Your proposed synergetic solution, explaining how it applies Fuller's principles
   - The potential benefits and impacts of your solution on the resource, local communities, and the environment
   - Any potential obstacles to implementing your solution and how they might be overcome
5. Include a simple diagram or sketch illustrating your proposed solution.

# Assignment Details

## Sustainable Water Management System Design

### Objective

4. Create a detailed design proposal including:
   - System overview and key components
   - Explanation of how synergetic principles are applied
   - Use of local materials and resources
   - Consideration of environmental impact and sustainability
   - Community involvement and maintenance plan
5. Prepare a 10-minute presentation of your design, including visual aids (e.g., diagrams, models).
6. Submit a written report (1500-2000 words) detailing your design process, rationale, and expected outcomes.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Innovative application of synergetic principles (30%)
