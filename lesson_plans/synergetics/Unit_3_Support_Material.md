# Support Material for Sustainable Resource Management in Timor-Leste Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Sustainable resource management**: The use of natural resources in a way that meets current needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs
- **Synergetics**: Fuller's approach to problem-solving that emphasizes the behavior of whole systems rather than their parts in isolation
- **Ecosystem services**: The benefits people obtain from ecosystems, such as clean water, pollination, and climate regulation
- **Renewable resources**: Natural resources that can be replenished naturally over time, such as solar energy or forests
- **Non-renewable resources**: Natural resources that cannot be easily replenished, such as fossil fuels or minerals
- **Resource depletion**: The consumption of a resource faster than it can be replenished
- **Biodiversity**: The variety of plant and animal life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
- **Carbon footprint**: The amount of carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds emitted due to the consumption of fossil fuels by a particular person, group, or organization
- **Sustainable development**: Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Map of Timor-Leste's Natural Resources**
   - A color-coded map of Timor-Leste showing the distribution of key natural resources:
     * Oil and gas deposits (offshore)
     * Forests (green areas)
     * Major water sources (rivers, lakes)
     * Mineral deposits (marked with symbols)

2. **Synergetics Principles Diagram**
   - A visual representation of Fuller's synergetic principles:
     * Interconnected nodes representing different elements of a system
     * Arrows showing relationships and interactions between elements
     * Key principles listed around the diagram (e.g., "Whole systems behavior", "Tensegrity", "Doing more with less")

3. **Sustainable Water Management System Infographic**
   - A step-by-step illustration of a basic sustainable water management system:
     * Rainwater collection
     * Filtration methods
     * Storage solutions
     * Distribution systems
     * Waste water treatment and recycling

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Timor-Leste Natural Resources Fact Sheet**
   - Brief overview of key resources (oil, gas, forests, water, minerals)
   - Current production/usage statistics
   - Main challenges in managing each resource
   - Potential sustainable management strategies

2. **Synergetic Problem-Solving Worksheet**
   - Step-by-step guide to applying synergetic principles to a resource management problem:
     1. Identify the problem
     2. Map the system components
     3. Analyze interactions and relationships
     4. Identify leverage points for change
     5. Develop holistic solutions
   - Space for students to work through an example problem

3. **Sustainable Water Management System Design Template**
   - Outline for students to fill in when designing their water management system:
     * Community needs assessment
     * Available local materials
     * System components (collection, filtration, storage, distribution)
     * Maintenance and sustainability considerations
     * Diagram/sketch of the proposed system

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030" - Government document outlining long-term development goals
2. "Water Resource Management in Timor-Leste: An Assessment of the Challenges and Opportunities" - Research paper by local university
3. "Synergetics: Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking" by R. Buckminster Fuller - For deeper understanding of synergetic principles
4. Online course: "Introduction to Water and Climate" by DelftX on edX - For broader context on water management
5. Documentary: "The 11th Hour" - Explores global environmental challenges and solutions

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to grasp abstract concepts like synergetics.
   **Solution**: Use concrete, local examples and hands-on activities to illustrate principles. Encourage students to find everyday examples of interconnected systems.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to up-to-date information on Timor-Leste's resources.
   **Solution**: Invite local experts or government officials as guest speakers. Encourage students to conduct interviews with community members about resource use.

3. **Challenge**: Students may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of resource management issues.
   **Solution**: Break down problems into manageable components. Use the synergetic approach to show how small changes can have significant impacts.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in visualizing large-scale systems.
   **Solution**: Use multimedia resources, such as videos or interactive online tools, to help students visualize complex systems. Create physical models or role-playing exercises to demonstrate system interactions.

5. **Challenge**: Bridging traditional practices with modern sustainable approaches.
   **Solution**: Discuss the value of traditional knowledge in resource management. Encourage students to interview elders about historical resource use practices and explore how these can be integrated with modern techniques.
