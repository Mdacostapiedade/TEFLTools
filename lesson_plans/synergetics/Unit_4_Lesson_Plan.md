# Lesson Plan: Geodesic Structures and Sustainable Housing

## 1. Resources Needed

- Small wooden dowels or straws and connectors for geodesic dome models
- Projector and computer for presentations
- Handouts with diagrams of geodesic structures
- Local building materials samples (bamboo, thatch, etc.)
- Images of traditional Timorese houses and modern sustainable housing

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the basic principles of geodesic structures
- Identify the advantages of geodesic domes for sustainable housing
- Describe how geodesic principles can be applied to Timor-Leste's housing challenges
- Construct a small-scale geodesic dome model
- Design a sustainable housing prototype incorporating local materials and techniques

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show images of various housing structures from around the world, including traditional Timorese houses and geodesic domes
- Ask students to discuss in pairs: What are the strengths and weaknesses of each design for Timor-Leste's climate and resources?

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Geodesic dome
- Tensegrity
- Synergetic
- Sustainable housing
- Climate-responsive design
- Vernacular architecture

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Introduction to geodesic structures and Buckminster Fuller's principles
- Advantages of geodesic domes (strength, efficiency, sustainability)
- Tensegrity structures and their applications
- Sustainable housing solutions for tropical climates
- Overview of local materials and traditional building techniques in Timor-Leste
- Case studies of successful sustainable housing projects in similar climates

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Divide the class into small groups
- Provide each group with materials to build a small geodesic dome model
- Guide students through the construction process, emphasizing key principles

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

- In the same groups, have students brainstorm and sketch a sustainable housing prototype for rural Timor-Leste
- Encourage incorporation of geodesic principles, local materials, and traditional techniques
- Groups should consider climate, resources, and cultural factors in their designs

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Each group presents their housing prototype briefly to the class
- Class discussion on how the designs address Timor-Leste's housing challenges
- Recap key points about geodesic structures and sustainable housing

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research one traditional Timorese building technique and one modern sustainable building method
- Write a short report (1-2 pages) on how these could be combined in a synergetic approach to housing design

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Geodesic dome: A spherical structure composed of a network of triangles that distribute stress evenly
- Tensegrity: A structural principle based on the use of isolated components in compression inside a net of continuous tension
- Synergetic: Relating to the interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects
- Sustainable housing: Homes designed to minimize environmental impact and maximize efficiency of resource use
- Climate-responsive design: Architectural approach that takes into account local climate conditions to create comfortable and energy-efficient buildings
- Vernacular architecture: Building style using local materials and traditions, specifically adapted for local climate and culture
