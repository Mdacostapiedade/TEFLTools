# Lesson Plan: Energy Systems and Renewable Technologies in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Laptops or tablets with internet access
- Projector and screen
- Whiteboard and markers
- Energy consumption measuring devices (e.g., electricity usage monitors)
- Materials for building small-scale renewable energy models (e.g., small solar panels, miniature wind turbines, cardboard, glue, scissors)
- Handouts on Timor-Leste's energy landscape and renewable energy technologies

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Analyze Timor-Leste's current energy needs and challenges
- Identify potential renewable energy sources suitable for Timor-Leste
- Apply synergetic principles to design sustainable energy solutions
- Conduct a basic energy audit
- Create a small-scale renewable energy system design

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Energy source brainstorming: In small groups, students list all the energy sources they use in their daily lives and categorize them as renewable or non-renewable.
- Groups share their lists, and the teacher compiles a master list on the whiteboard.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Renewable energy
- Fossil fuels
- Energy audit
- Solar power
- Wind energy
- Hydroelectric power
- Biomass
- Geothermal energy
- Energy efficiency

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### a. Timor-Leste's Energy Landscape
- Overview of current energy production and consumption
- Challenges in energy access and distribution
- Dependence on fossil fuels and environmental impacts

### b. Renewable Energy Potential in Timor-Leste
- Solar energy potential
- Wind energy resources
- Hydroelectric possibilities
- Biomass and geothermal options

### c. Synergetic Approach to Energy Systems
- Interconnectedness of energy systems
- Holistic design principles
- Integrating multiple renewable sources
- Energy storage and distribution considerations

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### a. Energy Audit Exercise (20 minutes)
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group conducts a mini energy audit of the classroom or a designated area of the school
- Groups use energy consumption measuring devices and observation to assess energy use
- Groups brainstorm ways to improve energy efficiency

### b. Renewable Energy Matching Game (20 minutes)
- Create cards with renewable energy sources and their characteristics
- Students match the energy sources with their benefits and challenges
- Discuss which sources might be most suitable for different regions of Timor-Leste

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

### Small-scale Renewable Energy System Design
- In groups of 3-4, students design a small-scale renewable energy system for a rural community in Timor-Leste
- Each group is assigned a specific region with unique geographical and resource characteristics
- Groups must incorporate at least two different renewable energy sources in their design
- Students create a simple model or diagram of their system
- Groups prepare a brief presentation explaining their design choices and how they applied synergetic principles

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Each group presents their renewable energy system design (2-3 minutes per group)
- Class discussion on the strengths and potential challenges of each design
- Recap of key points from the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students conduct an energy audit of their home or a local business
- Write a 1-2 page report on their findings, including:
  - Current energy usage patterns
  - Potential for energy efficiency improvements
  - Recommendations for incorporating renewable energy sources
- Research one renewable energy project currently being developed or implemented in Timor-Leste and prepare a short summary

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Renewable energy: Energy from sources that are naturally replenishing and virtually inexhaustible
- Fossil fuels: Non-renewable energy sources formed from the remains of plants and animals over millions of years
- Energy audit: A survey and analysis of energy use in a building or system
- Solar power: Energy derived from the sun's radiation
- Wind energy: Energy harnessed from the movement of air
- Hydroelectric power: Electricity generated by the flow of water
- Biomass: Organic matter used as a fuel source
- Geothermal energy: Heat energy generated and stored in the Earth
- Energy efficiency: Using less energy to perform the same task or produce the same result
