# Support Material for Energy Systems and Renewable Technologies in Timor-Leste

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- Renewable energy: Energy from sources that are naturally replenishing and virtually inexhaustible
- Fossil fuels: Non-renewable energy sources formed from the remains of plants and animals over millions of years
- Energy audit: A survey and analysis of energy use in a building or system
- Solar power: Energy derived from the sun's radiation
- Wind energy: Energy harnessed from the movement of air
- Hydroelectric power: Electricity generated by the flow of water
- Biomass: Organic matter used as a fuel source
- Geothermal energy: Heat energy generated and stored in the Earth
- Energy efficiency: Using less energy to perform the same task or produce the same result
- Synergetic: Relating to the interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

   - Instructions for playing the matching game

3. Timor-Leste Energy Profile:
   - Current energy production and consumption statistics
   - Breakdown of energy sources (fossil fuels vs. renewables)
   - Major challenges in energy access and distribution
   - Government goals and initiatives for renewable energy

4. Small-scale Renewable Energy System Design Worksheet:

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Limited access to technology:
   - Prepare printed materials and offline resources as backups
   - Encourage group work to share available devices
   - Use physical models and hands-on activities when possible

2. Varying levels of prior knowledge:
   - Conduct a pre-lesson survey to assess students' background knowledge
   - Provide additional resources for students who need extra support
   - Use peer teaching to leverage students with more advanced knowledge

3. Language barriers:
   - Provide key vocabulary in both English and Tetum
   - Use visual aids and demonstrations to support explanations
   - Encourage students to express ideas in their preferred language and help translate

4. Connecting global concepts to local context:
   - Invite local experts or community members to share their experiences
   - Use case studies and examples specific to Timor-Leste
   - Encourage students to relate lesson content to their own observations and experiences

5. Limited materials for hands-on activities:
   - Prepare alternative activities using locally available materials
   - Partner with local organizations or businesses to source materials
   - Encourage creative problem-solving by challenging students to design with limited resources

6. Maintaining engagement during theoretical portions:
   - Incorporate interactive elements like quick quizzes or discussions
   - Use real-world examples and scenarios to illustrate concepts
   - Break up longer presentations with short, hands-on activities or group discussions
