# Lesson Plan: Transportation and Communication Networks in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Large map of Timor-Leste
- Colored markers, sticky notes
- Laptops or tablets with internet access
- Projector and screen
- Handouts on Timor-Leste's current infrastructure
- Cardboard, scissors, glue for prototyping

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify key challenges in Timor-Leste's transportation and communication networks
- Apply systems thinking to analyze connectivity issues
- Propose innovative solutions for improving rural transportation and communication

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Students form small groups and brainstorm all the ways they communicated or traveled in the past week
- Groups share their lists, instructor creates a master list on the board
- Brief discussion on how these methods might differ in rural Timor-Leste

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

- Infrastructure
- Connectivity
- Rural access
- Sustainable transportation
- Last-mile delivery
- Digital divide

Instructor introduces and explains each term, providing context relevant to Timor-Leste.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Current Transportation Infrastructure in Timor-Leste
- Overview of road network
- Public transportation systems
- Challenges in rural areas

### Communication Networks
- Mobile phone coverage
- Internet access statistics
- Rural connectivity issues

### Sustainable Transportation Solutions
- Examples from other developing countries
- Potential applications in Timor-Leste

### Systems Thinking Approach to Connectivity
- Interconnectedness of transportation and communication
- Impact on education, healthcare, and economic development

## 6. Practice Activities (40 minutes)

### Activity 1: Mapping Exercise (20 minutes)
- In groups, students use the large map to identify and mark:
  - Major transportation routes
  - Areas with limited access
  - Communication network coverage
- Groups present their findings, discussing patterns and challenges

### Activity 2: Systems Analysis (20 minutes)
- Students create a simple systems diagram showing how transportation and communication networks interact with other aspects of Timorese society (e.g., education, healthcare, economy)
- Class discussion on key relationships and potential leverage points for improvement

## 7. Production Task (40 minutes)

### Innovative Solution Proposal
- In pairs, students design an innovative solution for either:
  1. Improving rural transportation access, or
  2. Enhancing communication in remote areas
- Students create a simple prototype or visual representation of their solution
- Pairs present their ideas to the class, explaining how it addresses systemic challenges

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion on common themes in proposed solutions
- Review of key challenges and potential synergies between transportation and communication improvements
- Quick quiz on key vocabulary and concepts

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students will:
1. Research a successful transportation or communication project from another developing country
2. Write a 1-page proposal adapting this solution to Timor-Leste's context, using systems thinking principles
3. Prepare to share their findings in the next class
