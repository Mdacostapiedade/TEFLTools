# Excerpts and Short Stories

## From "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth" by R. Buckminster Fuller

"We are all astronauts on a little spaceship called Earth."

"There are no passengers on Spaceship Earth. We are all crew."

"The most important thing to teach your children is that the sun does not rise and set. It is the Earth that revolves around the sun. Then teach them the concepts of North, South, East and West, and that they relate to where they happen to be on the planet's surface at that time. Everything else will follow."

## From "Critical Path" by R. Buckminster Fuller

"We are called to be architects of the future, not its victims."

"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."

"The best way to predict the future is to design it."

# Additional Materials and Examples

## Case Study: Escuela Nueva, Colombia

Escuela Nueva is a community-based education model that originated in rural Colombia and has been adapted in various countries. It emphasizes:

- Flexible, student-centered learning
- Active community participation
- Peer tutoring and collaborative learning
- Integration of local knowledge and culture

This model has shown success in improving access to education, reducing dropout rates, and enhancing learning outcomes in rural areas.

## Example: Mobile Learning Initiative in Papua New Guinea

The PNG EQUITV program uses tablet devices preloaded with educational content to reach students in remote areas. Key features include:

- Offline access to curriculum-aligned materials
- Interactive learning activities and assessments
- Teacher training and support components
- Solar charging capabilities for areas without electricity

This initiative demonstrates how mobile technology can be used to overcome geographical and infrastructure challenges in education.

## Resource: UNESCO's Guidelines on Intercultural Education

These guidelines provide a framework for integrating cultural diversity and traditional knowledge into education systems. Key principles include:

1. Respect for the cultural identity of the learner
2. Provision of culturally appropriate and responsive quality education for all
3. Promotion of knowledge, attitudes, and skills that enable learners to contribute to respect, understanding, and solidarity among individuals, ethnic, social, cultural, and religious groups, and nations

These principles can inform the development of culturally sensitive and inclusive education programs in Timor-Leste.
