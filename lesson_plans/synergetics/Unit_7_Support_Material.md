## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling to grasp abstract concepts of synergetics
   - Solution: Use physical models and hands-on activities to demonstrate synergetic principles. Encourage students to find examples in nature and their daily lives.

2. Challenge: Limited access to technology for mobile learning platform design
   - Solution: Focus on low-tech solutions and paper prototyping. Emphasize the importance of designing for offline use and limited connectivity.

3. Challenge: Difficulty in relating Fuller's global principles to local contexts
   - Solution: Invite local community leaders or educators as guest speakers to provide context. Encourage students to interview family members about local challenges.

4. Challenge: Group dynamics issues during collaborative activities
   - Solution: Assign roles within groups (e.g., facilitator, note-taker, presenter). Provide clear guidelines for respectful communication and equal participation.

5. Challenge: Time management for complex activities
   - Solution: Break larger tasks into smaller, timed segments. Use visual timers and provide regular updates on remaining time for each activity.

6. Challenge: Varying levels of English proficiency among students
   - Solution: Provide key vocabulary in both English and Tetum. Allow students to discuss in their preferred language, with summaries presented in English.

7. Challenge: Limited knowledge of Timor-Leste's specific educational context
   - Solution: Provide a pre-reading packet with key statistics and background information. Create a shared class document where students can contribute facts and insights they discover during research.
