## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

2. Cultural Differences:
   - Draw parallels between tai chi concepts and local Timorese traditions
   - Be open to discussions about how internal energy arts relate to local healing practices
   - Adapt terminology or explanations to fit local cultural context when appropriate

3. Physical Limitations:
   - Offer modifications for all movements to accommodate different fitness levels or physical limitations
   - Emphasize that internal aspects (breathing, focus) are as important as physical movements

4. Skepticism about Benefits:
   - Provide scientific research supporting health benefits when available
   - Invite local healthcare professionals to discuss complementary benefits of tai chi
   - Encourage students to keep a journal of their experiences and any noticed improvements

5. Maintaining Regular Practice:
   - Set realistic expectations for home practice (start with just 5 minutes daily)
   - Create a buddy system for students to practice together outside of class
   - Provide a clear structure for home practice routines
