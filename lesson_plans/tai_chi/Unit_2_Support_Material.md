## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students with pre-existing postural issues or physical limitations
   - **Solution**: Offer modifications and emphasize gradual improvement. Encourage students to work within their comfort zone and consult healthcare providers if necessary.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in sensing subtle alignment issues
   - **Solution**: Use hands-on adjustments (with permission) and visual aids. Encourage partner work for feedback.

3. **Challenge**: Maintaining student engagement during static posture work
   - **Solution**: Incorporate brief, dynamic exercises between alignment practices. Use analogies and real-life examples to illustrate the importance of good posture.

4. **Challenge**: Cultural differences in body awareness and physical contact
   - **Solution**: Be sensitive to cultural norms. Offer alternative methods for posture checking that don't require physical contact if needed.

5. **Challenge**: Translating technical terms into local language
   - **Solution**: Work with a local translator to find appropriate Tetum equivalents for key terms. Use visual aids and physical demonstrations to supplement verbal explanations.
