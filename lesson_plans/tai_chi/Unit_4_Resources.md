## Basic Tai Chi Movements

### Ward Off (Peng)

- Elbows slightly bent, shoulders relaxed
- Imagine creating a protective bubble around yourself

### Roll Back (Lu)

- Yielding movement
- Body turns to the side while arms make a circular motion
- Hands draw back towards the hip
- Visualize drawing an opponent's energy in and redirecting it

### Press (Ji)

- Forward movement
- One hand presses forward at chest level
- Other hand supports at waist level
- Imagine gently pressing against a large ball

### Push (An)

- Two-handed forward movement
- Both palms face forward at chest level
- Elbows slightly bent, shoulders relaxed
- Visualize pushing a heavy object away from your body

## Concept of Continuous, Flowing Movement

- Movements connect seamlessly without pause
- Energy flows from one posture to the next
- Imagine your body moving through water
- Breath coordinates with movement
- Mind remains focused and calm throughout the sequence

## Tai Chi Principles Applied to Daily Life

1. Maintain good posture:
   - Keep your spine straight and shoulders relaxed while sitting, standing, or walking
   - Imagine a thread pulling the top of your head towards the sky

2. Practice mindful breathing:
   - Take slow, deep breaths from your diaphragm during stressful situations
   - Focus on your breath to calm your mind and reduce tension

3. Move with awareness:
   - Pay attention to how you move your body during daily activities
   - Perform tasks with deliberate, smooth movements rather than rushed or jerky motions

4. Cultivate mental focus:
   - Bring your full attention to the task at hand, whether it's work, chores, or conversations
   - Practice being present in the moment, rather than dwelling on past or future concerns

5. Embrace flexibility and adaptability:
   - Like the yielding nature of tai chi movements, learn to be flexible in your approach to challenges
   - Instead of meeting force with force, look for ways to redirect energy or find alternative solutions

By incorporating these principles into your daily routine, you can extend the benefits of tai chi practice beyond the formal training sessions.
