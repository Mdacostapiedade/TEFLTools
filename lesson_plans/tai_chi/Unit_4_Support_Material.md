## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with balance
   - Tip: Encourage students to widen their stance slightly and focus on shifting weight slowly. Provide chairs for support if needed.

2. Challenge: Difficulty maintaining continuous movement
   - Tip: Start with very slow, exaggerated movements. Use metaphors like "moving through water" to help students visualize the flow.

3. Challenge: Confusion about the sequence of movements
   - Tip: Break down the sequence into smaller parts. Use numbered steps and visual cues (e.g., colored cards) to help students remember the order.

4. Challenge: Students feeling self-conscious about movement
   - Tip: Create a supportive, non-judgmental atmosphere. Emphasize that tai chi is a personal practice and everyone progresses at their own pace.

5. Challenge: Adapting the practice to different physical abilities
   - Tip: Offer modifications for each movement (e.g., seated versions). Encourage students to listen to their bodies and adjust as needed.

6. Challenge: Connecting tai chi concepts to local Timorese culture
   - Tip: Invite students to share similar concepts from Timorese traditions. Draw parallels between tai chi principles and local practices or beliefs.
