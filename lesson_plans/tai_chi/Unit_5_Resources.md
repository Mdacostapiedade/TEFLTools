   - Focus on relaxation and sinking qi to the lower dantian
   - Duration: start with 2-5 minutes, gradually increase

2. Sensing Qi Between Palms
   - Stand with palms facing each other, about 6 inches apart
   - Slowly move palms closer and further apart
   - Pay attention to sensations: warmth, tingling, magnetic feeling
   - Variations: try with eyes closed, different distances

#### Moving Practices for Qi Sensing
1. Tai Chi Walking
   - Slow, deliberate steps with weight shifting
   - Focus on feeling qi flow from the ground up through the body
   - Coordinate breathing with movement

2. Silk Reeling Exercises
   - Circular movements originating from the dantian
   - Emphasize smooth, continuous motion
   - Imagine drawing qi through the body with each movement

### Topic 2: Introduction to microcosmic orbit meditation

#### Understanding the Microcosmic Orbit
- Definition: energy pathway circling the torso
- Route: up the spine (Du Mai) and down the front (Ren Mai)
- Significance in Daoist meditation and energy cultivation

#### Basic Microcosmic Orbit Meditation Technique
1. Preparation
   - Seated position: cross-legged or on a chair
   - Spine straight, shoulders relaxed
   - Tongue touching the roof of the mouth

2. Focusing on Energy Centers
   - Lower dantian: about 3 finger widths below the navel
   - Mingmen: opposite lower dantian on the back
   - Baihui: crown of the head
   - Yintang: between the eyebrows

3. Circulating Energy
   - Begin at lower dantian
   - Visualize or feel energy moving up the spine
   - Over the head and down the front of the body
   - Complete the circuit back to the lower dantian
   - Repeat for several cycles

4. Ending the Meditation
   - Return focus to lower dantian
   - Gently massage the abdomen
   - Slowly open eyes and return to normal awareness

### Topic 3: Techniques for gathering and storing qi in the lower dantian

#### Understanding the Lower Dantian
- Location: about 3 finger widths below the navel
- Significance: energy reservoir, center of gravity
- Role in tai chi and qi gong practices

#### Qi Gathering Techniques
1. Abdominal Breathing
   - Focus on deep, diaphragmatic breathing
   - Expand lower abdomen on inhale, contract on exhale
   - Visualize qi entering the body with each breath

2. "Embracing the Tree" Qi Gathering
   - Stand in Zhan Zhuang posture
   - Visualize roots growing from feet into the earth
   - Imagine drawing energy from the earth into the dantian
   - Hold intention of qi sinking and collecting in the lower abdomen

3. "Washing the Marrow" Exercise
   - Gentle twisting movements of the spine
   - Coordinate with breath: twist on exhale, return on inhale
   - Visualize qi being wrung out of the spine and collecting in the dantian

#### Storing Qi in the Lower Dantian
- Importance of relaxation in qi storage
- Visualization techniques: imagining dantian as a glowing sphere
- Practice "sealing" the dantian after practice to retain qi

### Excerpt: "The Importance of Dantian in Tai Chi Practice" by Yang Jwing-Ming

"The dantian is the root of the tree of qi. It is the source of power and energy storage in the human body. In tai chi practice, we focus on the lower dantian, located in the lower abdomen. This area is the physical and energetic center of the body, the place where we store and cultivate qi.

When we practice tai chi, all movements should originate from the dantian. This not only helps to keep our movements centered and balanced but also allows us to access and utilize our qi more effectively. By consistently focusing on the dantian during practice, we strengthen our connection to this vital energy center, enhancing our ability to gather, store, and circulate qi throughout the body.

The development of a strong dantian through tai chi practice has numerous benefits. It improves our balance and stability, increases our internal energy, and enhances our overall health and vitality. Moreover, a well-developed dantian serves as a solid foundation for advanced tai chi techniques and deeper levels of meditation practice."
