## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students have difficulty sensing qi
   - **Tip**: Emphasize that sensing qi takes time and practice. Encourage students to focus on subtle sensations like warmth, tingling, or magnetic-like feelings between the hands.

2. **Challenge**: Cultural skepticism about qi and energy practices
   - **Tip**: Draw parallels to local Timorese concepts of life force or energy. Discuss scientific studies on the benefits of tai chi and qi gong practices for health.

3. **Challenge**: Students experience dizziness or lightheadedness during practice
   - **Tip**: Ensure students are breathing naturally and not forcing or holding their breath. Advise them to practice seated or lying down if necessary, and to stop if discomfort persists.

4. **Challenge**: Maintaining student engagement during meditation exercises
   - **Tip**: Start with shorter meditation periods and gradually increase duration. Use guided visualizations to help students stay focused.

5. **Challenge**: Students struggle with body awareness and proper alignment
   - **Tip**: Incorporate more partner work for postural checks. Use physical props or wall support to help students feel correct alignment.

6. **Challenge**: Integrating practice into daily life
   - **Tip**: Suggest "qi breaks" throughout the day, where students can practice brief exercises. Encourage them to associate daily activities with qi awareness.
