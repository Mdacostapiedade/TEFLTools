## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barrier:
   - Use simple, clear language and plenty of visual demonstrations
   - Provide handouts with key terms translated into Tetum
   - Encourage students to ask questions and clarify concepts

2. Cultural Differences:
   - Connect tai chi principles to local Timorese traditions and practices where possible
   - Be open to discussions about how tai chi concepts align with or differ from local beliefs

3. Physical Limitations:
   - Offer modifications for all exercises (e.g., seated versions of standing postures)
   - Emphasize that tai chi is adaptable to all fitness levels and abilities

4. Skepticism about Benefits:
   - Provide scientific evidence of tai chi's health benefits
   - Encourage students to keep a practice log to observe personal improvements

5. Difficulty with Mindfulness Concepts:
   - Start with very short, guided mindfulness exercises
   - Use relatable examples from daily Timorese life to explain mindfulness

6. Limited Practice Space:
   - Demonstrate how tai chi principles can be applied in small spaces
   - Encourage creativity in finding practice areas (e.g., outdoor spaces, community centers)

7. Maintaining Student Motivation:
   - Set achievable goals and celebrate small improvements
   - Organize group practice sessions outside of class time
   - Share success stories from other practitioners or scientific studies
