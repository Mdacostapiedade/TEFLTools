## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have preconceptions or fears about Tarot.
   **Solution**: Emphasize that Tarot is a tool for self-reflection and personal growth, not fortune-telling. Relate it to Timorese storytelling traditions.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in understanding abstract symbolism.
   **Solution**: Start with more concrete symbols and gradually introduce more abstract ones. Use local examples to bridge understanding.

3. **Challenge**: Cultural sensitivity when comparing Tarot to Timorese traditions.
   **Solution**: Always approach comparisons with respect and openness. Invite students to share their perspectives and knowledge of local traditions.

4. **Challenge**: Students struggling with card interpretation.
   **Solution**: Provide a structured approach to interpretation, such as the "Description, Feeling, Symbolism, Meaning" method. Encourage personal interpretations.

5. **Challenge**: Time management during the card creation activity.
   **Solution**: Provide a clear timeline for each step of the process. Consider extending the activity over two sessions if needed.

6. **Challenge**: Varying levels of artistic ability in card creation.
   **Solution**: Emphasize that the meaning and symbolism are more important than artistic skill. Provide templates or stencils for those who need them.
