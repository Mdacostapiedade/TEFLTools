### The Power of Numbers in Kabbalah
*Excerpt from "Introduction to the Kabbalah" by Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi*

In Kabbalah, numbers are not merely quantitative symbols but carry profound spiritual significance. Each number represents a unique quality or aspect of the divine. The number one, for instance, symbolizes unity and the singular nature of God. Two represents duality and the concept of balance. Three signifies harmony and the integration of opposites.

The Tree of Life, a central concept in Kabbalah, is composed of ten Sephiroth, each associated with a number from 1 to 10. These numbers are not just sequential but embody specific divine attributes. For example, Kether, the Crown, is associated with the number 1, representing the primordial unity of all existence.

Gematria, a system of assigning numerical value to words and phrases, is another way numbers play a crucial role in Kabbalistic thought. Through Gematria, hidden connections between concepts can be revealed, offering deeper insights into the nature of reality and the divine.

## 6. Additional Materials

### Timorese Naming Conventions for Numerology

In Timor-Leste, many people have Portuguese or Catholic-inspired names. When calculating the Destiny Number using Timorese names:

1. Use the full birth name (including middle names)
2. For names with Portuguese diacritical marks, use the base letter (e.g., 'Jo√£o' becomes 'Joao')
3. If a person has both a Timorese and Portuguese/Catholic name, calculate separately and compare results

### Number-Letter Correspondence Chart

A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4, E = 5, F = 6, G = 7, H = 8, I = 9
J = 1, K = 2, L = 3, M = 4, N = 5, O = 6, P = 7, Q = 8, R = 9
S = 1, T = 2, U = 3, V = 4, W = 5, X = 6, Y = 7, Z = 8

### Example: Calculating Destiny Number

Name: Maria da Costa
M (4) + A (1) + R (9) + I (9) + A (1) + D (4) + A (1) + C (3) + O (6) + S (1) + T (2) + A (1) = 42
4 + 2 = 6

Destiny Number: 6
