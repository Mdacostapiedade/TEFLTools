## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language Barrier**: 
   - Challenge: Students may struggle with TCM terminology.
   - Solution: Provide a glossary of terms in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids and analogies to explain complex concepts.

2. **Cultural Differences**: 
   - Challenge: Students may have difficulty reconciling TCM concepts with local beliefs.
   - Solution: Encourage open discussion about similarities and differences. Emphasize integration rather than replacement of local practices.

3. **Abstract Concepts**: 
   - Challenge: Some students may find Yin-Yang and Five Elements theories abstract.
   - Solution: Use concrete examples from nature and daily life. Incorporate hands-on activities and group discussions to reinforce understanding.

4. **Skepticism**: 
   - Challenge: Some students may be skeptical about TCM effectiveness.
   - Solution: Present scientific research supporting TCM practices. Invite guest speakers who have successfully integrated TCM in clinical settings.

5. **Practical Application**: 
   - Challenge: Students may struggle to see how to apply TCM concepts in real-life situations.
   - Solution: Use case studies and role-playing exercises. Encourage students to keep a journal of personal observations using TCM principles.

6. **Time Management**: 
   - Challenge: Covering all material within the allotted time.
   - Solution: Prioritize key concepts and use flipped classroom techniques, assigning pre-reading to maximize in-class discussion and practice time.
