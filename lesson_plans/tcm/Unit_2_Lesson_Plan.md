# Lesson Plan: TCM Diagnosis and Assessment

## Resources Needed
- Handouts with tongue and pulse diagnosis charts
- Images of different tongue conditions
- Pulse simulators or volunteers for practice
- Case study handouts
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector for slides (optional)

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Describe the four pillars of TCM diagnosis
2. Identify basic tongue and pulse characteristics in TCM diagnosis
3. Differentiate between Air, Fire, and Water constitution types
4. Apply basic diagnostic techniques to case studies

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Pair students and have them observe each other's tongues
- Ask them to describe what they see to their partner
- Discuss as a class: What did you notice? What might these observations tell us about health?

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)
Write and explain key terms on the whiteboard:
- Four pillars of diagnosis: Observation, Auscultation/Olfaction, Inquiry, Palpation
- Constitution types: Air, Fire, Water
- Tongue diagnosis terms: Color, Coating, Shape, Moisture
- Pulse diagnosis terms: Rate, Depth, Strength, Quality

## Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
1. Four Pillars of TCM Diagnosis
   - Explain each pillar with examples
   - Emphasize the holistic nature of TCM diagnosis

2. Air, Fire, and Water Constitution Types
   - Describe characteristics of each type
   - Discuss how constitution affects health and treatment

3. Tongue Diagnosis
   - Present images of different tongue conditions
   - Explain what each characteristic indicates

4. Pulse Diagnosis
   - Demonstrate proper pulse-taking technique
   - Describe different pulse qualities and their meanings

## Practice Activities (40 minutes)
1. Tongue Diagnosis Practice (20 minutes)
   - In pairs, students examine each other's tongues
   - Use handouts to record observations
   - Discuss findings as a class

2. Pulse Diagnosis Practice (20 minutes)
   - Use pulse simulators or volunteers
   - Students practice finding and describing pulses
   - Instructor provides feedback and guidance

## Production Task (30 minutes)
Case Study Analysis:
- Divide class into small groups
- Distribute case study handouts with patient descriptions
- Groups identify likely constitution type and potential imbalances based on given information
- Present findings to the class and discuss

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)
- Recap key points of the lesson
- Address any questions or misconceptions
- Quick quiz: Show images of tongues or describe pulses, have students identify key characteristics

## Homework Assignment
1. Practice tongue and pulse self-diagnosis daily for one week, keeping a journal of observations
2. Research and write a one-page report on how one's constitution type might influence their response to pain

## Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Observation (望 wàng): Visual inspection of the patient's body, demeanor, and tongue
- Auscultation/Olfaction (聞 wén): Listening to body sounds and noting body odors
- Inquiry (問 wèn): Asking the patient about their symptoms and medical history
- Palpation (切 qiè): Feeling the pulse and palpating body areas
- Air constitution: Characterized by changeability, creativity, and tendency towards anxiety
- Fire constitution: Characterized by intensity, leadership qualities, and tendency towards inflammation
- Water constitution: Characterized by calmness, endurance, and tendency towards coldness
- Tongue coating: The fur-like layer on the tongue surface, indicating digestive system condition
- Pulse quality: Characteristics of the pulse such as rate, rhythm, strength, and depth
