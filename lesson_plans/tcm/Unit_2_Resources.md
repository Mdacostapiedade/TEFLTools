## Four Pillars of TCM Diagnosis

### 1. Observation (望 wàng)
- Visual inspection of the patient's overall appearance
- Key areas: face, tongue, body shape, skin, and demeanor
- Tongue diagnosis: color, coating, shape, and moisture
- Facial diagnosis: complexion, eyes, lips, and overall expression

### 2. Auscultation and Olfaction (聞 wén)
- Listening to sounds: breathing, voice, coughing
- Smelling: body odor, breath, excretions
- Importance of subtle changes in sound and smell

### 3. Inquiry (問 wèn)
- Detailed questioning about symptoms and medical history
- Topics: sleep, appetite, digestion, pain, emotions, lifestyle
- Importance of open-ended questions and active listening

### 4. Palpation (切 qiè)
- Feeling the pulse at radial artery (28 pulse qualities)
- Palpating abdomen, muscles, and acupoints
- Assessing temperature and moisture of skin

## Constitution Types

### Air Constitution
- Characteristics: thin, tall, creative, anxious
- Strengths: adaptability, quick thinking
- Weaknesses: prone to worry, insomnia, dry skin

### Fire Constitution
- Characteristics: ruddy complexion, charismatic, passionate
- Strengths: leadership, enthusiasm
- Weaknesses: inflammation, hypertension, irritability

### Water Constitution
- Characteristics: rounded body, calm demeanor, good endurance
- Strengths: patience, emotional stability
- Weaknesses: edema, coldness, slow metabolism

## Tongue Diagnosis

### Color
- Pale: deficiency or cold
- Red: heat or inflammation
- Purple: blood stasis

### Coating
- Thin white: normal
- Thick white: cold or damp
- Yellow: heat
- None: yin deficiency

### Shape
- Swollen: dampness or qi deficiency
- Thin: blood or yin deficiency
- Cracked: yin deficiency or internal heat

### Moisture
- Dry: yin deficiency or internal heat
- Wet: dampness or phlegm

## Pulse Diagnosis

### Pulse Qualities
- Rate: slow, normal, rapid
- Depth: superficial, middle, deep
- Strength: weak, normal, strong
- Width: thin, normal, wide
- Length: short, normal, long
- Rhythm: regular, irregular

### Common Pulse Types
- Floating: external condition or qi deficiency
- Sinking: internal condition or excess
- Slippery: phlegm or pregnancy
- Wiry: liver qi stagnation or pain

# Discussion Questions

1. How do the four pillars of TCM diagnosis complement each other in providing a comprehensive health assessment?

2. In what ways might a patient's constitution type influence their susceptibility to certain health issues or their response to treatments?

3. How can tongue diagnosis provide insights into a patient's internal health conditions? What are its limitations?

4. Discuss the challenges of accurately reading pulse qualities. How might practitioners develop this skill?

5. How do TCM diagnostic methods differ from Western medical diagnostics? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of each approach?

6. How might cultural factors in Timor-Leste influence the application of TCM diagnostic methods?

7. In what ways can TCM diagnosis be integrated with modern medical tests for a more comprehensive health assessment?

8. How might a patient's emotional state affect their tongue and pulse diagnoses? How can practitioners account for this?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Exercise 1: Tongue Observation Journal
Keep a daily journal of your tongue observations for one week. Each day, examine your tongue in natural light and record:
- The color of your tongue body
- The thickness and color of the coating
- Any changes in shape or texture
- Your overall health, diet, and stress levels for that day

At the end of the week, write a 500-word reflection on any patterns or correlations you noticed between your tongue's appearance and your daily health/lifestyle factors.

## Exercise 2: Constitution Type Analysis
Write a 750-word essay analyzing your own constitution type. Include:
- Which type (Air, Fire, or Water) you believe you are and why
- How your constitution type manifests in your physical characteristics, personality traits, and health tendencies
- Potential imbalances or health issues you might be prone to based on your constitution
- Lifestyle and dietary recommendations that would be beneficial for your constitution type

# Assignment Details

## Practical Diagnosis Exercise
In pairs, conduct a full TCM diagnosis on your partner using the four pillars. Create a detailed report including:
1. Observations of your partner's overall appearance and demeanor
2. Notes on any sounds or smells relevant to diagnosis
3. A summary of your partner's responses to health inquiry questions
4. Detailed description of tongue and pulse diagnoses
5. Your assessment of their likely constitution type
6. A conclusion summarizing potential imbalances or health concerns based on your findings

The report should be 1000-1500 words and include a reflection on your experience applying TCM diagnostic techniques.

## Research Paper: TCM Diagnosis in Timor-Leste
Write a 2000-word research paper on the potential applications and challenges of implementing TCM diagnostic methods in Timor-Leste. Include:
- An overview of the current healthcare system in Timor-Leste
- The potential benefits of integrating TCM diagnosis into local healthcare practices
- Cultural considerations and potential barriers to adoption
- A proposed strategy for introducing TCM diagnostic training to local healthcare workers
- Case studies or examples from other Southeast Asian countries that have integrated TCM practices

# Additional Materials

## Tongue Diagnosis Chart

## Pulse Diagnosis Simulator Instructions
1. Access the online pulse simulator at [insert URL]
2. Practice identifying different pulse qualities:
   - Rate: Count beats for 15 seconds and multiply by 4
   - Depth: Notice where the pulse is strongest (superficial, middle, or deep)
   - Width: Feel how much of your fingertip the pulse occupies
   - Strength: Assess the force of the pulse against your fingertip
3. Record your findings for each simulated pulse
4. Check your accuracy against the simulator's descriptions
