## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to locate acupoints accurately.
   **Solution**: Use adhesive dots or washable markers to help students visualize point locations. Provide plenty of hands-on practice with instructor guidance.

2. **Challenge**: Cultural sensitivity regarding touch-based practices.
   **Solution**: Discuss cultural norms and comfort levels openly. Offer alternatives like self-acupressure or using tools instead of direct touch when practicing.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty understanding TCM concepts like qi and meridians.
   **Solution**: Use analogies familiar to Timorese culture, such as comparing qi flow to water in irrigation systems. Emphasize practical applications over theoretical concepts.

4. **Challenge**: Integrating TCM with local healing practices.
   **Solution**: Invite local healers as guest speakers to discuss similarities and differences. Encourage students to share their knowledge of traditional practices and find common ground.

5. **Challenge**: Ensuring safe practice of acupressure techniques.
   **Solution**: Emphasize contraindications and safety precautions throughout the lesson. Provide clear guidelines for pressure intensity and duration. Supervise practice sessions closely.

6. **Challenge**: Language barriers in understanding TCM terminology.
   **Solution**: Develop a glossary of TCM terms with Tetum translations or local equivalents. Use visual aids and demonstrations to supplement verbal explanations.
