## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Language barriers**: Prepare key terms in both English and Tetum. Use visual demonstrations whenever possible.

2. **Cultural sensitivity**: Be aware of local customs regarding touch and personal space. Adapt exercises as needed and always ask for permission before making physical adjustments.

3. **Skepticism about mind-body techniques**: Begin with a discussion about local healing traditions that incorporate mind-body elements. Emphasize the scientific evidence supporting these practices.

4. **Difficulty with meditation**: Start with very short periods of meditation (1-2 minutes) and gradually increase. Offer alternatives like walking meditation or movement-based mindfulness.

5. **Physical limitations**: Provide modifications for all Qi Gong movements. Emphasize that even small, gentle movements can be beneficial.

6. **Integrating practice at home**: Encourage students to start with just 5 minutes a day and link the practice to an existing daily habit (e.g., after brushing teeth).

7. **Addressing trauma**: Be aware that some mindfulness practices may be challenging for individuals with trauma. Offer grounding techniques and always give participants the option to open their eyes or stop the practice.

8. **Measuring progress**: Help students understand that benefits may be subtle at first. Encourage them to notice small changes in their daily life, not just in pain levels.
