## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may be skeptical about TCM concepts that differ from Western medicine.
   **Solution**: Provide scientific studies supporting TCM practices where available, and emphasize the complementary nature of TCM to conventional treatments.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in adapting TCM practices to local Timorese culture and resources.
   **Solution**: Encourage students to brainstorm local alternatives for herbs or practices, and invite local healers as guest speakers to discuss integration.

3. **Challenge**: Students struggling to maintain new self-care routines.
   **Solution**: Implement a buddy system for accountability and schedule regular check-ins to discuss progress and challenges.

4. **Challenge**: Language barriers in understanding TCM terminology.
   **Solution**: Create a glossary of TCM terms with Tetum translations and simple explanations. Use visual aids to reinforce concepts.

5. **Challenge**: Limited access to TCM resources or practitioners in Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Develop a resource list of available practitioners, online resources, and community programs. Encourage students to form study groups or practice circles.

6. **Challenge**: Resistance to touch-based therapies due to cultural norms.
   **Solution**: Discuss cultural sensitivities openly, offer alternatives like self-acupressure, and ensure proper consent and comfort levels are maintained during practice sessions.
