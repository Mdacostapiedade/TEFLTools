## Sample Case Study

Maria, a 45-year-old woman from a rural village in Timor-Leste, has been experiencing chronic back pain for several years.

The community health worker wants to introduce TCM techniques to help Maria manage her pain.

Consider:

- How would you integrate these techniques with her current pain management strategies?
- What cultural factors should be considered in developing a treatment plan?
