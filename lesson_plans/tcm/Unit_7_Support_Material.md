## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

   **Tip**: Encourage open discussion about the strengths and limitations of both approaches. Use case studies that demonstrate successful integration.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in adapting TCM concepts to local Timorese context.
   **Tip**: Invite local healers as guest speakers to discuss parallels between TCM and Timorese healing traditions. Encourage students to create "translation" guides for key concepts.

3. **Challenge**: Limited resources for practical demonstrations of TCM techniques.
   **Tip**: Utilize online resources, such as video demonstrations. Encourage students to practice simple techniques like acupressure on themselves or classmates.

4. **Challenge**: Varying levels of cultural competence among students.
   **Tip**: Incorporate regular self-reflection exercises. Use role-play scenarios to practice culturally sensitive communication.

5. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with designing community workshops.
   **Tip**: Provide examples of successful community health initiatives. Offer a structured brainstorming session to help generate ideas before the main activity.
