# Excerpts and Short Stories

## "The Nature of Being" by Maria da Costa (local Timorese author)

In the hills of Timor-Leste, where the mist clings to the mountains like a soft blanket, old Avó Marta sits cross-legged on her woven mat. Her eyes, though clouded with age, seem to pierce through the veil of reality as she speaks of the nature of being.

"Child," she says to her young granddaughter, "to understand who you are, you must first understand that you are not separate from the world around you. The air you breathe, the earth beneath your feet, the spirits of our ancestors – all of these are part of you, and you are part of them."

She picks up a small stone from the ground and holds it in her weathered palm. "See this stone? It has been here long before us and will remain long after. Yet, in this moment, it is connected to us. Feel its coolness, its weight. It is teaching us about permanence and change, about the nature of existence itself."

The old woman closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. "Now, listen to the wind in the trees, the birds singing their morning songs. These sounds arise in your consciousness, just as your thoughts do. They are all expressions of the same divine essence that flows through everything."

She opens her eyes and smiles at her granddaughter. "To truly know yourself, you must look beyond what you think you are – beyond your name, your body, your thoughts. Look to that which is aware of all these things. That awareness, that consciousness, is your true nature. It is the divine spark within you, and it connects you to all of creation."

As the sun rises higher, casting long shadows across the hillside, Avó Marta's words hang in the air, an invitation to explore the depths of being and the interconnectedness of all things in the rich spiritual tapestry of Timor-Leste.

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Writing on Individual Understanding of Self and Divinity

1. Find a quiet space where you can reflect without interruption. You may wish to light a candle or play soft background music to create a contemplative atmosphere.

2. Take a few deep breaths to center yourself. As you breathe, bring your attention to your sense of "being" – the simple fact of your existence in this moment.

3. On a blank page, write at the top: "My understanding of self and divinity."

4. For the next 20 minutes, write continuously about your personal understanding of who you are (your sense of self) and your relationship to the divine or the greater universe. Consider the following prompts:

   - How do you define your "self"? Is it your body, your thoughts, your feelings, or something else?
   - What does the concept of divinity mean to you? How do you relate to or experience it?
   - How have your cultural background and life experiences shaped your understanding of self and divinity?
   - In what ways do you feel connected to something greater than yourself?
   - Are there moments when you've felt a sense of unity or oneness with the world around you? Describe these experiences.
   - How do your beliefs about self and divinity influence your daily life and decisions?

5. Don't worry about perfect grammar or structure. The goal is to explore your thoughts and feelings freely.

6. After 20 minutes, read over what you've written. Underline or circle any insights or ideas that stand out to you.

7. Take a few moments to reflect on the writing process. Did any new understandings or questions arise?

8. In a different color pen, add a short paragraph summarizing your main reflections and any questions you're left with.

9. Be prepared to share some of your insights (only what you're comfortable with) in the next class discussion.
