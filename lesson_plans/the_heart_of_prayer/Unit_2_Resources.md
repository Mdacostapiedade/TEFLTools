# Resources for Learning Unit 2: Prayer as a Practice of Self-Realization

## 1. Text Excerpts

### From "The Heart of Prayer" by Rupert Spira (Tetum translation)

> Orasaun la'ós deit atu husu buat ruma ba Maromak. Nia mós dalan ida atu hatene ita nia an loloos. Bainhira ita halo orasaun ho laran tomak, ita bele sente katak ita nia moris nee ligadu ho buat hotu iha mundu. Iha momentu nee, ita bele komprende katak ita la'ós deit ema ida nebe iha limitasaun, maibé ita mós parte ida husi buat nebe boot liu fali ita nia hanoin bele taka.

(English translation: Prayer is not just asking God for something. It is also a way to know our true self. When we pray wholeheartedly, we can feel that our life is connected to everything in the world. In this moment, we can understand that we are not just limited individuals, but also part of something greater than our thoughts can grasp.)

### From "Timorese Spiritual Traditions" (author to be sourced)

> Iha Timor-Leste nia kultura, orasaun iha ligasaun forte ho bei-ala sira. Bainhira ema Timor halo orasaun, sira la koalia deit ho Maromak, maibé mós ho sira nia bei-ala sira. Prátika ida nee hatudu katak moris nee la'ós deit kona ba ita nia an, maibé mós kona ba ita nia ligasaun ho jerasaun uluk no oin.

(English translation: In Timorese culture, prayer has a strong connection to ancestors. When Timorese people pray, they are not only speaking to God but also to their ancestors. This practice shows that life is not just about oneself, but also about our connection to past and future generations.)

## 2. Lecture Notes

### The Concept of Prayer in Timorese Catholicism and Indigenous Beliefs

1. Timorese Catholicism
   - Influence of Portuguese colonization
   - Syncretism with indigenous beliefs
   - Formal prayer structures (e.g., rosary, novenas)
   - Importance of Mary and saints in Timorese Catholic prayer

2. Indigenous Timorese beliefs
   - Animistic traditions
   - Role of lulik (sacred) in prayer practices
   - Communal nature of indigenous prayer
   - Connection to land and ancestors in prayer

3. Similarities and differences
   - Both emphasize community and collective prayer
   - Indigenous practices more focused on nature and ancestors
   - Catholic prayers often more structured and text-based
   - Both can involve offerings and rituals

### Prayer as a Tool for Self-Realization and Union with the Divine

1. Self-realization through prayer
   - Prayer as introspection and self-reflection
   - Quieting the mind to reveal inner truths
   - Recognizing one's place in the larger cosmos

2. Union with the divine
   - Concept of oneness in Timorese spirituality
   - Breaking down perceived barriers between self and divine
   - Experiences of transcendence in deep prayer

3. Timorese perspectives on self and divine unity
   - Influence of animistic beliefs on concepts of divine presence
   - Catholic teachings on personal relationship with God
   - Integration of ancestor veneration in understanding of divine unity

### Comparative Study of Prayer Practices in Timor-Leste

1. Catholic prayer practices
   - Mass and Eucharist
   - Rosary and Marian devotions
   - Novenas and saint veneration

2. Indigenous prayer practices
   - Tara bandu ceremonies
   - Ancestor communication rituals
   - Nature-based prayers and offerings

3. Syncretic practices
