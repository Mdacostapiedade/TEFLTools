# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from "The Heart of Prayer" by Rupert Spira (Chapter 2)

"The 'I' that we use in everyday language to refer to ourselves is not just a word or a concept. It is the name we give to our most intimate experience of being aware or present. It is our first and most fundamental experience.

When we refer to ourselves as 'I,' we are referring to the aware presence that is reading these words. That aware presence is not an object, a body, or a mind. It is that which is aware of our body, thoughts, and perceptions. It is pure awareness itself.

In spiritual traditions, this 'I' is considered the true divine name because it points directly to our essential nature, which is identical to the ultimate reality or God. By deeply contemplating the 'I,' we can discover its true nature as infinite, eternal awareness."

## Guided Meditation Script: Exploring the "I"

Find a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, allowing your body to relax.

Now, bring your attention to the simple feeling of being present. Notice that you are aware, conscious, here.

Gently ask yourself, "Who or what is aware of my experience right now?" Don't try to answer with thoughts, but simply rest in the questioning.

Notice that whatever appears in your experience – thoughts, sensations, sounds – is known by this aware presence that you call "I."

Repeat the word "I" silently to yourself a few times. With each repetition, feel into the reality that this word points to.

Notice that this "I" is not a thought or a feeling, but the aware space in which all thoughts and feelings appear.

Rest in this awareness, allowing everything to be as it is.

If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the sense of being aware, of being "I."

(Allow 5-10 minutes of silent meditation)

Slowly bring your attention back to your surroundings. When you're ready, open your eyes.
