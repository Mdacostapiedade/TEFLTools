## The Pitfalls of Seeking the Divine as an External Object

### Introduction
- Objectification of the divine is a common human tendency
- Rooted in our need to understand and relate to abstract concepts
- Prevalent in many religious and spiritual traditions, including Timorese

### Historical and Cultural Context
- Ancient polytheistic religions often depicted gods as human-like entities
- Monotheistic traditions sometimes describe God with human attributes
- Timorese animistic beliefs attribute spirits to natural objects and phenomena

### Limitations of Divine Objectification
1. Creates artificial separation
   - Reinforces dualistic thinking (self vs. divine)
   - May lead to feelings of disconnection or unworthiness
2. Limits understanding of divine nature
   - Reduces infinite possibilities to finite concepts
   - May oversimplify complex spiritual truths
3. Anthropomorphism
   - Attributing human characteristics to the divine
   - Can lead to literal interpretations of metaphorical teachings
4. Attachment to form
   - Focusing on external representations rather than inner experience
   - May hinder direct spiritual realization
5. Exclusivity
   - Can foster religious intolerance or superiority complexes
   - May prevent recognition of divine presence in all things

### Timorese Examples
- Traditional belief in Maromak (supreme being) sometimes depicted with human qualities
- Catholic imagery of saints and Mary, potentially objectifying divine intermediaries
- Sacred objects (lulik) in animistic practices, possibly limiting divine to specific items

## Non-dualistic Perspectives in Timorese Spiritual Traditions

### Introduction to Non-dualism
- Philosophy that sees no fundamental separation between self and divine
- Emphasizes unity and interconnectedness of all existence

### Indigenous Timorese Non-dualistic Elements
1. Animistic worldview
   - Spirit present in all things, blurring lines between sacred and profane
   - Interconnectedness of humans, nature, and spiritual realm
2. Ancestor veneration
   - Continuity between living and dead, transcending individual existence
   - Ancestors as part of the broader spiritual fabric of reality
3. Concept of lulik (sacred power)
   - Pervasive spiritual force not limited to specific objects or beings
   - Emphasis on the sacred nature of all existence

### Catholic Influences on Timorese Non-dualism
1. Mystical traditions within Catholicism
   - Teachings of unity with God (e.g., St. John of the Cross, Teresa of Avila)
   - Concept of imago dei (humans made in God's image)
2. Liberation theology
   - Emphasis on God's presence in the struggle for justice and freedom
   - Blurring of lines between sacred and secular action

### Syncretic Practices
- Blending of Catholic and indigenous beliefs creating unique non-dualistic perspectives
- Example: Incorporation of traditional rituals into Catholic ceremonies

### Challenges in Reconciling Traditional Beliefs with Non-dualistic Approaches
1. Deeply ingrained dualistic thinking from both indigenous and colonial influences
2. Potential conflict with official Catholic doctrine
3. Balancing respect for tradition with evolving spiritual understanding
4. Navigating between personal experience and communal religious practices

# Discussion Questions

1. How do you personally relate to or conceptualize the divine? Do you tend to objectify it, and if so, how?
2. What are some potential benefits of objectifying the divine? How do these compare with the limitations we discussed?
3. Can you think of examples from Timorese culture where the divine is treated as an object? How does this impact spiritual practice?
4. How might a non-dualistic approach to spirituality change one's daily life and interactions with others?
5. In what ways do Timorese indigenous beliefs reflect non-dualistic perspectives? How do these compare with non-dualistic elements in Catholicism?
6. How can we reconcile traditional religious practices that may objectify the divine with a more non-dualistic understanding?
7. What challenges might arise when trying to adopt a non-dualistic spiritual perspective in a predominantly dualistic society?
8. How might the concept of non-dualism contribute to interfaith dialogue and understanding in Timor-Leste?
9. Can you think of any personal experiences that have led you to question dualistic thinking in your own spiritual life?
10. How might a non-dualistic approach to spirituality impact Timorese society's approach to social and environmental issues?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Essay: Personal Experience with Divine Objectification and Non-dualism

1. Begin by describing a personal experience or practice where you have objectified the divine. This could be through prayer, visualization, or participation in a religious ceremony.

2. Reflect on how this objectification has influenced your spiritual journey. What benefits or limitations have you encountered?

3. Now, consider a moment when you've had a sense of unity or non-separation from the divine. This might be during meditation, in nature, or in a moment of profound realization. Describe this experience in detail.

4. Compare and contrast these two experiences. How did they differ in terms of your emotional state, sense of connection, and understanding of the divine?

5. Explore how Timorese spiritual traditions (either indigenous or Catholic) have influenced your understanding of the divine. Are there elements of non-dualism in these traditions that resonate with you?

6. Conclude by reflecting on how you might integrate both perspectives (objectification and non-dualism) in your spiritual practice moving forward. What challenges do you anticipate, and what potential benefits do you see?

## Case Study: The Tara Bandu Ceremony

The Tara Bandu is a traditional Timorese practice that involves placing a ritual prohibition on certain activities, often related to natural resource management. This ceremony offers an interesting case study in the interplay between objectification of the divine and non-dualistic perspectives:

1. Objectification elements:
   - Use of sacred objects (lulik) in the ceremony
   - Invocation of specific spirits or ancestors

2. Non-dualistic elements:
   - Recognition of the interconnectedness of human actions and natural harmony
   - Blurring of lines between spiritual and ecological concerns

3. Questions for consideration:
   - How does Tara Bandu reflect both dualistic and non-dualistic thinking?
   - In what ways might this practice be evolving in contemporary Timorese society?
   - How can the principles of Tara Bandu inform a more non-dualistic approach to environmental stewardship?
