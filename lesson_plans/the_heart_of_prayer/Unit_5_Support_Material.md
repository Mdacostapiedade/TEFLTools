## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have strong personal religious beliefs that conflict with non-dualistic concepts.
   **Solution**: Emphasize that the course is about exploring different perspectives, not about changing personal beliefs. Encourage respectful dialogue and create a safe space for diverse viewpoints.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in grasping abstract concepts of non-dualism.
   **Solution**: Use concrete examples and analogies from everyday life. Incorporate experiential exercises like meditation to help students intuitively understand non-dualistic perspectives.

3. **Challenge**: Limited resources on Timorese spiritual traditions in academic literature.
   **Solution**: Encourage students to conduct primary research through interviews with local elders and spiritual leaders. Collaborate with other educational institutions in Timor-Leste to share resources.

4. **Challenge**: Language barriers when discussing complex spiritual concepts.
   **Solution**: Provide a comprehensive glossary of terms in both English and Tetum. Work with local language experts to ensure accurate translations of key concepts.

5. **Challenge**: Balancing academic rigor with respect for traditional beliefs.
   **Solution**: Frame discussions in terms of cultural exploration rather than critical analysis. Invite local spiritual leaders as guest speakers to provide authentic perspectives.

6. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to relate abstract spiritual concepts to their daily lives.
   **Solution**: Incorporate practical applications and discussions about how these concepts can inform ethical decision-making and community engagement in Timorese society.
