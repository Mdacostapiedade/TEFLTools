# Excerpts and Short Stories

## "The Sacred Silence" by Maria da Costa (local Timorese author)

In the heart of the mountains, where the mist clings to the trees like a veil, there stands an uma lulik. Its weathered wooden beams have witnessed countless generations come and go, each leaving their mark in the whispered prayers that seem to echo within its walls.

Old Mau Leki sits cross-legged on the cool earthen floor, his eyes closed, his weathered hands resting gently on his knees. The scent of sandalwood incense curls around him, a fragrant offering to the ancestors whose presence he feels in every breath.

As the first rays of dawn filter through the thatched roof, Mau Leki begins to chant softly. The ancient words, passed down through countless generations, flow from his lips like water over smooth stones. With each syllable, he feels himself sinking deeper into the silence that lies beneath all sound.

In this sacred space, time seems to stand still. The boundaries between past and present, between the visible and invisible worlds, begin to blur. Mau Leki's awareness expands, encompassing the entire uma lulik, the surrounding forest, the very mountain itself.

And in that moment of profound connection, he understands. The true nature of being is not something to be sought or grasped, but simply recognized as the ever-present reality that underlies all experience. It is the silence from which all sound arises, the emptiness that gives birth to all form.

As the sun climbs higher in the sky, Mau Leki slowly opens his eyes. The world around him seems somehow brighter, more vivid. He rises, bows to the ancestral altar, and steps out into the day, carrying the peace of the uma lulik within his heart.

## Guided Meditation Script: Timorese Mountain Contemplation

Find a comfortable seated position, either on a cushion or a chair. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, allowing your body to relax and settle.

Imagine yourself sitting on the slopes of Mount Ramelau, the highest peak in Timor-Leste. Feel the cool mountain air on your skin, and the solid earth beneath you.

As you breathe in, visualize the mist rising from the valleys below, carrying the essence of the land. As you breathe out, feel yourself becoming more grounded and connected to the mountain.

Listen to the sounds around you – perhaps the rustle of leaves in the breeze, or the distant call of birds. Let these sounds come and go without holding onto them.

Now, bring your attention to the space around your heart. Imagine a warm, gentle light growing there, filled with the wisdom of your ancestors. With each breath, feel this light expanding, encompassing your entire body.

As the light grows, see it extending beyond your body, connecting you to the trees, the rocks, the very mountain itself. Feel the boundary between yourself and the natural world beginning to dissolve.

In this state of connection, bring to mind a challenge or question you're facing in your life. Without trying to solve or analyze it, simply hold it in your awareness, allowing the wisdom of the mountain and your ancestors to inform your perspective.

Take a few moments to rest in this space of expanded awareness and connection.

When you're ready, slowly bring your attention back to your body, feeling the points of contact with the ground. Take a deep breath, and gently open your eyes, carrying the peace and wisdom of the mountain with you.

## Example of Tara Bandu Ceremony Related to Meditation Practice

The community gathers in the village center, where the lia-na'in (traditional leader) stands before a freshly planted tree. This tree represents the community's commitment to preserving the nearby sacred forest, which serves as a site for nature-based meditation practices.

The lia-na'in begins by calling upon the ancestors and nature spirits to witness the ceremony. He then explains the tara bandu (traditional law) being established: for the next year, no trees may be cut in the sacred forest, and all community members are encouraged to spend time in quiet contemplation among the ancient trees.

As part of the ceremony, each family brings a small stone, which they place around the base of the newly planted tree. As they do so, they silently set an intention for their own meditation practice and for the well-being of the community.

The lia-na'in then leads the gathered community in a group meditation, focusing on the interconnectedness of all life and the importance of maintaining harmony with nature. The ceremony concludes with traditional songs and a shared meal, reinforcing the communal aspect of both environmental stewardship and spiritual practice.

This tara bandu ceremony demonstrates how traditional Timorese practices can integrate environmental conservation, community cohesion, and individual spiritual development through meditation.
