# Lesson Plan: Introduction to the Human Microbiome

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Computer with projector
- Printed handouts of key microbiome diagrams
- Colored pencils or markers for student activities
- "I Contain Multitudes" by Ed Yong (one copy per student)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define the human microbiome and explain its importance
- Identify the main locations of microbial communities in the human body
- Describe the historical context of microbiome research
- Discuss local perceptions of microbes in Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to write down 3 words they associate with "microbes" or "bacteria"
- Have students share their words with a partner
- Collect responses on the whiteboard and briefly discuss common themes

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Microbiome
- Microbiota
- Commensal
- Symbiosis
- Metagenomics

Use visual aids and simple analogies to reinforce understanding.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Define the human microbiome
   - Explain the concept of humans as "superorganisms"
   - Discuss the ratio of microbial to human cells

2. Overview of microbial diversity in the human body
   - Highlight main locations: gut, skin, oral cavity, etc.
   - Introduce key microbial players (e.g., Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes)

3. Historical context of microbiome research
   - Discuss early microbiologists (e.g., Leeuwenhoek, Pasteur)
   - Explain the impact of DNA sequencing technologies
   - Introduce the Human Microbiome Project

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

1. Body mapping activity:
   - In small groups, students draw an outline of the human body
   - Label major microbiome sites and list key microbial groups

2. Timeline creation:
   - Provide key events in microbiome research history
   - Students arrange events chronologically on a timeline

## 7. Production Task (25 minutes)

Group discussion on local perceptions of microbes in Timor-Leste:
- Divide class into small groups
- Each group discusses:
  1. Traditional beliefs about microbes in Timor-Leste
  2. Common practices related to hygiene and fermented foods
  3. How these perceptions might impact health behaviors
- Groups present their findings to the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Conduct a brief quiz using an online platform (e.g., Kahoot)
- Review key points of the lesson
- Address any remaining questions

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Read Chapter 1 of "I Contain Multitudes" by Ed Yong
2. Create a visual representation of microbiome diversity:
   - Choose a body site (gut, skin, mouth, etc.)
   - Research and illustrate the microbial diversity of that site
   - Include at least 5 different types of microbes and their relative abundances

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Microbiome: The collective genomes of microorganisms that reside in an environmental niche
- Microbiota: The community of microorganisms themselves
- Commensal: A relationship between two organisms where one benefits and the other is unaffected
- Symbiosis: A close and long-term biological interaction between two different biological organisms
- Metagenomics: The study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples
