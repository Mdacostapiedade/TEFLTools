# Support Material for Microbiome Research Techniques Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **16S rRNA gene**: A highly conserved gene in bacteria used for taxonomic classification
- **Metagenomics**: The study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples
- **Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU)**: A cluster of similar 16S rRNA sequences used as a proxy for microbial "species"
- **Bioinformatics**: The use of computational tools to analyze biological data
- **Amplicon sequencing**: A technique that involves sequencing a specific DNA region, such as the 16S rRNA gene
- **Alpha diversity**: A measure of the diversity of species within a single sample
- **Beta diversity**: A measure of the difference in species composition between samples
- **Shotgun sequencing**: A method that involves randomly sequencing DNA fragments from a mixed community of organisms
- **Taxonomic classification**: The process of assigning organisms to specific taxonomic groups based on their genetic or physical characteristics
- **Functional analysis**: The study of the metabolic capabilities and activities of microorganisms in a community

## 5. Tips for Teachers

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with bioinformatics concepts
   - **Solution**: Provide hands-on practice with user-friendly tools like Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org/) for microbiome analysis

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty relating microbiome research to local context
   - **Solution**: Invite local health professionals or researchers to discuss ongoing projects or health issues in Timor-Leste

3. **Challenge**: Limited access to advanced sequencing technology
   - **Solution**: Focus on data analysis and interpretation using publicly available datasets; consider virtual lab tours of sequencing facilities

4. **Challenge**: Students overwhelmed by the amount of new information
   - **Solution**: Break down complex topics into smaller, manageable chunks; use analogies relevant to local culture to explain difficult concepts

5. **Challenge**: Engaging students with diverse academic backgrounds
   - **Solution**: Implement peer teaching strategies; pair students with complementary skills for group activities

Remember to adapt these materials to the specific needs and context of your students in Timor-Leste, incorporating local examples and health priorities whenever possible.
