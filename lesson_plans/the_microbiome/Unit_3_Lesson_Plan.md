# Lesson Plan: The Gut Microbiome

## 1. Resources Needed

- Textbook: "I Contain Multitudes" by Ed Yong
- Scientific papers on gut microbiome research (provided digitally)
- Computer with internet access and projector
- Whiteboard and markers
- Poster-making materials (large paper, markers, colored pencils)
- Handouts with typical Timorese diets

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe the composition and functions of the gut microbiome
- Explain the role of diet in shaping the gut microbiome
- Analyze the relationship between Timorese diets and gut microbiome health
- Create an educational poster on gut health for local communities

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Ask students to write down everything they ate yesterday
- In pairs, have students discuss how they think their diet might affect their gut microbes

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Microbiome
- Gut flora
- Probiotics
- Prebiotics
- Fermentation
- Dysbiosis

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of gut microbiome composition
  * Key bacterial phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria
  * Diversity and abundance of microbes in the gut
- Functions of the gut microbiome
  * Nutrient metabolism
  * Immune system regulation
  * Protection against pathogens
  * Production of beneficial compounds (e.g., short-chain fatty acids)
- Factors influencing gut microbiome health
  * Diet
  * Antibiotics
  * Stress
  * Exercise
  * Environmental factors
- Role of diet in shaping the gut microbiome
  * Impact of fiber, protein, and fat intake
  * Importance of diverse plant-based foods
  * Effects of processed foods and artificial additives
- Gut microbiome and nutrition in Timor-Leste
  * Traditional Timorese diet and its potential benefits
  * Challenges with nutrition and food security
  * Opportunities for improving gut health through local foods

## 6. Practice Activities (20 minutes)

- In small groups, students analyze handouts with typical Timorese diets
- Groups discuss and list potential positive and negative impacts on the gut microbiome
- Class comes together to share findings and create a collective list on the whiteboard

## 7. Production Task (40 minutes)

- Students work in pairs to design an educational poster on gut health for local communities
- Posters should include:
  * Basic information about the gut microbiome
  * Tips for maintaining a healthy gut microbiome
  * Examples of local foods that promote gut health
  * Simple explanations suitable for a general audience

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students answer true/false questions about the gut microbiome
- Recap key points of the lesson
- Address any remaining questions from students

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Read the chapter on the gut microbiome in "I Contain Multitudes"
- Write a 500-word reflection on how students could improve their own diet to support gut health, incorporating local Timorese foods

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Microbiome: The collection of all microorganisms living in and on the human body
- Gut flora: The community of microorganisms living in the digestive tract
- Probiotics: Live microorganisms that, when consumed, provide health benefits
- Prebiotics: Non-digestible food components that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria
- Fermentation: The process by which microorganisms break down carbohydrates, often producing beneficial compounds
- Dysbiosis: An imbalance in the microbial community, often associated with disease states
