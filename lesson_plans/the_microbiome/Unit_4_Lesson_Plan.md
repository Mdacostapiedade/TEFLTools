# Lesson Plan: Microbiome and Immune System

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer
- Whiteboard and markers
- Printed handouts of case studies
- Access to scientific journals for research
- Poster-making materials (large paper, markers, etc.)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the relationship between the microbiome and immune function
- Discuss the impact of the microbiome on infectious disease susceptibility and severity
- Analyze case studies of infectious diseases relevant to Timor-Leste in relation to the microbiome
- Develop a public health message about microbiome and immunity for local dissemination

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students answer true/false questions about the immune system and microbiome
- Class discussion of answers, addressing any misconceptions

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

- Introduce and define key terms:
  - Colonization resistance
  - Immune tolerance
  - Pathobionts
  - Mucosal immunity
  - Microbiome-immune axis
- Students create a vocabulary map linking these terms

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (40 minutes)

- Lecture on the microbiome's role in immune development:
  - Early life colonization and immune system maturation
  - Microbiome's influence on innate and adaptive immunity
  - Concept of colonization resistance against pathogens
- Discussion of the impact on infectious disease:
  - How microbiome composition affects susceptibility
  - Examples of microbiome-mediated protection against infections
  - Potential for microbiome-based therapies in infectious diseases
- Overview of relevant case studies in Timor-Leste:
  - Tuberculosis and the lung microbiome
  - Malaria and the gut microbiome
  - Soil-transmitted helminths and microbial interactions

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Small group work: Students analyze a provided case study on an infectious disease prevalent in Timor-Leste
- Groups identify potential microbiome-immune system interactions and discuss implications for prevention or treatment

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

- Group presentation preparation:
  - Students choose an infectious disease relevant to Timor-Leste
  - Research the relationship between the chosen disease and the microbiome
  - Prepare a 5-minute presentation for the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick recap of key points from the lesson
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Preview of next class's public health message development activity

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students to complete research for their group presentations
- Individual assignment: Write a one-page summary of how the microbiome influences the immune response to a specific pathogen of their choice

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Colonization resistance: The ability of the microbiome to prevent colonization by pathogenic microorganisms
- Immune tolerance: The immune system's lack of response to substances or tissues that have the potential to elicit an immune response
- Pathobionts: Symbiotic microorganisms that can cause disease under certain circumstances
- Mucosal immunity: Immune responses that occur at mucosal surfaces of the body
- Microbiome-immune axis: The bidirectional communication between the microbiome and the immune system
