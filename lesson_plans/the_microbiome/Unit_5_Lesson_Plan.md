# Lesson Plan: Environmental Influences on the Microbiome

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer
- Water quality testing kits
- Maps of Timor-Leste showing urban and rural areas
- Handouts on common water contaminants
- Samples of water from different sources (if possible)
- Poster-making materials (large paper, markers, etc.)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify at least three environmental factors that affect the human microbiome
- Explain how water quality impacts microbial communities in the body
- Compare and contrast urban and rural microbiome differences
- Design an intervention to improve an environmental factor affecting the microbiome in Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Show students images of different water sources in Timor-Leste (e.g., well, river, tap)
- Ask students to discuss in pairs:
  1. Which water source would they prefer to drink from?
  2. What might be living in each water source that we can't see?
- Share responses as a class, introducing the idea that water contains microbes

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Write the following terms on the board and briefly explain each:
- Microbiome
- Sanitation
- Water quality
- Pathogens
- Biodiversity
- Environmental exposure

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Water Quality and the Microbiome
- Explain how water acts as a vector for microorganisms
- Discuss common waterborne pathogens in Timor-Leste
- Explain how clean water supports a healthy microbiome

### Sanitation Practices and Microbial Exposure
- Discuss the relationship between sanitation and microbial diversity
- Explain the hygiene hypothesis and its relevance to Timor-Leste
- Highlight the importance of balanced microbial exposure for immune development

### Urban vs. Rural Microbiome Differences
- Present research findings on urban/rural microbiome variations
- Discuss factors contributing to these differences (e.g., diet, lifestyle, environmental exposure)
- Relate these differences to the context of Timor-Leste's urban and rural areas

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Activity 1: Water Quality Testing
- Divide students into groups
- Provide each group with water samples and testing kits
- Have students test and compare water quality from different sources
- Discuss how water quality might impact the microbiome

### Activity 2: Urban vs. Rural Comparison
- Using maps of Timor-Leste, have students identify urban and rural areas
- In groups, create Venn diagrams comparing environmental factors in urban and rural settings
- Discuss how these factors might influence the microbiome

## 7. Production Task (40 minutes)

### Design an Environmental Intervention
- In groups, students design an intervention to improve an environmental factor affecting the microbiome in Timor-Leste
- Each group focuses on one area: water quality, sanitation, or urban/rural differences
- Groups create a poster outlining their intervention, including:
  1. Problem identification
  2. Proposed solution
  3. Expected impact on the microbiome
  4. Implementation challenges
- Groups present their posters to the class

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points about environmental influences on the microbiome
- Ask students to share one new thing they learned and one question they still have
- Preview the upcoming field trip to compare water sources

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Students write a 1-page reflection on how their daily environment might be impacting their microbiome
- Students research one traditional Timorese practice and hypothesize how it might influence the microbiome

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Microbiome: The collection of all microorganisms living in association with the human body
- Sanitation: Conditions relating to public health, especially the provision of clean drinking water and adequate sewage disposal
- Water quality: The chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water, usually in respect to its suitability for a particular purpose
- Pathogens: Microorganisms that can cause disease
- Biodiversity: The variety of life in a particular habitat or ecosystem
- Environmental exposure: Contact with environmental factors that may influence health or disease risk
