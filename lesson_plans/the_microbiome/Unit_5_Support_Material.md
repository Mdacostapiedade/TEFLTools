# Support Material for Environmental Influences on the Microbiome Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Microbiome**: The collection of all microorganisms living in association with the human body.
- **Sanitation**: Conditions relating to public health, especially the provision of clean drinking water and adequate sewage disposal.
- **Water quality**: The chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water, usually in respect to its suitability for a particular purpose.
- **Pathogens**: Microorganisms that can cause disease.
- **Biodiversity**: The variety of life in a particular habitat or ecosystem.
- **Environmental exposure**: Contact with environmental factors that may influence health or disease risk.
- **Hygiene hypothesis**: The idea that a lack of early childhood exposure to certain microorganisms increases susceptibility to allergic diseases.
- **Vector**: An organism that transmits a disease or parasite from one animal or plant to another.
- **Waterborne pathogens**: Disease-causing microorganisms that can be transmitted through water.
- **Microbial diversity**: The variety of microorganisms present in a given environment.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Water Source Comparison Diagram**
   - Description: A side-by-side comparison of three water sources common in Timor-Leste (well, river, tap), with illustrations of visible and microscopic contents.

2. **Urban vs. Rural Microbiome Infographic**
   - Description: A visual representation of how urban and rural environments in Timor-Leste differ in terms of factors affecting the microbiome (e.g., air quality, diet, exposure to nature).

3. **Sanitation Practices Impact Flowchart**
   - Description: A flowchart showing how different sanitation practices influence microbial exposure and ultimately affect the human microbiome.

4. **Water Quality Testing Results Chart**
   - Description: A chart template for students to record and compare water quality test results from different sources.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Common Waterborne Pathogens in Timor-Leste**
   - Content: List of common waterborne pathogens found in Timor-Leste, their effects on human health, and prevention methods.

2. **Urban vs. Rural Comparison Worksheet**
   - Content: Venn diagram template for students to compare environmental factors in urban and rural settings, with prompts for discussion on microbiome impacts.

3. **Environmental Intervention Design Guide**
   - Content: Step-by-step guide for students to design their environmental intervention, including sections for problem identification, proposed solution, expected impact, and implementation challenges.

4. **Reflection Questions on Personal Microbiome Influences**
   - Content: A set of questions to guide students in reflecting on how their daily environment might be impacting their microbiome.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited prior knowledge about microorganisms and their impact on health.
   - **Solution**: Start with basic concepts and gradually build complexity. Use relatable examples from daily life in Timor-Leste.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to water quality testing equipment.
   - **Solution**: Consider using simple, low-cost testing methods or visual observations. Alternatively, use hypothetical data for analysis.

3. **Challenge**: Students may hold misconceptions about hygiene and cleanliness.
   - **Solution**: Address misconceptions directly and sensitively. Emphasize the importance of balanced microbial exposure rather than extreme cleanliness.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in visualizing microscopic organisms.
   - **Solution**: Use analogies, animations, or scaled-up models to help students conceptualize microorganisms and their interactions.

5. **Challenge**: Connecting abstract microbiome concepts to local health issues.
   - **Solution**: Consistently relate microbiome topics to specific health challenges in Timor-Leste. Invite local health workers or community members to share experiences.

6. **Challenge**: Language barriers in understanding scientific terms.
   - **Solution**: Provide a glossary of key terms in both English and Tetum. Use visual aids to support explanations of complex concepts.

7. **Challenge**: Limited internet access for additional research.
   - **Solution**: Prepare printed resources or downloadable materials in advance. Encourage group work to share available resources.

8. **Challenge**: Varying levels of sanitation knowledge among students.
   - **Solution**: Conduct a pre-lesson survey to assess knowledge levels and adjust content accordingly. Use peer teaching to leverage students with more advanced understanding.
