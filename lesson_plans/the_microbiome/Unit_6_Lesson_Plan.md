# Lesson Plan: Microbiome in Maternal and Child Health

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer
- Whiteboard and markers
- Printed handouts on pregnancy and infant microbiome development
- Art supplies (poster paper, markers, colored pencils)
- Sample educational materials on maternal health

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe key changes in the microbiome during pregnancy
- Explain the process of infant microbiome development
- Discuss the impact of breastfeeding on the microbiome
- Create culturally appropriate educational materials for expectant mothers in Timor-Leste
- Analyze local birth practices and their potential effects on the infant microbiome

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share: Students reflect on what they know about pregnancy and infant development, then share with a partner and finally with the class.
- Instructor lists key points on the whiteboard, highlighting areas related to microbiome health.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Vaginal microbiome
- Vertical transmission
- Colonization
- Gut-brain axis
- Colostrum

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Microbiome Changes During Pregnancy
- Shifts in vaginal microbiome composition
- Increased diversity in gut microbiome
- Potential impacts on maternal health

### Infant Microbiome Development
- Initial colonization during birth
- Differences between vaginal and cesarean delivery
- Rapid changes in the first year of life

### Breastfeeding and the Microbiome
- Composition of breast milk microbiome
- Transfer of beneficial bacteria to infant
- Impact on infant immune system development

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Group Discussion: Divide class into small groups to discuss potential challenges for maintaining a healthy microbiome during pregnancy in Timor-Leste.

2. Case Study Analysis: Provide students with anonymized case studies of different birth scenarios in Timor-Leste. Students analyze potential impacts on infant microbiome development.

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

1. Create Educational Materials: 
   - Students work in pairs to design a poster or brochure for expectant mothers in Timor-Leste about microbiome health during pregnancy and early infancy.
   - Materials should be culturally appropriate and address local practices and beliefs.

2. Birth Practice Analysis:
   - In small groups, students research and analyze common birth practices in Timor-Leste.
   - Groups present their findings and discuss potential impacts on the infant microbiome.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion: Share key takeaways from the educational material creation and birth practice analysis.
- Quick quiz: Students answer multiple-choice questions about the main concepts covered in the lesson.

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Research Project: Students investigate a traditional postpartum practice in Timor-Leste and write a short report on its potential effects on maternal and infant microbiome health.

2. Reflection: Write a personal reflection on how the knowledge gained in this lesson might influence their future work in public health in Timor-Leste.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Vaginal microbiome: The community of microorganisms that inhabit the vagina.
- Vertical transmission: The passage of microbes from mother to infant during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding.
- Colonization: The process by which microorganisms establish themselves in a new environment, such as an infant's gut.
- Gut-brain axis: The bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system.
- Colostrum: The first form of breast milk produced by mammary glands, rich in antibodies and beneficial microbes.
