# Lesson Plan: Microbiome and Non-Communicable Diseases

## 1. Resources Needed

- Projector and computer
- Whiteboard and markers
- Printed case studies of NCD patients
- Poster-making materials (large paper, markers, etc.)
- Handouts on microbiome-NCD connections

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain the relationship between the microbiome and common NCDs
- Analyze how microbiome changes may contribute to NCD development
- Propose potential microbiome-based interventions for NCD prevention and management
- Design an educational workshop on microbiome and NCD prevention for the community

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Students match common NCDs with potential microbiome-related factors
- Group discussion: Share personal experiences or knowledge of NCDs in Timor-Leste

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
- Obesity
- Type 2 diabetes
- Cardiovascular disease
- Gut-brain axis
- Dysbiosis

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of rising NCD prevalence in Timor-Leste
- Microbiome's role in obesity and diabetes:
  * Gut microbiota composition differences in obese vs. lean individuals
  * Microbial metabolites and insulin sensitivity
- Cardiovascular health and the microbiome:
  * TMAO production and atherosclerosis
  * Gut microbiota's influence on blood pressure
- Mental health and the gut-brain axis:
  * Microbial production of neurotransmitters
  * Inflammation and depression

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Small group work: Analyze case studies of NCD patients
  * Identify potential microbiome factors contributing to the condition
  * Suggest microbiome-based interventions
- Class discussion: Share findings and compare proposed interventions

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

- Divide class into groups to develop components of a community workshop on microbiome and NCD prevention:
  * Create an informational poster
  * Design an interactive activity
  * Develop key talking points for presentation

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Quick recap of main points covered
- Q&A session to address any remaining questions
- Preview of next lesson on microbiome-based interventions and therapies

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research a specific NCD prevalent in Timor-Leste and its potential microbiome connections
- Write a 1-page summary of findings and propose a culturally appropriate intervention

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Non-communicable diseases (NCDs): Chronic diseases that are not passed from person to person, often lifestyle-related
- Obesity: A medical condition characterized by excessive body fat accumulation
- Type 2 diabetes: A metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar and insulin resistance
- Cardiovascular disease: A group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels
- Gut-brain axis: The bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system
- Dysbiosis: An imbalance or maladaptation of the microbial community in the body
