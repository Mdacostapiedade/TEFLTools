# Lesson Plan: Microbiome-Based Interventions and Therapies

## 1. Resources Needed

- Copies of selected scientific papers on probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation
- Computer with internet access and projector
- Whiteboard and markers
- Poster paper and art supplies
- Samples of probiotic foods (e.g., yogurt, kefir, kombucha)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation
- Explain the potential benefits and risks of microbiome-based therapies
- Evaluate the feasibility of implementing microbiome interventions in Timor-Leste
- Design a culturally appropriate probiotic food for Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display images of various probiotic foods from around the world
- Ask students to identify any they recognize and share if they've tried them
- Discuss any traditional Timorese foods that might have probiotic properties

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and define key terms:
- Probiotics
- Prebiotics
- Fecal microbiota transplantation
- Microbiome-friendly medications
- Dysbiosis

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of probiotics and prebiotics
  * Definition, mechanisms of action, and potential health benefits
  * Examples of common probiotic strains and prebiotic fibers
- Introduction to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
  * History, procedure, and current applications
  * Potential risks and ethical considerations
- Microbiome-friendly medications
  * Concept and examples (e.g., narrow-spectrum antibiotics)
  * Importance in preserving beneficial microbes

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

- Small group activity: Analyze a scientific paper on a microbiome-based therapy
  * Each group reads a different paper and summarizes key findings
  * Groups present their findings to the class

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

- Debate: Ethical considerations of microbiome therapies
  * Divide class into pro and con teams for FMT or probiotic use
  * Teams prepare arguments and engage in structured debate
- Design activity: Create a culturally appropriate probiotic food for Timor-Leste
  * Students work in small groups to develop a concept
  * Consider local ingredients, flavors, and cultural preferences

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Class discussion on the feasibility of implementing microbiome interventions in Timor-Leste
- Review key points from the lesson
- Address any remaining questions or misconceptions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a 1-page proposal for a microbiome-based intervention to address a specific health issue in Timor-Leste
- Prepare a list of questions or concerns about microbiome therapies to discuss with a local healthcare professional

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Probiotics: Live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host
- Prebiotics: Non-digestible food ingredients that promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the intestines
- Fecal microbiota transplantation: The transfer of fecal matter from a healthy donor into the gastrointestinal tract of a recipient to treat recurrent C. difficile infections or other conditions
- Microbiome-friendly medications: Drugs designed to minimize disruption to the beneficial microbiota
- Dysbiosis: An imbalance or maladaptation of the microbiota, often associated with disease states
