## Excerpt from "The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying" by Sogyal Rinpoche

"Perhaps the deepest reason why we are afraid of death is because we do not know who we are. We believe in a personal, unique, and separate identity — but if we dare to examine it, we find that this identity depends entirely on an endless collection of things to prop it up: our name, our 'biography,' our partners, family, home, job, friends, credit cards... It is on their fragile and transient support that we rely for our security. So when they are all taken away, will we have any idea of who we really are?

Without our familiar props, we are faced with just ourselves, a person we do not know, an unnerving stranger with whom we have been living all the time but we never really wanted to meet. Isn't that why we have tried to fill every moment of time with noise and activity, however boring or trivial, to ensure that we are never left in silence with this stranger on our own?"

## Guided Meditation on Impermanence

1. Find a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.
2. Bring your attention to your breath. Notice how each inhale and exhale is unique, never exactly the same.
3. Expand your awareness to your body. Feel the subtle movements and changes with each breath.
4. Now, bring to mind a flower. Visualize it in full bloom, vibrant and beautiful.
5. Slowly watch as the flower begins to change. The petals may start to wilt, the colors may fade.
6. Continue observing as the flower completes its cycle, eventually returning to the earth.
7. Reflect on how this process of change is natural and ongoing in all things.
8. Bring your awareness back to your breath and body. Notice any changes in your physical or emotional state.
9. Slowly open your eyes, carrying the awareness of impermanence with you.

## Example: The Changing River

Imagine standing on the bank of a river. The water flows constantly, never the same from one moment to the next. You might step into the river, but you can never step into the same river twice. The water molecules that touch your feet are immediately replaced by new ones.

This river serves as a powerful metaphor for impermanence in our lives. Our thoughts, emotions, relationships, and circumstances are like the flowing water – always changing, never static. Just as we cannot hold onto the water in the river, we cannot truly grasp or permanently hold onto any aspect of our lives.

Understanding this can help us appreciate each moment more fully, knowing it will never come again in exactly the same way. It can also help us let go of what no longer serves us, recognizing that change is not only inevitable but also potentially beneficial for our growth and development.
