1. **Challenge**: Students may feel uncomfortable discussing death.
   **Solution**: Create a safe, respectful environment. Emphasize that sharing is voluntary and personal experiences are confidential.

   **Solution**: Use relatable examples from everyday life in Timor Leste. Encourage students to share their own interpretations.

3. **Challenge**: Conflict between Buddhist and traditional Timorese beliefs.
   **Solution**: Highlight similarities and emphasize that the course aims to explore different perspectives, not replace existing beliefs.

4. **Challenge**: Students struggling with meditation practice.
   **Solution**: Start with short, guided meditations. Offer alternatives like walking meditation or mindful breathing exercises.

5. **Challenge**: Language barriers with Buddhist terminology.
   **Solution**: Provide clear definitions and use local language equivalents where possible. Create a glossary of terms for reference.

6. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by the topic of death.
   **Solution**: Balance discussions of death with teachings on living fully. Incorporate lighthearted activities and breaks as needed.
