## Guided Meditation Script: 10-Minute Shamatha Practice

Find a comfortable seated position. Allow your spine to be straight but not rigid. Rest your hands in your lap or on your knees. Gently close your eyes.

Take a few deep breaths, allowing your body to relax with each exhale. Now, let your breath return to its natural rhythm. Bring your attention to the sensation of your breath at the nostrils or the rise and fall of your abdomen.

As you breathe naturally, simply observe the breath without trying to change it. If your mind wanders, gently acknowledge the thought and return your focus to the breath.

(Allow 8 minutes of silent meditation)

Slowly bring your awareness back to your body and surroundings. When you're ready, gently open your eyes.

2. Walking meditation on the beach: Pay attention to the sensation of sand under your feet and the sound of waves.
3. Mindful cooking: Be fully present while preparing traditional Timorese dishes, noticing textures, smells, and movements.
4. Breath awareness during church services: Use quiet moments to focus on your breath, cultivating inner peace.
5. Sunset meditation: End the day with a short meditation while watching the sun set over the mountains or sea.
