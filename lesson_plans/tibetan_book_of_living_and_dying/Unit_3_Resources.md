# Additional Materials

## Guided Tonglen Meditation Script

Begin by sitting comfortably, with your back straight but relaxed. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, allowing your body to settle.

Now, bring to mind someone you know who is suffering. It could be a friend, family member, or even a stranger you've heard about. Hold them in your awareness with a sense of compassion.

As you breathe in, imagine that you are breathing in their suffering, visualized as dark, heavy smoke. Take it in fully, without resistance.

As you breathe out, imagine sending them relief, healing, and whatever they need most. Visualize this as bright, cooling light flowing out to them.

Continue this rhythm of breathing in suffering and breathing out relief. With each breath, feel your heart opening wider, your compassion growing stronger.

Now, expand your awareness to include others who are suffering in similar ways. Breathe in their collective pain, and breathe out collective healing and relief.

Gradually extend this practice to all beings everywhere who are experiencing any kind of suffering. Breathe in the pain of the world, and breathe out peace, love, and healing for all.

Finally, rest in the open awareness of your heart, feeling the connection to all beings.

When you're ready, slowly open your eyes and return to the room.

## Bodhichitta Aspiration Prayer

May I develop bodhichitta, the awakened heart,
For the benefit of all sentient beings.
May my every thought, word, and action
Be motivated by compassion and wisdom.

May I see the suffering of others as my own,
And have the courage to take it on.
May I transform all negativity into love,
And radiate kindness to all I encounter.

Through this practice, may all beings be free from suffering,
May they find lasting happiness and peace.
May the light of bodhichitta illuminate the world,
Guiding all to perfect enlightenment.
