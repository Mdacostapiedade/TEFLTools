## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may find it difficult to relate to Buddhist concepts.
   **Solution**: Use local examples and draw parallels with Timorese cultural values. Encourage students to share their own experiences of compassion.

2. **Challenge**: Some students may feel overwhelmed by the idea of taking on others' suffering in tonglen practice.
   **Solution**: Emphasize that the practice is gradual and can start with small, manageable situations. Encourage students to begin with themselves or loved ones before expanding to others.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with the concept of absolute bodhichitta.
   **Solution**: Focus more on relative bodhichitta and practical applications of compassion. Introduce absolute bodhichitta as an advanced concept for those interested in deeper study.

4. **Challenge**: Cultural differences may arise when discussing Buddhist practices.
   **Solution**: Always maintain respect for local beliefs and traditions. Present Buddhist concepts as complementary rather than contradictory to existing values.

5. **Challenge**: Students may find daily meditation practice difficult to maintain.
   **Solution**: Suggest starting with short, achievable goals (e.g., 5 minutes daily). Provide tips for incorporating practice into daily routines and encourage peer support groups.
