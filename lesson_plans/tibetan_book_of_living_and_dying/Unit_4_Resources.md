## The Clear Light of Death
From "The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying" by Sogyal Rinpoche:

"At the moment of death, there occurs what is called the 'inner dissolution,' when the senses and subtle elements dissolve. The first thing we may be aware of is when the earth element dissolves into the water element. We feel as if we are falling, sinking underground, or being crushed by a great weight. Some traditional texts say it is as if a huge mountain were being pressed down upon us. We feel heavy and oppressed; we may even have the sensation that we are drowning. Together with this we may have some feeling of panic and acute fear. These are signs that the earth element is withdrawing into the water element, and that the energy of the earth element is becoming less available to our consciousness.

Next the water element dissolves into fire. We begin to lose control of our bodily fluids. Our mouth becomes dry, our nose starts to run, and we may become incontinent. We may feel that we are drowning, or being swept away by a huge river. As the water element dissolves, we are left with a feeling of being consumed by fire. The fire element is dissolving into air. The warmth of our body begins to seep away, usually from the feet and hands toward the heart. Perhaps we may even steam. Our breath becomes more and more shallow.

At this point we may have the vision of a flame about to go out. We may experience swinging between agitation and torpor. The air or wind element is dissolving into consciousness. We begin to have difficulty breathing. The air seems to be escaping through our throat. We feel as if we are going to faint or black out. We may feel as if we are spinning or being blown away, as if in a hurricane.

After this, our breathing ceases. A slight warmth still remains at our heart. And at the very end, as the subtle consciousness dissolves, we have a sensation of everything dissolving into the all-encompassing space.

Then, finally, our central channel opens and the luminosity of the Ground of Being manifests. Suddenly we become aware of a state of consciousness we have never experienced before, which is called the 'Clear Light of Death.' This is the fundamental, inherent nature of mind, stripped of all its usual obscurations and fleeting thoughts—a state of pure awareness, infinite and all-encompassing. For a moment, we experience the true nature of mind."

## Guided Visualization Script: The Dying Process

[Soft background music begins]

Find a comfortable position and gently close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths, allowing your body to relax with each exhale.

Imagine yourself in a peaceful setting – perhaps a serene meadow or a quiet room. You feel completely at ease, knowing that you are safe and supported.

Now, begin to notice subtle changes in your body. There's a sense of heaviness, as if gravity is becoming stronger. Your limbs feel weighty, and movement becomes difficult. This is the earth element dissolving.

Next, you become aware of a dryness in your mouth and eyes. Your skin feels less supple. There's a sensation of heat growing within you, as if your inner fire is consuming the water in your body. The water element is dissolving into fire.

The heat begins to fade now, starting from your extremities. Your fingers and toes feel cool, then your arms and legs. The warmth retreats towards your core. Your breath becomes shallower. The fire element is dissolving into air.

Your breath slows further, becoming barely perceptible. There's a sensation of spinning or floating, as if you're becoming lighter than air. The air element is dissolving into consciousness.

Now, imagine a single point of warm, bright light in the center of your chest. As your breath stills completely, this light begins to expand. It grows, filling your entire body with radiant, clear awareness.

The light continues to expand beyond your body, dissolving any sense of boundaries. You experience a vast, luminous space of pure consciousness. There is no fear, no attachment, only open awareness.

Rest in this space of clear light, free from concepts or limitations. 

[Pause for 30 seconds]

Slowly, gently, begin to bring your awareness back to your body. Feel your breath returning, your senses reawakening. When you're ready, open your eyes, carrying with you the peace and insight from this experience.

[Music fades]
