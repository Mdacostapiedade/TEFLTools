# Excerpts and Short Stories

## The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying - Bardo of Dharmata

"The bardo of dharmata dawns immediately after the black experience of the end of the bardo of dying. This is the state of primordial purity, which is like a clear and empty sky. The ground luminosity, the fundamental nature of everything, manifests in all its splendor. This luminosity is the natural radiance of your own mind, and it appears as various colors and sounds.

At first, this experience can be overwhelming and even frightening. But if you can recognize this luminosity as the natural display of your own mind, you will be liberated. This recognition is called the 'meeting of mother and child luminosities.' The mother luminosity is the ground luminosity that has always been present, and the child luminosity is your present awareness recognizing it.

If you fail to recognize this luminosity, the bardo of dharmata will fade, and you will enter the bardo of becoming."

## The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying - Bardo of Becoming

"In the bardo of becoming, you have a mental body that can go anywhere instantly, simply by thinking of a place. This mental body is very vulnerable to your thoughts and emotions, which can manifest as real experiences in this bardo.

You may experience visions of future lives, and be drawn towards certain realms of existence based on your karma. It's crucial during this time to maintain awareness and not be swept away by these visions.

The bardo of becoming can last up to 49 days, after which you will take rebirth. Throughout this bardo, there are still opportunities for liberation if you can recognize the true nature of your experiences."

## Guided Visualization Script: Bardo of Dharmata

(To be read slowly, with pauses)

Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Imagine that you have just experienced the moment of death. The darkness fades, and you find yourself in a vast, limitless space.

Suddenly, a brilliant light appears. It's brighter than anything you've ever seen, yet it doesn't hurt your eyes. This is the ground luminosity, the fundamental nature of your mind.

As you observe, the light begins to take on colors - vibrant blues, reds, greens, and yellows. These colors swirl and dance around you.

Now, you begin to hear sounds. They start as faint whispers but grow into a symphony of tones and vibrations. These sounds and colors are the natural display of your mind's true nature.

At first, you might feel overwhelmed or even frightened by the intensity of these experiences. But remember, this is the nature of your own mind. Can you recognize it?

Take a moment to simply be present with these experiences, neither grasping at them nor pushing them away.

As you rest in this awareness, feel a sense of profound peace and clarity. This is your opportunity for liberation.

Slowly, bring your attention back to your body and the room around you. When you're ready, open your eyes.

## Sample Prayers for the Deceased (in English and Tetum)

1. English:
   "May you be free from confusion and fear.
   May you recognize the true nature of your mind.
   May you find peace and ultimate liberation."

   Tetum:
   "Bele ita livre husi konfuzaun no tauk.
   Bele ita rekoñese natureza loos ita-nia hanoin nian.
   Bele ita hetan dame no libertasaun ikus."

2. English:
   "Through the power of compassion and wisdom,
   May you navigate the bardos with awareness.
   May all beings benefit from your journey."

   Tetum:
   "Liu husi kbiit laran luak no matenek,
   Bele ita lao liu bardos ho konxiénsia.
   Bele ema hotu hetan benefísiu husi ita-nia viajen."
