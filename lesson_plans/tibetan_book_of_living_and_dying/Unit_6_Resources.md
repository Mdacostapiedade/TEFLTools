# Excerpts and Short Stories

## "Death as an Advisor" from The Teachings of Don Juan by Carlos Castaneda

"In a world where death is the hunter, my friend, there is no time for regrets or doubts. There is only time for decisions."

"Death is our eternal companion. It is always to our left, at an arm's length. It was watching you when you were watching the wind; it was settling on your nose as you breathed the breeze; it was in the glint of light in your eyes."

"How can anyone feel so important when we know that death is stalking us? The thing to do when you're impatient is to turn to your left and ask advice from your death. An immense amount of pettiness is dropped if your death makes a gesture to you, or if you catch a glimpse of it, or if you just have the feeling that your companion is there watching you."
