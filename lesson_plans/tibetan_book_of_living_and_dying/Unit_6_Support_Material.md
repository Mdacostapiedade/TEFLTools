## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to create a realistic daily practice schedule.
   **Solution**: Encourage starting small with 5-10 minutes of practice daily. Emphasize consistency over duration.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in reconciling Buddhist concepts with local Timorese beliefs.
   **Solution**: Highlight similarities between Buddhist and Timorese spiritual concepts. Encourage students to see Buddhist teachings as complementary rather than contradictory to their existing beliefs.

3. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by contemplating death.
   **Solution**: Balance discussions of death with teachings on appreciating life. Provide emotional support and encourage students to share their feelings openly.

4. **Challenge**: Resistance to sharing personal mission statements in small groups.
   **Solution**: Make sharing optional and start by sharing your own mission statement as an example. Emphasize the supportive, non-judgmental nature of the exercise.

5. **Challenge**: Students struggling to maintain their practice outside of class.
   **Solution**: Create a buddy system or study groups for mutual support. Offer optional check-ins between classes to address challenges and celebrate successes.
