## Definition and Basic Concepts of Time Banking

Time banking is an alternative economic system where time is the primary currency. In a time bank, people exchange services for time credits instead of money. One hour of service equals one time credit, regardless of the type of service provided.

Key concepts:
- Time as currency
- Equal value of all hours
- Reciprocal exchange of services
- Community-building through service

Time banking operates on five core principles:
1. Assets: Everyone has something to contribute
2. Redefining work: All work is valued equally
3. Reciprocity: Helping works better as a two-way street
4. Social networks: People helping each other build stronger communities
5. Respect: Every human being matters

## History of Time Banking and Its Founders

- 1980s: Edgar Cahn develops the concept of time banking while recovering from a heart attack
- 1986: First time bank established in Washington, D.C.
- 1987: Time Dollar Network founded by Cahn
- 1995: Time banking spreads to the UK
- 2000s: Time banking expands globally, with initiatives in over 30 countries

Key figures:
- Edgar Cahn: Founder of time banking, civil rights lawyer, and social innovator
- Ana Miyares: Co-founder of TimeBanks USA
- Martin Simon: Founder of Timebanking UK

## Core Values of Time Banking

   - Challenges traditional economic hierarchies
   - Promotes inclusivity and diversity

2. Reciprocity
   - Giving and receiving are equally important

   - Builds trust and social capital
   - Encourages local problem-solving and resilience

2. Research the chosen time bank using online resources, academic articles, or by contacting the organization directly.
3. Write a one-page summary (300-400 words) addressing the following questions:
   - How does this time bank operate? (Structure, membership, technology used)
   - What types of services are commonly exchanged?
   - What benefits does the time bank provide to its community?
   - What challenges has the time bank faced, and how were they addressed?

## Example Time Bank Exchange Scenarios

1. Maria teaches João how to cook a traditional Timorese dish for 2 hours. She earns 2 time credits.
2. João uses his 2 time credits to get help from Ana with English language practice.
3. Ana spends 3 hours helping elderly neighbor Tomas with garden work, earning 3 time credits.
4. Tomas uses 1 time credit to attend a community class on traditional weaving techniques.
5. The weaving instructor, Lucia, uses her earned time credits for childcare while she attends a job interview.

Discuss how these exchanges build community connections and support individual needs without monetary transactions.
