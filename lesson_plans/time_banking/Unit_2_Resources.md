# Lecture Notes

## The Concept of Co-production in Time Banking

### Definition and Importance
- Co-production: A collaborative approach where service providers and users work together to create and deliver services
- In time banking, members are both producers and consumers of services
- Emphasizes equal participation and shared responsibility

### Differences from Traditional Service Delivery
- Traditional: Top-down, professional-driven approach
- Co-production: Bottom-up, collaborative approach
- Recognizes and values the skills and contributions of all participants
- Builds on existing community assets and strengths

## Time as a Currency

### Valuing All Time Equally
- One hour of service = One time credit, regardless of the type of service
- Challenges traditional notions of skill valuation
- Promotes equality and inclusivity

### Implications for Skill Valuation and Equality
- Recognizes and values diverse skills and contributions
- Empowers individuals who may be marginalized in the traditional economy
- Potential challenges in balancing equality with the need for specialized skills

## Critiques of the Market Economy

### Inequality and Social Exclusion
- Concentration of wealth and resources
- Undervaluation of unpaid work (e.g., caregiving, community service)
- Limited access to goods and services for marginalized groups

### Undervaluation of Certain Types of Work
- Focus on monetary value overlooks social and community contributions
- Neglect of informal economy and non-monetized exchanges
- Devaluation of traditional knowledge and skills

## How Time Banking Addresses Market Economy Critiques

### Recognizing and Valuing All Contributions
- Equal valuation of time challenges traditional hierarchies
- Inclusion of services often overlooked in the market economy
- Validation of diverse skills and knowledge

### Building Social Capital and Community Resilience
- Strengthens community networks and relationships
- Promotes mutual support and reciprocity
- Enhances community self-reliance and problem-solving capacity

## Case Study: Fureai Kippu System in Japan

The Fureai Kippu ("Caring Relationship Tickets") system in Japan is a time banking initiative focused on providing care for the elderly. Established in 1995, it allows people to earn time credits by helping seniors with tasks such as shopping, cleaning, or companionship. These credits can be saved for future use when the volunteers themselves need care, or they can be transferred to family members living in different parts of the country.

Key Points:
- Addresses the challenges of an aging population
- Promotes intergenerational relationships
- Combines traditional values of filial piety with modern time banking concepts
- Has spread to over 300 organizations across Japan

Discussion: How might a similar system be adapted to address social challenges in Timor-Leste, such as care for veterans or preservation of traditional knowledge?

## Excerpt: "No More Throw-Away People" by Edgar S. Cahn

"Time Dollars are based on a simple principle: One hour of helping another earns one Time Dollar. Time Dollars can be exchanged for an hour of help from someone else. The system is based on equality: Everyone's time is valued equally. The system is based on reciprocity: Giving and receiving are of equal importance. The system is based on community: We are all assets, and we all have something to contribute."

Reflection Questions:
1. How does this principle challenge traditional economic thinking?
2. In what ways might this approach to valuing time impact social relationships in Timorese communities?
3. What potential benefits and challenges could arise from implementing this principle in Timor-Leste?
