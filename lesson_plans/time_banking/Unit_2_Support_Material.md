## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to understand how time banking differs from volunteering or bartering.
   **Solution**: Use concrete examples relevant to Timorese culture and emphasize the systematic, reciprocal nature of time banking.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in relating time banking concepts to Timorese cultural values.
   **Solution**: Before the lesson, research and prepare examples of traditional Timorese practices that embody reciprocity and community cooperation.

3. **Challenge**: Students may be skeptical about the practicality of time banking in Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Provide case studies of successful time banking initiatives in other developing countries or post-conflict societies.

4. **Challenge**: Ensuring balanced participation in the debate activity.
   **Solution**: Assign roles within each team (e.g., researcher, speaker) to encourage participation from all students.

5. **Challenge**: Students may have difficulty with the concept of valuing all time equally.
   **Solution**: Facilitate a discussion on the social and philosophical implications of this principle, relating it to concepts of equality and human dignity.
