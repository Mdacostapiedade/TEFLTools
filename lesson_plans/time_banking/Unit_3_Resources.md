## Types of Time Bank Exchanges

### Person-to-Person Exchanges
- Definition: Direct exchanges of services between individual time bank members
- Examples:
  * Member A gives a guitar lesson to Member B
  * Member C helps Member D with gardening
- Key features:
  * Both parties earn/spend time credits
  * Builds direct community connections
  * Allows for diverse skill sharing

### Person-to-Agency Exchanges
- Definition: Exchanges between individual members and participating organizations
- Examples:
  * Member volunteers at a local nonprofit and earns time credits
  * Agency provides a service (e.g., meeting space) to a member in exchange for time credits
- Key features:
  * Integrates organizational resources into the time bank
  * Can provide structured volunteering opportunities
  * Allows agencies to "pay" for services with time credits

### Agency-to-Agency Exchanges
- Definition: Exchanges of services between participating organizations
- Examples:
  * Nonprofit A provides marketing services to Nonprofit B
  * Government agency shares equipment with a community center
- Key features:
  * Facilitates resource sharing between organizations
  * Can lead to stronger inter-agency collaborations
  * Allows organizations to access services they might not afford in cash economy

## Operational Aspects of Time Banks

### Role of Time Bank Coordinators
- Primary responsibilities:
  * Member recruitment and orientation

  * Maintaining the time bank software/database
  * Resolving conflicts or issues
  * Promoting the time bank in the community
- Importance:
  * Central to the smooth operation of the time bank
  * Often the face of the time bank to the community
  * Crucial for maintaining trust and engagement

### Time Credits System
- Basic concept:
  * One hour of service = One time credit
  * All services valued equally
- Earning credits:
  * Members provide services to others
  * Credits are added to their account
- Spending credits:
  * Members request services from others
  * Credits are deducted from their account
- Key principles:
  * Equality of time
  * Reciprocity encouraged but not strictly enforced

### Time Bank Software and Record-Keeping
- Purpose:
  * Track member accounts and balances
  * Record exchanges
  * Generate reports and statistics
- Common features:
  * Member profiles and skills listings
  * Exchange logging system
  * Messaging or request board
  * Administrative tools for coordinators
- Examples of software:
  * Community Weaver
  * hOurworld
  * TimeRepublik

## Roles within a Time Bank

  * Offer skills and services
  * Request help when needed
  * Log their exchanges
  * Participate in time bank events or meetings
- Benefits:

  * Opportunity to contribute to community
  * Development of new skills and relationships

### Partner Organizations
- Types:
  * Nonprofits
  * Government agencies
  * Community groups
  * Local businesses
- Roles:
  * Offer organizational resources or services
  * Provide volunteering opportunities for members
  * Help promote the time bank
  * May serve on advisory board

### Advisory Board or Steering Committee
- Composition:
  * Time bank members
  * Community leaders
  * Representatives from partner organizations
- Functions:
  * Guide overall strategy and policies
  * Support fundraising efforts
  * Help with community outreach and partnerships

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Essay: Designing a Time Bank for Your Community

1. Choose a specific community in Timor-Leste (it can be your hometown, a village you're familiar with, or a neighborhood in Dili).

2. Write a 500-word reflective essay outlining how you would design a time bank system for this community. Consider the following points:

   a. What types of exchanges (person-to-person, person-to-agency, agency-to-agency) would be most relevant and why?
   
   b. How would you structure the operational aspects of the time bank, considering local resources and constraints?
   
   c. What roles would be essential in your time bank, and how would you recruit for these positions?
   
   d. How would you address potential cultural or logistical challenges specific to your chosen community?
   
   e. What potential positive impacts could the time bank have on this community?

3. Conclude your essay by reflecting on what you learned about the complexity of implementing a time bank system through this exercise.

# Assignment Details

## Time Bank Exchange Simulation

### Objective
To gain practical understanding of how different types of time bank exchanges work and the roles involved in managing a time bank system.

### Instructions
1. Form groups of 4-5 students.

2. Each group will create a mock time bank for a fictional Timorese community. Assign the following roles within your group:
   - Time Bank Coordinator
   - 2-3 Individual Members
   - 1 Representative from a Partner Organization

3. Develop a list of at least 10 services that could be exchanged within your time bank, ensuring a mix of skills relevant to your fictional community.

4. Create a simple record-keeping system (this can be a spreadsheet or even a paper-based system) to track exchanges and time credit balances.

5. Simulate at least 5 exchanges, including:
   - 2 person-to-person exchanges
   - 2 person-to-agency exchanges
   - 1 agency-to-agency exchange

6. For each exchange, role-play the interaction, including how the service is requested, performed, and recorded in your system.

7. After completing the exchanges, have the Time Bank Coordinator generate a simple report showing:
   - Total number of hours exchanged
   - Most popular services
   - Any challenges encountered and how they were resolved

8. Prepare a 10-minute presentation for the class, explaining your time bank system, demonstrating a sample exchange, and sharing insights from your simulation experience.

### Deliverables
- Written description of your fictional community and time bank structure
- List of services offered in your time bank
- Record-keeping system with simulated exchanges
- Coordinator's report
- Group presentation

### Evaluation Criteria
- Creativity and relevance of the time bank design to the Timorese context
- Accuracy in simulating different types of exchanges
- Effectiveness of the record-keeping system
- Quality of insights and reflections in the presentation
- Demonstration of understanding of key time banking concepts

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Banco Palmas, Brazil

While not strictly a time bank, Banco Palmas in Brazil offers an interesting example of a community currency system that could provide insights for implementing time banking in Timor-Leste.

### Background
- Founded in 1998 in Conjunto Palmeira, a poor neighborhood in Fortaleza, Brazil
- Created to address extreme poverty and lack of economic opportunities

### Key Features
- Local currency (Palmas) circulating alongside national currency
- Microcredit loans in local currency
- Professional training programs
- Local production and consumption incentives

### Relevance to Time Banking in Timor-Leste
- Demonstrates the potential of alternative currencies in developing economies
- Shows how community-led initiatives can address economic challenges
- Highlights the importance of adapting systems to local needs and culture

## Timorese Cultural Considerations Checklist

When designing a time bank system for Timor-Leste, consider the following cultural factors:

- [ ] Language: Ensure the system can operate in Tetum and other local languages
- [ ] Oral traditions: Incorporate methods for non-written exchange recording if needed
- [ ] Community hierarchies: Consider how traditional leadership structures might interact with time bank roles
- [ ] Collective vs. individual mindset: Adapt the system to emphasize community benefits
- [ ] Religious influences: Be aware of how religious practices might affect service exchanges or time availability
- [ ] Rural vs. urban dynamics: Design flexibility for different community settings
- [ ] Traditional exchange systems: Look for ways to integrate or complement existing reciprocal practices
- [ ] Technology access: Plan for both high-tech and low-tech operational methods
- [ ] Gender roles: Ensure the system promotes equal participation across genders
- [ ] Intergenerational relationships: Encourage exchanges that promote knowledge sharing between generations
