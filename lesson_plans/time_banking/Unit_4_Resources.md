## Social Capital and Community Building

### Definition of Social Capital
- Social capital refers to the networks of relationships among people in a society that enable it to function effectively
- Key components: trust, reciprocity, shared norms, and social networks
- Robert Putnam's work on social capital and civic engagement

### How Time Banking Builds Trust and Reciprocity
- Equal valuation of time encourages participation from all community members
- Repeated exchanges build trust between participants
- Reciprocal nature of time banking reinforces community bonds
- Time banking as a tool for rebuilding social networks in fragmented communities

### Examples of Increased Community Engagement
- Rushey Green Time Bank (UK): Health center-based time bank improving patient well-being
- Dane County TimeBank (USA): Youth Court program reducing recidivism rates
- Blaengarw Time Centre (Wales): Revitalizing a post-industrial community through time banking

## Economic Resilience and Local Development

### Time Banking as a Complementary Currency System
- Definition of complementary currencies
- Time credits as a medium of exchange alongside national currency
- Potential to stimulate local economic activity during economic downturns

### Impact on Local Economies During Economic Downturns
- Providing access to services when money is scarce
- Supporting informal economy and skill-sharing
- Reducing reliance on external economic factors

### Case Studies of Time Banks Supporting Local Businesses
- Ithaca HOURS (USA): Local currency system supporting small businesses
- Spice Time Credits (UK): Partnering with local organizations to offer rewards

## Inclusion of Marginalized Groups

### Examples of Time Banks Engaging Marginalized Groups
- Elderly: Reducing social isolation and providing opportunities to contribute
- Youth: Skill development and community integration
- Unemployed: Maintaining skills and building networks during job searches
- Immigrants: Language exchange and cultural integration

### Potential Applications for Marginalized Groups in Timor-Leste
- Youth unemployment: Skill-sharing and mentorship opportunities
