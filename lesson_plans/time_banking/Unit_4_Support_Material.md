## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to understand how time banking differs from volunteering.
   **Solution**: Use concrete examples and role-playing exercises to illustrate the reciprocal nature of time banking.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in relating time banking to the Timorese context.
   **Solution**: Encourage students to draw parallels with traditional Timorese practices of community cooperation and reciprocity.

3. **Challenge**: Skepticism about the economic viability of time banking.
   **Solution**: Present case studies of successful time banks in developing countries and discuss how they complement rather than replace traditional economies.

4. **Challenge**: Students may find it hard to envision practical applications.
   **Solution**: Organize a field trip to a local community organization or invite a guest speaker to discuss potential implementations.

5. **Challenge**: Overcoming the perception that all services should have equal value.
   **Solution**: Facilitate a discussion on the philosophy behind time banking and its focus on valuing people's time equally, regardless of the type of service provided.
