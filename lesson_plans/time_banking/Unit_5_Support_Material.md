## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may struggle to understand how time banking differs from traditional volunteering.
   Solution: Use concrete examples and role-playing exercises to illustrate the reciprocal nature of time banking.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in adapting international case studies to the Timor-Leste context.
   Solution: Encourage students to identify similarities and differences between the case study locations and Timor-Leste, focusing on adaptable elements.

3. Challenge: Students may be skeptical about the feasibility of time banking in their communities.
   Solution: Highlight successful time banking initiatives in developing countries and emphasize the flexibility of the model.

4. Challenge: Limited access to technology for time banking software demonstrations.
   Solution: Prepare offline materials that simulate time banking processes, such as paper ledgers or card systems.

5. Challenge: Students may have difficulty envisioning practical applications in Timor-Leste.
   Solution: Invite local community leaders or NGO representatives to share insights on potential applications and challenges.
