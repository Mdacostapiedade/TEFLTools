## Definition and Principles of UBI

### What is Universal Basic Income?
- A regular cash payment
- Given to all members of a community
- On an individual basis
- Without means test or work requirement

### Key Characteristics of UBI
1. Universal: Everyone receives it, regardless of income or status
2. Unconditional: No requirements for receiving the payment
3. Regular: Paid at consistent intervals (e.g., monthly)
4. Cash-based: Monetary payment, not in-kind benefits
5. Individual: Paid to each person, not households

### Core Principles
- Poverty reduction
- Economic security
- Social justice
- Freedom of choice

## Historical Background and Evolution of UBI Ideas

### Early Concepts
- Thomas Paine (1737-1809): Proposed a citizen's dividend in "Agrarian Justice"
- Charles Fourier (1772-1837): Advocated for a minimum income guarantee

### 20th Century Developments
- Milton Friedman (1962): Negative Income Tax proposal
- Martin Luther King Jr. (1967): Supported guaranteed income to abolish poverty
- 1960s-70s: Negative Income Tax experiments in the United States

### Recent History
- 1980s-90s: Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend implementation
- 2000s-2010s: Growing academic interest and pilot programs

## Current Global Interest in UBI

### Factors Driving Interest
1. Automation and job displacement concerns
2. Rising income inequality
3. Limitations of current welfare systems
4. Simplification of social support mechanisms

### Notable Recent UBI Experiments
1. Finland (2017-2018)
2. Ontario, Canada (2017-2019, cancelled early)
3. Kenya (ongoing, run by GiveDirectly)
4. Stockton, California (2019-2021)

### Potential Benefits
- Poverty reduction
- Improved health outcomes
- Increased educational attainment
- Economic stability
- Entrepreneurship boost

### Potential Challenges
- Cost and funding
- Inflation concerns
- Work disincentives
- Political feasibility

# Discussion Questions

1. How might the implementation of UBI differ in Timor-Leste compared to more developed countries?

2. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of UBI compared to targeted social welfare programs in Timor-Leste?

3. How could Timor-Leste's oil and gas revenues potentially be used to fund a UBI program?

4. In what ways might UBI impact traditional social structures and family dynamics in Timor-Leste?

5. How could a UBI program affect rural vs. urban populations in Timor-Leste differently?

6. What are the potential gender implications of implementing UBI in Timor-Leste?

7. How might UBI impact informal employment sectors in Timor-Leste?

8. What infrastructure challenges might Timor-Leste face in implementing a UBI program, and how could these be addressed?

9. How could a UBI program in Timor-Leste be designed to complement rather than replace existing social programs?

10. What lessons can Timor-Leste learn from cash transfer programs implemented in other developing countries?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflection on UBI in Timor-Leste

Write a 500-word reflection essay addressing the following prompt:

"Imagine Timor-Leste has decided to implement a Universal Basic Income program. Describe how this program might impact one specific aspect of Timorese society (e.g., education, healthcare, entrepreneurship, rural development). Consider both potential positive and negative consequences, and support your arguments with logical reasoning and, where possible, examples from other countries or relevant research."

Guidelines:
- Clearly state the aspect of society you are focusing on in your introduction
- Provide a brief explanation of how UBI would work in Timor-Leste
- Discuss at least two potential positive impacts and two potential negative impacts
- Consider short-term and long-term effects
- Conclude with your overall assessment of whether UBI would be beneficial for this aspect of Timorese society

# Assignment Details

## Research and Presentation on Global UBI Pilot Program

1. Form groups of 2-3 students
2. Each group will be assigned a different UBI pilot program from around the world
3. Research your assigned program using academic sources, news articles, and official reports
4. Prepare a 10-minute presentation covering the following points:
   - Location and duration of the pilot program
   - Key features (e.g., payment amount, frequency, eligibility)
   - Goals and objectives of the program
   - Methodology used (e.g., randomized control trial, sample size)
   - Preliminary or final results (if available)
   - Challenges faced during implementation
   - Criticisms or controversies surrounding the program
   - Lessons that could be applied to a potential UBI program in Timor-Leste
5. Create a visual aid (e.g., PowerPoint, poster) to accompany your presentation
6. Be prepared to answer questions from the class and instructor

Grading Criteria:
- Thoroughness of research (25%)
- Clarity of presentation (25%)
- Analysis of program's relevance to Timor-Leste (20%)
- Quality of visual aid (15%)
- Ability to answer questions (15%)

## Key Definitions Handout

Universal Basic Income (UBI): A regular cash payment given to all members of a community on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement.

Universal: Covering or including all members of a given population.

Unconditional: Given or granted without conditions or requirements.

Basic needs: The essential resources required for long-term physical well-being, such as food, water, and shelter.

Cash transfer: A direct transfer of money to individuals or households.

Social safety net: A collection of services provided by the state to support vulnerable or disadvantaged members of society.

Poverty alleviation: Efforts to improve the quality of life for those living in poverty.

## Example UBI Calculation for Timor-Leste

Population of Timor-Leste (2021 estimate): 1.3 million
Proposed monthly UBI amount: $100 USD

Annual cost calculation:
1.3 million people × $100 per month × 12 months = $1.56 billion USD per year

Timor-Leste GDP (2020): $1.92 billion USD

Cost of UBI as percentage of GDP: (1.56 / 1.92) × 100 = 81.25%

Note: This is a simplified calculation for illustrative purposes. Actual implementation would require more complex economic modeling and consideration of funding sources, such as oil and gas revenues.
