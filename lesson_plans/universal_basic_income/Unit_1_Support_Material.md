## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students may have preconceived notions about UBI.
   Tip: Begin with the warm-up activity to surface existing ideas, then address misconceptions throughout the lesson.

2. Challenge: The concept of UBI may seem abstract or irrelevant to students.
   Tip: Use local examples and encourage students to relate UBI to their own experiences or community needs.

3. Challenge: Students may struggle to understand the economic implications of UBI.
   Tip: Use simple analogies and real-world examples to explain economic concepts. Consider inviting a local economist as a guest speaker.

4. Challenge: Limited internet access for research activities.
   Tip: Prepare printed materials on various UBI pilot programs as a backup. Alternatively, assign research as homework if students have better internet access outside of class.

5. Challenge: Students may have difficulty imagining UBI implementation in Timor-Leste.
   Tip: Provide context on Timor-Leste's current social welfare system and economic situation. Encourage creative thinking about how UBI could be adapted to local conditions.

6. Challenge: Balancing different perspectives on UBI.
   Tip: Ensure that both supportive and critical viewpoints are presented. Encourage respectful debate and critical thinking about the pros and cons of UBI.
