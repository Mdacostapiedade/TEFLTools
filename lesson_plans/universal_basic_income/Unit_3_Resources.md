- Different categories based on years of service and level of contribution
- Monthly payments range from $276 to $575
- Covers approximately 30,000 beneficiaries

## Analysis of Program Effectiveness and Coverage

### Beneficiary Numbers and Demographics
- Total social protection coverage: approximately 180,000 individuals
- Demographic breakdown:
  * Bolsa da Mãe: Primarily women (80%) and children
  * Old Age Pension: Slightly more women (52%) than men
  * Veterans' Pension: Predominantly men (95%)

### Impact on Poverty Reduction
- Overall poverty rate decreased from 50.4% (2007) to 41.8% (2014)
- Bolsa da Mãe: 
  * 9% reduction in extreme poverty among beneficiaries
  * 13% increase in school enrollment for beneficiary children
- Old Age Pension:
  * 10% reduction in poverty among elderly households
  * Improved food security and access to healthcare

### Geographic Distribution of Benefits
- Urban areas have higher coverage rates (65%) compared to rural areas (55%)
- Remote mountainous regions face challenges in program implementation
- Highest coverage in Dili (capital) and lowest in Oecusse (exclave region)

## Challenges in Program Implementation and Targeting

### Administrative Capacity
- Limited number of trained social workers and program administrators
- Weak coordination between different government agencies
- Inadequate monitoring and evaluation systems

### Infrastructure Limitations
- Poor road conditions in rural areas hinder benefit delivery
- Limited banking infrastructure for cash transfers
- Unreliable electricity and internet connectivity for data management

### Targeting Accuracy
- Bolsa da Mãe: Exclusion errors (eligible families not receiving benefits) estimated at 30%
- Inclusion errors (non-eligible families receiving benefits) estimated at 15%
- Challenges in verifying household income and composition

### Financial Constraints
- Social protection spending accounts for 15% of government budget
- Heavy reliance on oil and gas revenues for funding
- Sustainability concerns as petroleum fund depletes

3. How might the geographic disparities in program coverage impact overall national development in Timor-Leste?

4. What strategies could be implemented to improve the targeting accuracy of programs like Bolsa da Mãe?

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Bolsa da Mãe Program Implementation in Ermera District

Ermera is a mountainous district in Timor-Leste known for its coffee production. It has a population of approximately 125,000 and a poverty rate higher than the national average. This case study examines the implementation of the Bolsa da Mãe program in Ermera, highlighting successes and challenges.

### Key Points:
- Program reached 7,500 households in Ermera as of 2020
- School enrollment increased by 15% among beneficiary children
- Challenges:
  * Limited number of social workers (1 per 1,500 households)
  * Difficult terrain makes regular monitoring visits challenging
  * High illiteracy rates among beneficiaries complicate program understanding
- Local innovation: Partnership with coffee cooperatives to assist with benefit distribution

### Discussion:
1. How could the Bolsa da Mãe program be adapted to better suit the specific context of Ermera?
2. What lessons from this case study might be applicable to other districts in Timor-Leste?
