# Lesson Plan: UBI vs. Existing Transfer Programs in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector and computer
- Handouts comparing UBI and existing transfer programs
- Flip charts and markers for group work
- Access to internet for research

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Compare the features of UBI with current social welfare programs in Timor-Leste
- Analyze potential advantages and disadvantages of UBI in the Timorese context
- Evaluate the potential impacts of UBI on poverty reduction and inequality in Timor-Leste
- Design a basic UBI program for a specific region in Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Think-Pair-Share: 
- Think: Students individually list 3 key features of UBI and 3 features of existing transfer programs in Timor-Leste
- Pair: Students share their lists with a partner, discussing similarities and differences
- Share: Pairs share their insights with the class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Define and discuss the following terms:
- Universal Basic Income (UBI)
- Conditional Cash Transfer
- Means-testing
- Administrative efficiency
- Program targeting
- Poverty reduction
- Income inequality

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of existing social welfare programs in Timor-Leste
- Key features of UBI and how they differ from current programs
- Potential advantages of UBI in the Timorese context:
  * Reduced administrative costs
  * Improved coverage and reduced stigma
  * Potential for poverty reduction and decreased inequality
- Potential disadvantages and challenges:
  * High fiscal costs
  * Potential labor market distortions
  * Implementation challenges in rural areas

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

1. Comparative Analysis Exercise:
   - In small groups, students complete a table comparing UBI with existing programs in Timor-Leste across various criteria (e.g., eligibility, conditionality, administrative costs)
   - Groups present their findings to the class

2. Case Study Analysis:
   - Students read a short case study on a social welfare program in Timor-Leste
   - They identify how UBI might address challenges faced by the existing program

## 7. Production Task (45 minutes)

Group Project: Design a UBI Program
- Divide the class into groups, each assigned a specific region in Timor-Leste
- Groups design a basic UBI program for their region, considering:
  * Payment amount and frequency
  * Eligibility criteria
  * Funding mechanisms
  * Implementation strategy
  * Potential impacts on poverty and inequality
- Groups create a poster or digital presentation of their UBI design

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Groups briefly present their UBI designs
- Class discussion on common themes and challenges identified
- Quick review quiz on key concepts covered in the lesson

## 9. Homework Assignment

1. Research Paper: Students write a 2-page paper analyzing how UBI could address specific gaps in Timor-Leste's current social protection system
2. Preparation for Next Class: Students interview 2-3 community members about their views on UBI and existing welfare programs
