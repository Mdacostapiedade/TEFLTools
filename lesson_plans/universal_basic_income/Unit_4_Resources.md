# Lecture Notes

## Comparative Analysis of UBI and Existing Programs

### Overview of Timor-Leste's Current Social Welfare Programs

- Bolsa da Mãe: Conditional cash transfer program for poor households with children
- Elderly Pension: Non-contributory pension for citizens aged 60 and above
- Disability Pension: Monthly cash transfer for people with disabilities
- Veterans' Pension: Payments to veterans of the independence struggle

### Key Features of UBI

- Universality: Provided to all citizens or residents
- Unconditionality: No requirements or means-testing
- Regularity: Paid at consistent intervals
- Cash-based: Direct monetary transfers

### Comparison Table

| Feature | UBI | Existing Programs |
|---------|-----|-------------------|
| Coverage | Universal | Targeted |
| Conditionality | Unconditional | Often conditional |
| Administration | Simplified | Complex |
| Stigma | Reduced | Can be stigmatizing |
| Cost | Potentially higher | Varies |
| Flexibility for recipients | High | Often restricted |

## Potential Impacts on Poverty Reduction and Inequality

### Poverty Reduction

- Direct income support to all citizens
- Potential to raise incomes above poverty line
- May provide economic security and enable risk-taking

### Inequality Reduction

- Progressive nature if funded through taxation
- Proportionally larger impact on lower-income groups
- Potential to reduce wealth concentration over time

### Challenges in the Timorese Context

- High poverty rate (41.8% in 2014) may require substantial UBI amount
- Limited formal banking infrastructure in rural areas
- Potential inflationary effects in local economies

## Administrative Efficiency and Program Costs

### Efficiency Gains

- Reduced bureaucracy in determining eligibility
- Lower administrative costs due to universality
- Simplified distribution through digital payments

### Cost Considerations

- Potentially high fiscal cost due to universality
- Need for sustainable funding sources (e.g., oil and gas revenues, taxation)
- Trade-offs with other public expenditures

### Implementation Challenges

- Developing robust identification and payment systems
- Ensuring access in remote areas
- Managing transition from existing programs

# Discussion Questions

1. How might UBI address the limitations of current targeted welfare programs in Timor-Leste?
2. What are the potential economic and social impacts of providing a basic income to all Timorese citizens?
3. How could UBI affect labor market participation and informal employment in Timor-Leste?
4. What are the main challenges in implementing UBI in Timor-Leste, and how might they be addressed?
5. How could UBI be funded sustainably in Timor-Leste, considering its current economic structure and resources?
6. What might be the gender implications of implementing UBI in Timor-Leste?
7. How could UBI impact rural-urban migration patterns in Timor-Leste?
8. What are the potential risks of replacing existing targeted programs with a UBI in Timor-Leste?

# Assignment Details

## Group Project: Design a UBI Program for a Specific Region in Timor-Leste

### Objectives:
- Apply theoretical knowledge to a practical context
- Develop region-specific UBI proposals
- Consider implementation challenges and solutions

### Instructions:
1. Form groups of 3-4 students
2. Each group will be assigned a specific region in Timor-Leste (e.g., Dili, Baucau, Oecusse)
3. Research the assigned region's demographics, economic conditions, and current social welfare programs
4. Design a UBI program tailored to the region, addressing:
   - Payment amount and frequency
   - Eligibility criteria (if any)
   - Funding mechanisms
   - Implementation strategy
   - Potential impacts on poverty and inequality
5. Create a poster or digital presentation (10-15 slides) outlining your UBI design
6. Prepare a 10-minute presentation to deliver to the class

### Deliverables:
- Poster or digital presentation
- 10-minute group presentation
- 2-page written summary of the UBI design and rationale

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Thoroughness of research on the assigned region
- Feasibility and appropriateness of the UBI design
- Consideration of potential impacts and challenges
- Quality of presentation and supporting materials
- Teamwork and equal contribution of group members

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Bolsa da Mãe Program in Timor-Leste

The Bolsa da Mãe program, introduced in 2008, is a conditional cash transfer program aimed at supporting poor households with children. Key features include:

- Target group: Poor households with children aged 0-17
- Conditionality: School attendance and health check-ups for children
- Payment: $5 per child per month, up to three children per household
- Coverage: Approximately 55,000 households as of 2019

Challenges:
- Limited coverage due to budget constraints
- Difficulties in accurately identifying eligible households
- Monitoring compliance with conditions in remote areas
- Limited impact on overall poverty reduction

Question for analysis: How might a UBI address these challenges, and what new challenges might it introduce?

## Excerpt from "Exploring Universal Basic Income: A Guide to Navigating Concepts, Evidence, and Practices"

"The idea of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) is gaining traction in both developed and developing countries as a potential tool to address poverty, inequality, and the changing nature of work. However, implementing UBI in a developing country context presents unique challenges and opportunities. Policymakers must carefully consider the fiscal implications, potential labor market effects, and the existing social protection landscape when designing a UBI program. In countries with limited administrative capacity and high levels of informality, UBI may offer advantages in terms of reduced administrative costs and improved coverage. However, the high fiscal cost of a true UBI may necessitate careful consideration of funding sources and potential trade-offs with other public expenditures."

(Gentilini et al., 2020, p. 15)
