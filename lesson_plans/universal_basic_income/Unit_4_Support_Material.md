   Solution: Encourage students to draw parallels from UBI studies in similar developing countries

3. Challenge: Students struggle to understand complex economic concepts
   Solution: Use real-life examples and simplified simulations to illustrate economic principles

4. Challenge: Engaging students in policy design may be challenging
   Solution: Use role-playing exercises where students take on different stakeholder perspectives

5. Challenge: Balancing theoretical knowledge with practical applications
   Solution: Incorporate case studies and invite guest speakers from local NGOs or government agencies

6. Challenge: Students may have varying levels of familiarity with Timor-Leste's social welfare system
   Solution: Provide a comprehensive overview at the beginning and use peer teaching to leverage diverse knowledge
