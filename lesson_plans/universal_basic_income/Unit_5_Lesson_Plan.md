## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Estimate the cost of implementing UBI in Timor-Leste
- Identify potential funding sources for UBI in Timor-Leste
- Analyze the macroeconomic effects of UBI on inflation, consumption, and savings
- Develop a basic budget proposal for UBI implementation

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Quick poll: Ask students to estimate what percentage of Timor-Leste's GDP they think would be required to fund a UBI program. Write estimates on the board and discuss briefly.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

- Fiscal space
- Revenue streams
- Macroeconomic effects
- Inflation
- Marginal propensity to consume
- Sovereign wealth fund

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### Cost Estimates for UBI in Timor-Leste
- Present different UBI amount scenarios and their total costs
- Compare costs to current GDP and government budget

### Potential Funding Sources
- Overview of Timor-Leste's current revenue streams
- Focus on oil and gas revenues and the Petroleum Fund
- Discuss potential new taxation methods

### Macroeconomic Effects
- Explain potential impacts on inflation
- Discuss changes in consumption patterns and savings rates
- Address concerns about Dutch disease

## 6. Practice Activities (30 minutes)

### Activity 1: Cost Calculation
In pairs, students calculate the total cost of a UBI program using different monthly payment amounts and Timor-Leste's population data.

### Activity 2: Funding Source Analysis
In small groups, students analyze handouts with Timor-Leste's revenue data to identify potential funding sources for UBI, considering sustainability and economic impact.

## 7. Production Tasks (40 minutes)

### Budget Proposal Development
In groups of 3-4, students develop a basic budget proposal for UBI implementation in Timor-Leste, including:
- Proposed UBI amount
- Total cost calculation
- Identified funding sources
- Brief explanation of economic rationale

Groups present their proposals to the class for feedback.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points about fiscal requirements and economic impacts of UBI
- Address any remaining questions from students
- Preview next lesson on labor market effects

## 9. Homework Assignment

Students write a 500-word reflection on the challenges and opportunities of funding UBI in Timor-Leste, incorporating concepts from the lesson and their own research.
