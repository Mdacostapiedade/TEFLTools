## Cost Estimates for UBI in Timor-Leste

### Overview
- UBI cost depends on payment amount and population size
- Timor-Leste population: approximately 1.3 million (2021 estimate)
- Various scenarios to consider:
  1. Low-end UBI: $50 per month
  2. Mid-range UBI: $100 per month
  3. High-end UBI: $200 per month

### Calculations
1. Low-end UBI ($50/month):
   - Annual cost per person: $50 * 12 = $600
   - Total annual cost: $600 * 1,300,000 = $780 million
2. Mid-range UBI ($100/month):
   - Annual cost per person: $100 * 12 = $1,200
   - Total annual cost: $1,200 * 1,300,000 = $1.56 billion
3. High-end UBI ($200/month):
   - Annual cost per person: $200 * 12 = $2,400
   - Total annual cost: $2,400 * 1,300,000 = $3.12 billion

### Context
- Timor-Leste's GDP (2020): approximately $1.9 billion
- Government budget (2021): approximately $1.9 billion
- Petroleum Fund balance (2021): approximately $19 billion

## Potential Funding Sources

### Current Revenue Streams
1. Petroleum Fund
   - Primary source of government revenue
   - Sustainable spending rule: 3% of total petroleum wealth annually
2. Domestic revenues
   - Taxes (income, corporate, excise, import duties)
   - Non-tax revenues (fees, charges)

### Oil and Gas Revenues
- Bayu-Undan field (declining production)
- Greater Sunrise field (potential future revenue)
- Challenges: price volatility, finite resource

### Potential New Taxation Methods
1. Progressive income tax
2. Wealth tax
3. Carbon tax
4. Financial transaction tax

### Considerations
- Sustainability of funding sources
- Impact on economic growth and diversification
- Political feasibility

## Macroeconomic Effects

### Inflation
- Potential increase due to higher money supply
- Mitigating factors: increased production, import capacity

### Consumption Patterns
- Likely increase in overall consumption
- Shift towards essential goods and services
- Potential boost to local businesses

### Savings Rates
- Possible increase in savings for lower-income groups
- Potential decrease in precautionary savings

### Dutch Disease Concerns
- Risk of currency appreciation
- Potential negative impact on non-oil exports
- Importance of economic diversification strategies

# Discussion Questions

1. How might the implementation of UBI affect Timor-Leste's reliance on its Petroleum Fund? What are the long-term implications?

2. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of using new taxation methods to fund UBI in Timor-Leste? Consider both economic and political factors.

3. How might UBI impact income inequality in Timor-Leste? Consider both direct effects of cash transfers and potential indirect effects on the labor market and economy.

4. What strategies could Timor-Leste employ to mitigate potential inflationary effects of UBI implementation?

5. How might UBI affect rural vs. urban populations in Timor-Leste differently? What considerations should be made in policy design to address these differences?

6. Discuss the potential impacts of UBI on Timor-Leste's informal economy. How might it affect participation rates and overall economic activity?

7. What are the potential risks and benefits of using oil and gas revenues to fund UBI in Timor-Leste? How might this approach impact long-term economic sustainability?

8. How could the implementation of UBI affect Timor-Leste's efforts towards economic diversification? Consider both positive and negative potential outcomes.

## Example UBI Cost Calculation

Scenario: $100 monthly UBI payment

Step 1: Calculate annual cost per person
Annual cost per person = Monthly payment * 12 months
Annual cost per person = $100 * 12 = $1,200

Step 2: Calculate total annual cost for entire population
Total annual cost = Annual cost per person * Population
Total annual cost = $1,200 * 1,300,000 = $1,560,000,000 ($1.56 billion)

Step 3: Compare to GDP and government budget
Percentage of GDP = (Total annual cost / GDP) * 100
Percentage of GDP = ($1.56 billion / $1.9 billion) * 100 = 82.1%

Percentage of government budget = (Total annual cost / Government budget) * 100
Percentage of government budget = ($1.56 billion / $1.9 billion) * 100 = 82.1%

Conclusion: A $100 monthly UBI would cost approximately 82.1% of Timor-Leste's GDP and current government budget.
