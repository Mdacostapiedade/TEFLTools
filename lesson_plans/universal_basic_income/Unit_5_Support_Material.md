# 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with the complex economic concepts.
   - **Solution**: Use simplified explanations and real-world examples. Encourage peer teaching and group discussions.

2. **Challenge**: Limited availability of up-to-date economic data for Timor-Leste.
   - **Solution**: Use the most recent available data, and discuss the importance of estimates and projections in economic analysis.

3. **Challenge**: Students may have preconceived notions about UBI.
   - **Solution**: Encourage open discussion and critical thinking. Present balanced arguments for and against UBI.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in relating global UBI concepts to Timor-Leste's specific context.
   - **Solution**: Consistently bring discussions back to Timor-Leste's unique economic and social situation. Use local examples and scenarios.

5. **Challenge**: Students may struggle with the budget proposal development task.
   - **Solution**: Provide a clear template and step-by-step guidance. Consider doing a sample proposal as a class before group work.

6. **Challenge**: Engaging students with diverse economic backgrounds.
   - **Solution**: Use differentiated instruction techniques, pair stronger students with those who need more support, and provide additional resources for advanced learners.
