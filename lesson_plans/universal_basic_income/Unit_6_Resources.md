## Labor Supply and Demand Effects of UBI

### Theoretical Impacts on Labor Supply

- Income effect: UBI provides additional non-labor income, which may reduce labor supply as individuals can maintain the same standard of living with less work.
- Substitution effect: UBI may increase labor supply by making work more attractive, as individuals keep more of their earnings without losing benefits.
- Net effect depends on which effect dominates and varies across different segments of the population.

### Potential Changes in Labor Demand

- Increased consumer spending from UBI may boost demand for goods and services, potentially increasing labor demand.
- Employers might offer lower wages, knowing workers have a basic income to fall back on.
- Some businesses may automate more aggressively if labor costs increase due to workers' increased bargaining power.

## Impacts on Formal and Informal Employment in Timor-Leste

### Current State of Formal and Informal Employment

- Timor-Leste's labor market is characterized by a large informal sector.
- Formal sector primarily consists of public sector employment and limited private sector jobs in urban areas.
- Informal sector includes subsistence agriculture, small-scale trading, and various unregistered businesses.

### Potential Shifts Between Sectors with UBI

- UBI may provide a safety net, encouraging more risk-taking and transitions from informal to formal employment.
- Some workers might move from formal to informal sector, using UBI as a cushion to pursue entrepreneurial activities.
- UBI could support formalization by providing resources for business registration and compliance with regulations.

## Effects on Entrepreneurship and Self-Employment

### UBI and Risk-Taking

- UBI can act as a form of insurance, potentially encouraging more people to start businesses.
- Reduced fear of destitution may lead to increased innovation and risk-taking in business ventures.

### Impacts on Informal Microenterprises

- UBI could provide capital for informal businesses to expand or formalize.
- May lead to increased competition in the informal sector as more individuals have resources to start small businesses.

### Potential Changes in Self-Employment Patterns

- UBI might enable more people to pursue freelance or gig economy work.
- Could support traditional craftspeople and artisans by providing a basic income during low-demand periods.
