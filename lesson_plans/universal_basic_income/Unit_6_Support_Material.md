     * What were the main effects on labor supply?
     * How did it impact entrepreneurship?
     * What differences do you see between this context and Timor-Leste?
     * What lessons can be applied to Timor-Leste?

# 5. Tips for Teachers

1. Potential Challenges and Solutions:
   - Challenge: Students may have preconceived notions about UBI
     Solution: Start with a myth-busting activity to address common misconceptions

   - Challenge: Difficulty in relating global UBI examples to Timor-Leste's context
     Solution: Always bring discussions back to Timor-Leste's unique economic and social situation

   - Challenge: Complexity of economic concepts
     Solution: Use real-life examples and simplified models to illustrate key points

2. Engagement Strategies:
   - Encourage debate and discussion to explore different perspectives
   - Use local case studies and examples to make content more relevant
   - Incorporate hands-on activities like the survey design to apply learning

3. Differentiation:
   - Provide additional support materials for students struggling with economic concepts
   - Offer extension activities for advanced students, such as more in-depth policy analysis

4. Assessment Ideas:
   - Use exit tickets to check understanding at the end of each section
   - Assign a mini-research project on a specific aspect of UBI in Timor-Leste
   - Conduct a mock policy presentation where students argue for or against UBI implementation
