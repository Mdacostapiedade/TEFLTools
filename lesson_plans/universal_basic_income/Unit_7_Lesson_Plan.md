# Lesson Plan: UBI Policy Design and Implementation in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Laptops/tablets with internet access
- Projector and screen
- Whiteboard and markers
- Printed handouts of Timor-Leste's current social protection programs
- Copies of relevant sections from Gentilini et al. (2020) and Standing (2017)
- Flipchart paper and markers for group work

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify key policy design considerations for implementing UBI in Timor-Leste
- Analyze potential implementation challenges specific to Timor-Leste's context
- Develop strategies to address UBI implementation challenges
- Create a basic policy brief outlining a UBI implementation plan for Timor-Leste

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Quick think-pair-share: Students discuss with a partner what they think would be the biggest challenge in implementing UBI in Timor-Leste. Share a few responses with the class.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary and Concepts (15 minutes)

- Introduce and define key terms:
  - Policy design
  - Implementation challenges
  - Financial inclusion
  - Infrastructure constraints
  - Monitoring and evaluation
- Brief overview of Timor-Leste's current social protection system

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Lecture and discussion on:
  - UBI policy design options for Timor-Leste
    - Payment amount and frequency
    - Eligibility criteria
    - Funding mechanisms
  - Implementation challenges specific to Timor-Leste
    - Limited banking infrastructure
    - Rural vs. urban population differences
    - Literacy rates and financial education needs
  - Strategies for monitoring and evaluating UBI in Timor-Leste

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

- Small group activity: Students are divided into groups and assigned a specific implementation challenge (e.g., financial inclusion, infrastructure, monitoring). Groups brainstorm potential solutions and present to the class.
- Class discussion: Compare and contrast proposed solutions, considering feasibility in Timor-Leste's context.

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- Individual task: Students begin drafting a policy brief on UBI implementation for Timor-Leste, focusing on:
  - Key policy design features
  - Addressing main implementation challenges
  - Proposed monitoring and evaluation strategy
- Peer review: Students exchange drafts with a partner for feedback and suggestions

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Quick quiz: Multiple choice questions on key policy design and implementation concepts
- Class discussion: What are the most critical factors for successful UBI implementation in Timor-Leste?

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Complete the policy brief on UBI implementation for Timor-Leste (2-3 pages)
- Read assigned sections from Gentilini et al. (2020) on UBI implementation case studies
- Prepare a 5-minute presentation on one implementation challenge and proposed solution for next class

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Policy design: The process of creating and structuring a policy to achieve specific objectives
- Implementation challenges: Obstacles or difficulties encountered when putting a policy into practice
- Financial inclusion: The availability and equality of opportunities to access financial services
