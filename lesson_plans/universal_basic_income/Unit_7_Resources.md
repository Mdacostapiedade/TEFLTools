## UBI Policy Design Options for Timor-Leste

### Payment Amount and Frequency
- Considerations for determining payment amount:

- Current literacy statistics in Timor-Leste
- Strategies for financial education:
  - Partnerships with schools and community organizations
  - Simplified, visual educational materials
- Importance of multi-lingual communication:
  - Materials in Tetum, Portuguese, and local languages

## Monitoring and Evaluation Strategies

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Poverty reduction metrics:
  - Changes in poverty headcount ratio
  - Improvements in depth of poverty
- Economic impact measures:
  - Local economic activity and business creation
  - Changes in formal and informal employment
- Social and health indicators:
  - School enrollment and attendance rates
  - Healthcare utilization and health outcomes

### Data Collection Methods
- Household surveys:
  - Baseline and regular follow-up surveys
  - Collaboration with national statistics office
- Administrative data:
  - Payment distribution records
  - Integration with other government databases
- Qualitative assessments:
  - Focus groups and interviews with recipients
  - Case studies of individual and community impacts

### Evaluation Design
- Randomized controlled trials:
  - Ethical considerations in UBI context
  - Potential for phased implementation to allow for comparison
- Longitudinal studies:
  - Tracking long-term impacts on individuals and communities
  - Importance of consistent data collection over time

# Discussion Questions

1. How should Timor-Leste balance the use of its Petroleum Fund for UBI with the need for long-term sustainability?

2. What are the pros and cons of a truly universal UBI in Timor-Leste versus a targeted approach? How might this impact social cohesion?

3. Given Timor-Leste's limited banking infrastructure, what innovative payment distribution methods could be employed for UBI?

4. How can UBI implementation address the differing needs and challenges of rural and urban populations in Timor-Leste?

5. What role should international organizations play in funding or supporting a UBI program in Timor-Leste? How might this impact national sovereignty?

6. How can Timor-Leste ensure that UBI doesn't create disincentives for formal employment or economic development?

7. What strategies could be employed to provide financial education alongside UBI implementation, particularly in areas with low literacy rates?

8. How might UBI impact traditional social structures and support systems in Timorese communities?

9. What are the potential gender implications of UBI in Timor-Leste, and how can the policy be designed to promote gender equality?

10. How can Timor-Leste design a monitoring and evaluation system that captures both the quantitative and qualitative impacts of UBI?

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Brazil's Bolsa Família Program

### Overview
Bolsa Família is a conditional cash transfer program in Brazil that provides financial aid to poor families. While not a UBI, it offers valuable lessons for large-scale cash transfer programs in developing countries.

### Key Features
- Targets low-income families
- Conditional on children's school attendance and health check-ups
- Payments made primarily to women in the household

### Outcomes
- Reduced poverty and inequality
- Improved school enrollment and attendance
- Enhanced vaccination rates and use of preventive health services

### Lessons for Timor-Leste
- Importance of strong administrative systems
- Benefits of linking payments to social objectives
- Potential for empowering women through payment structure

## Sample UBI Payment Calculation for Timor-Leste

### Assumptions
- Population: 1.3 million
- GDP per capita: $2,000 USD
- Poverty line: $1.90 per day

### Calculation
1. Annual UBI at 20% of GDP per capita:
   - 0.20 * $2,000 = $400 per person per year
2. Monthly payment:
   - $400 / 12 = $33.33 per person per month
3. Total annual cost:
   - $400 * 1,300,000 = $520 million

### Considerations
- Represents approximately 20% of Timor-Leste's GDP
- Would lift all individuals above the extreme poverty line
- Need to consider sustainability and funding sources
