# 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Limited student knowledge of Timor-Leste's context:
   - Provide a brief overview of Timor-Leste's economic and social situation at the beginning of the lesson.
   - Encourage students to research and share interesting facts about Timor-Leste.

2. Difficulty in understanding complex policy design concepts:
   - Use simple analogies and real-world examples to explain policy design elements.
   - Encourage peer teaching and group discussions to reinforce understanding.

3. Lack of engagement in theoretical discussions:
   - Incorporate interactive activities, such as role-playing exercises or simulations.
   - Use case studies and real-world examples to make concepts more relatable.

4. Challenges in critical thinking about implementation issues:
   - Provide structured frameworks (like the Implementation Challenge Analysis Worksheet) to guide thinking.
   - Encourage students to draw from their own experiences or observations of social programs.

5. Time management for group activities:
   - Clearly communicate time limits for each activity.
   - Assign roles within groups to ensure efficient use of time.
   - Have additional discussion questions or activities prepared in case groups finish early.

6. Difficulty in applying concepts to policy brief writing:
   - Provide clear guidelines and a template for the policy brief.
   - Offer examples of well-written policy briefs for reference.
   - Consider a peer review process to help students improve their drafts.
