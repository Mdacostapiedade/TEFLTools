# Lecture Notes

## Sources and Types of Weapons in Circulation

### Main Sources of Weapons in Timor-Leste
- Leftovers from Indonesian occupation and independence conflict
- Leakage from police and military stockpiles
- Smuggling across porous borders, especially from Indonesia

### Types of Weapons
- Military-style weapons: M16 rifles, AK-47s
- Handguns: Various pistols and revolvers
- Homemade weapons: "rakitan" guns
- Grenades and other small explosives
- Traditional weapons: machetes, spears

### Estimated Numbers
- 2006 crisis: Approx. 3,000-4,000 weapons looted from police/military
- Current estimates: 10,000-15,000 illicit small arms in circulation (Small Arms Survey)

## Weapons Collection Programs

### Operation Kilat (2006-2007)
- Joint UN-Timorese effort after 2006 crisis
- Recovered over 1,700 weapons and 30,000 rounds of ammunition
- Challenges: Limited reach outside Dili, lack of incentives

### Community-Based Weapons Collection (2008-2010)
- Focused on rural areas
- Used traditional leaders and rituals in collection process
- Results: Over 900 weapons collected

### Effectiveness Challenges
- Lack of comprehensive database on missing weapons
- Limited resources for outreach and collection
- Distrust between communities and security forces
- Ongoing demand for weapons due to insecurity

## Legal Framework for Arms Control

### Law on Arms and Ammunition (2011)
- Prohibits civilian possession of firearms
- Establishes licensing system for security companies
- Criminalizes illegal weapons possession and trafficking

### Implementation Challenges
- Limited capacity for enforcement
- Corruption within security forces
- Porous borders complicating control efforts

# Discussion Questions

1. What factors contribute to the ongoing demand for small arms in Timor-Leste despite official prohibitions?

2. How might traditional cultural practices be leveraged to improve weapons collection efforts?

3. What are the potential risks and benefits of involving ex-combatants in weapons collection programs?

4. How does the proliferation of small arms impact different segments of Timorese society (e.g. women, youth, rural communities)?

5. What role should international actors play in supporting Timor-Leste's efforts to control small arms?

# Writing Exercise

Write a 500-word policy brief proposing a new weapons collection initiative for Timor-Leste. Your brief should include:

1. A clear statement of the problem
2. Objectives of the proposed initiative
3. Key components of the program
4. Potential challenges and how they will be addressed
5. Expected outcomes and how they will be measured

Consider lessons learned from past efforts and incorporate culturally appropriate strategies.

# Case Study Analysis Assignment

Read the following case study on a community-based weapons collection program in Manufahi district. In small groups, analyze the program using the following questions:

1. What were the key strengths of this approach?
2. What challenges did the program face?
3. How effective was the use of traditional rituals in the collection process?
4. What lessons can be drawn for future weapons collection efforts?
5. How might this approach be adapted for use in urban areas?

Prepare a 10-minute presentation of your findings to share with the class.

# Debate Preparation Materials

## Motion: "Civilian gun ownership should be legalized in Timor-Leste"

### Pro Arguments
- Self-defense in areas with limited police presence
- Potential deterrent effect on crime
- Cultural significance of weapons ownership for some groups
- Economic opportunities through hunting/sport shooting

### Con Arguments
- Risk of increased violence and accidents
- Challenges for law enforcement and security
- Potential for weapons to be used in communal conflicts
- Negative impacts on post-conflict reconciliation efforts

### Key Statistics
- Homicide rates in countries with different gun laws
- Survey data on Timorese attitudes toward civilian gun ownership
- Costs of gun violence in comparable countries

## Excerpts from Timor-Leste Armed Violence Assessment Final Report

"The legacy of conflict and occupation has left Timor-Leste awash with small arms and light weapons. While the exact number of weapons in circulation is unknown, conservative estimates suggest there are between 10,000-15,000 weapons outside of state control."

"Weapons collection efforts have yielded mixed results. While thousands of weapons have been recovered, the lack of a comprehensive baseline and ongoing leakage from state stockpiles makes it difficult to assess the overall impact on reducing arms availability."
