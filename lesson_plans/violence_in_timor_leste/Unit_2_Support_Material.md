3. Local context: If possible, invite a guest speaker with firsthand experience in Timor-Leste's weapons collection efforts to provide real-world insights.

4. Debate preparation: Assign roles randomly to encourage students to consider multiple perspectives, regardless of personal views.

5. Visual learners: Use the provided diagrams and encourage students to create their own visual representations of key concepts.

6. Language support: Provide additional explanation of technical terms, especially for students who may not be native English speakers.
