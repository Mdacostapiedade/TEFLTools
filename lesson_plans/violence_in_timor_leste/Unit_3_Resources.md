## Typology of Armed Groups in Timor-Leste

### Martial Arts Groups
- Originated from Indonesian-era self-defense groups
- Estimated 15-20 major groups with 20,000+ members
- Examples: PSHT, Kera Sakti, KORK
- Activities: training, social events, sometimes violent clashes
- Often have political affiliations

### Veterans Groups
- Composed of former resistance fighters
- Examples: Sagrada Familia, CPD-RDTL
- Advocate for veterans' rights and benefits
- Some involved in political activities or protests

### Clandestine Groups
- Roots in independence struggle networks
- Often secretive and maintain hierarchical structures
- Examples: 7-7, Colimau 2000
- Activities range from cultural preservation to alleged criminal acts

### Youth Gangs
- Often neighborhood-based
- May overlap with martial arts group membership
- Involved in petty crime, protection rackets, street violence

## Causes of Group Violence

1. Unemployment and economic marginalization
   - High youth unemployment (~ 40%)
   - Limited economic opportunities in rural areas

2. Weak state institutions
   - Limited police capacity to respond to violence
   - Perceived corruption and political interference

3. Historical trauma and unresolved conflicts
   - Lingering impacts of occupation and resistance
   - Incomplete reconciliation processes

4. Land disputes
   - Unclear land ownership due to colonial legacies
   - Conflicts between customary and formal legal systems

5. Political manipulation
   - Groups mobilized by political actors for support/intimidation
   - Promise of patronage and access to resources

## Impacts of Group Violence

1. Physical security
   - Injuries and deaths from group clashes
   - Property damage and displacement

2. Social cohesion
   - Breakdown of trust between communities
   - Reinforcement of group identities and divisions

3. Economic development
   - Disruption of markets and trade
   - Deterrent to foreign investment

4. Political stability
   - Undermining of democratic processes
   - Erosion of state legitimacy

5. Youth development
   - Cycle of violence and limited opportunities
   - Trauma and psychological impacts

## Links Between Armed Groups and Political Actors

1. Historical connections
   - Many groups have roots in resistance-era networks
   - Leaders often have personal ties to political figures

2. Patronage relationships
   - Groups provide political support/mobilization
   - Politicians offer protection, resources, contracts

3. Infiltration of state institutions
   - Group members recruited into security forces
   - Blurred lines between state and non-state actors

4. Electoral manipulation
   - Intimidation of voters or rival candidates
   - Mobilization of supporters for rallies/events

5. Policy influence
   - Lobbying for group interests (e.g. veterans' benefits)
   - Threat of violence as leverage in negotiations

## Government Responses

1. Legal measures
   - 2008 law regulating martial arts groups
   - 2013 resolution banning certain martial arts groups

2. Security operations
   - Joint police-military operations to disrupt group activities
   - Arrests of group leaders involved in violence

3. Dialogue and negotiation
   - Attempts to engage group leaders in peace processes
   - Mixed results due to fragmented nature of groups

4. Youth programs
   - Vocational training and employment initiatives
   - Limited reach and sustainability challenges

5. Institutional reforms
   - Efforts to professionalize police and military
   - Challenges with political interference and resource constraints

# Discussion Questions

1. How do the different types of armed groups in Timor-Leste (martial arts groups, veterans groups, clandestine groups) compare in terms of their origins, structures, and activities?

2. What are the primary factors contributing to group violence in Timor-Leste? How do these factors intersect and reinforce each other?

3. Analyze the relationship between armed groups and political actors in Timor-Leste. How does this relationship impact governance and stability?

4. Evaluate the effectiveness of the government's ban on certain martial arts groups. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of this approach?

5. How does the prevalence of armed groups affect Timor-Leste's post-conflict peacebuilding and development efforts?

6. Compare the situation of armed groups in Timor-Leste to another post-conflict context you're familiar with. What similarities and differences do you observe?

7. What strategies could be employed to address the root causes of group violence in Timor-Leste? Consider both short-term and long-term approaches.

8. How does the existence of armed groups impact different segments of Timorese society (e.g. youth, women, rural communities)? 

9. Discuss the challenges of disarmament and reintegration in the context of Timor-Leste's armed groups. What lessons can be drawn from other DDR processes?

10. How might Timor-Leste's traditional conflict resolution mechanisms be leveraged to address group violence? What are the potential limitations of these approaches?

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Banning of Martial Arts Groups

In 2013, the Timor-Leste government passed Resolution 16, banning the practice and activities of certain martial arts groups, including PSHT, KORK, and Kera Sakti. This case study examines the context, implementation, and impacts of this ban.

### Background:
- Escalating violence between martial arts groups in 2011-2012
- Perception of groups as threats to national security
- Political pressure to take decisive action

### Implementation:
- Groups officially dissolved and activities prohibited
- Police operations to enforce ban and arrest violators
- Challenges with identifying group members and activities

### Impacts:
- Short-term reduction in visible group violence
- Groups going "underground" or rebranding
- Criticism from human rights organizations
- Potential alienation of youth from government

### Questions for consideration:
1. Was banning an effective strategy for reducing group violence?
2. What alternative approaches could have been considered?
3. How might the ban impact long-term peacebuilding efforts?

## Excerpt from Scambary (2019) on Political Patronage

"The intricate web of patronage relationships between political elites and armed groups in Timor-Leste has its roots in the clandestine resistance networks of the occupation era. These historical ties have evolved in the post-independence period, with groups providing political support and mobilization in exchange for access to resources and protection. This dynamic has blurred the lines between state and non-state actors, complicating efforts at security sector reform and democratic consolidation.

Political patrons may use armed groups to intimidate rivals, mobilize voters, or apply pressure during negotiations. In turn, group leaders leverage their capacity for mobilization to secure government contracts, jobs for members, or influence over policy decisions. This symbiotic relationship perpetuates a cycle of instability, as groups have a vested interest in maintaining their relevance through the threat of violence, while politicians rely on group support to maintain power.

Addressing this challenge requires a multifaceted approach that goes beyond security measures to tackle the underlying political economy of violence. This may include strengthening democratic institutions, creating economic alternatives for group members, and fostering a political culture that values peaceful competition over patronage-based mobilization."
