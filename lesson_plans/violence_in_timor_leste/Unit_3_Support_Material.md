# 5. Tips for Teachers

1. **Challenge**: Students may have limited background knowledge about Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Provide a brief historical overview at the beginning of the lesson and encourage students to research the country's history before class.

2. **Challenge**: Discussing violence and conflict may be sensitive for some students.
   **Solution**: Establish ground rules for respectful discussion and provide content warnings when necessary. Offer alternative assignments if needed.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to understand the complex relationships between armed groups and political actors.
   **Solution**: Use visual aids like network diagrams to illustrate these relationships. Provide concrete examples from recent Timorese history.

4. **Challenge**: The role-play negotiation activity may be challenging for some students.
   **Solution**: Provide clear instructions and scenario cards with detailed background information. Consider assigning roles based on students' comfort levels and abilities.

5. **Challenge**: Students may have difficulty relating to the context of post-conflict Timor-Leste.
   **Solution**: Draw parallels to other post-conflict societies or to gang violence in contexts students may be more familiar with. Emphasize universal themes of security, identity, and social cohesion.
