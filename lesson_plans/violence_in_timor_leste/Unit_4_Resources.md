## Data on Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in Timor-Leste

### Prevalence Rates
- 59% of ever-partnered women aged 15-49 have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime (Nabilan Health and Life Experiences Study, 2016)
- 14% of women reported experiencing non-partner sexual violence since age 15
- 77% of women believe a husband is justified in hitting his wife under certain circumstances

### Types of Violence
- Physical violence (slapping, hitting, kicking)
- Sexual violence (forced intercourse, unwanted sexual acts)
- Emotional abuse (insults, humiliation, threats)
- Economic abuse (denying access to financial resources)

### Demographic Patterns
- Higher rates of violence reported in rural areas
- Women with lower education levels at greater risk
- Younger women (15-19) report higher rates of recent violence

## Cultural Factors Contributing to GBV

### Traditional Gender Roles
- Patriarchal society with men as heads of household
- Women expected to be submissive and obedient
- Limited decision-making power for women in family and community

### Bride Price Practices
- Payment of "barlake" (dowry) from groom's family to bride's family
- Can lead to perception of wives as property
- May increase tolerance of violence against wives

### Acceptance of Domestic Violence
- Violence often seen as a private family matter
- Police reluctant to intervene in domestic disputes
- Community pressure to reconcile rather than seek justice

## Government and NGO Programs Addressing GBV

### Government Initiatives
- Law Against Domestic Violence (2010)
- National Action Plan on Gender-Based Violence (2017-2021)
- Establishment of Vulnerable Persons Units in police stations

### NGO Support Services
- PRADET: Psychosocial support and safe house for survivors
- Fokupers: Legal aid and advocacy for women's rights
- JSMP: Court monitoring and legal education on GBV laws

### Public Awareness Campaigns
- "Hapara Violensia Kontra Feto" (Stop Violence Against Women) campaign
- 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence annual events
- Community-based education on women's rights and GBV prevention

## Case Study: Maria's Story

Maria is a 28-year-old woman living in a rural village in Timor-Leste. She is married with two young children. Her husband, João, works as a farmer and often drinks heavily. When intoxicated, João becomes verbally abusive and sometimes hits Maria. She has considered leaving him but fears she cannot support herself and her children alone. Maria's family tells her to be patient and that all marriages have problems. When she tried to report the abuse to the local police, they told her it was a private family matter and she should go home and reconcile with her husband. Maria feels trapped and doesn't know where to turn for help.

Questions for discussion:
1. What cultural and social factors contribute to Maria's situation?
2. What barriers does Maria face in seeking help?
3. How might existing services or programs support someone in Maria's position?
4. What policy or systemic changes could help prevent similar situations?
