## Overview of Timor-Leste's Security Institutions

### PNTL (Policia Nacional de Timor-Leste)
- Established in 2000 under UN administration
- Approximately 4,000 officers
- Responsible for internal security and law enforcement
- Organized into several units: patrol, investigations, border patrol, maritime
- Challenges: limited resources, inadequate training, politicization

### F-FDTL (FALINTIL-For√ßas de Defesa de Timor-Leste)
- Formed in 2001 from former FALINTIL resistance fighters
- Approximately 1,500 personnel
- Primary mission is defense against external threats
- Also assists in disaster relief and national development
- Challenges: defining clear role, civil-military relations, limited capabilities

## Key SSR Initiatives Since Independence

1. UN Police training and mentoring (2000-2012)
2. Screening and vetting of PNTL personnel (2006-2008)
3. Community policing program implementation (2008-present)
4. Development of national security policy and legislation (2010-2011)
5. Establishment of civilian oversight mechanisms (2009-present)

## Outcomes and Impacts of SSR Efforts

- Improved basic policing capabilities
- Enhanced legal framework for security sector governance
- Increased community engagement in some areas
- Gradual professionalization of PNTL and F-FDTL
- Reduced political violence since 2008

## Ongoing Challenges in SSR Implementation

1. Political interference in security institutions
2. Weak civilian oversight mechanisms
3. Limited institutional capacity and resources
4. Unclear delineation of roles between PNTL and F-FDTL
5. Persistence of martial arts groups and their influence
6. Inadequate accountability for human rights abuses
7. Gaps in legal framework for security sector governance

# Discussion Questions

2. What are the main differences between the roles of PNTL and F-FDTL? Are these roles clearly defined in practice?
3. How effective have international actors been in supporting SSR in Timor-Leste? What are the pros and cons of external involvement?
4. What are the key challenges in implementing community policing in Timor-Leste? How might these be addressed?
5. How can civilian oversight of security institutions be strengthened in Timor-Leste?
6. What role do martial arts groups play in Timor-Leste's security landscape? How should the government engage with these groups?
7. How has the politicization of security forces affected SSR efforts? What measures could reduce political interference?
8. In what ways might Timor-Leste's oil and gas revenues impact security sector development?
9. How can SSR initiatives better address gender issues within security institutions?
10. What lessons from Timor-Leste's SSR experience might be applicable to other post-conflict countries?

2. Research the SSR process in your chosen country, focusing on:
   - Key institutions reformed
   - Major initiatives and their outcomes
   - Role of international actors
   - Ongoing challenges
3. Create a Venn diagram comparing Timor-Leste's SSR process with that of your chosen country
4. In the overlapping section, identify common challenges and successful strategies
5. In the separate sections, highlight unique aspects of each country's SSR experience
6. Prepare a 5-minute presentation on your findings, including:

## Case Study: Community Policing in Timor-Leste

### Background
In 2008, the PNTL launched a community policing program aimed at building trust between police and local communities. The program focused on establishing Community Police Councils (CPCs) in each suco (village) to facilitate dialogue and collaborative problem-solving.

### Key Components
1. Regular community meetings with PNTL officers
2. Joint identification of local security issues
3. Collaborative development of solutions
4. Training for PNTL officers in community engagement
5. Youth outreach programs

### Outcomes
- Improved communication between police and communities in some areas
- Increased reporting of crimes in participating sucos
- Enhanced perception of police legitimacy among some community members
- Challenges in sustaining program due to resource constraints and officer rotations

### Discussion Points
1. How can the community policing program be scaled up effectively?
2. What cultural factors need to be considered in implementing community policing in Timor-Leste?
3. How can the program address issues of gender-based violence more effectively?
4. What role can traditional leaders play in supporting community policing efforts?
