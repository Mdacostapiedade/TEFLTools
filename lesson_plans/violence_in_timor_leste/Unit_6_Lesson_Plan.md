By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Define and explain the key components of DDR processes
2. Analyze Timor-Leste's experiences with DDR programs
3. Evaluate the challenges and successes of ex-combatant reintegration in Timor-Leste
4. Design a targeted vocational training program for ex-combatants

## Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

Think-Pair-Share: 
- Ask students to think individually about what challenges ex-combatants might face when returning to civilian life after conflict
- Have students pair up and share their ideas
- Discuss responses as a class and list key points on the whiteboard

## Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Define and discuss the following terms:
- Disarmament
- Demobilization
- Reintegration
- Ex-combatant
- Vocational training
- Psychosocial support

## Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Overview of DDR theory and practice
   - Definition and goals of DDR
   - Key components and stages
   - Best practices and common challenges

## Practice Activities (40 minutes)

1. Case study analysis (20 minutes):
   - Divide class into small groups

   - Groups analyze successes, challenges, and lessons learned
   - Each group presents key findings to the class

2. Problem-solving exercise (20 minutes):
   - In the same groups, students identify a key challenge in ex-combatant reintegration from their case study
   - Groups brainstorm potential solutions and interventions to address this challenge
   - Share ideas with the class and discuss feasibility

## Production Task (30 minutes)

Design a vocational training program for ex-combatants:
- Working in pairs, students develop a proposal for a vocational training program targeting ex-combatants in Timor-Leste
- Proposal should include:
  * Target group
  * Training objectives
  * Key skills to be developed
  * Duration and structure of program
  * Potential partners/implementers
  * Measures for monitoring success
- Pairs present their proposals to the class for feedback

## Wrap-up and Review (10 minutes)

- Recap key points of the lesson
- Discuss how DDR relates to broader peacebuilding efforts
- Q&A session for any remaining questions

## Homework Assignment

1. Research paper (1000 words):
   Compare and contrast Timor-Leste's DDR experience with that of another post-conflict country. Analyze similarities, differences, and lessons that could be applied to improve future DDR programs.

2. Reflection journal entry:
   Write a 1-page reflection on the challenges of reintegrating into civilian life from the perspective of an ex-combatant. Consider economic, social, and psychological factors.
