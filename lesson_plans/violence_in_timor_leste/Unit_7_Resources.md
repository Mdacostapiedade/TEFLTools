# Discussion Questions

1. How effective were Timor-Leste's reconciliation efforts in promoting healing and preventing future conflict?

2. What are the trade-offs between pursuing justice and promoting reconciliation in a post-conflict context?

3. How can civil society organizations maximize their impact on peacebuilding given limited resources?

4. Which root causes of conflict in Timor-Leste do you think are most critical to address for sustainable peace? Why?

5. How might lessons from Timor-Leste's experience be applied to other post-conflict contexts?

6. What role should international actors play in supporting long-term peacebuilding efforts?

7. How can peacebuilding initiatives effectively engage youth and address their specific needs/grievances?

8. What strategies could help strengthen national identity and social cohesion in a diverse post-conflict society?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflection Paper

Write a 500-word reflection paper on personal lessons learned from studying Timor-Leste's post-conflict experience. Consider the following questions:

1. What insights have you gained about the challenges of post-conflict peacebuilding?
2. How has your understanding of reconciliation and transitional justice evolved?
3. What aspects of Timor-Leste's experience do you think could be relevant to other contexts?
4. How might you apply these lessons in your future work or studies?

Your reflection should demonstrate critical thinking and make connections between course concepts and real-world application. Use specific examples from Timor-Leste to illustrate your points.

# Assignment Details

## Peacebuilding Initiative Design Project

In groups of 3-4, design a peacebuilding initiative to address a specific root cause of conflict in Timor-Leste. Your project should include:

1. Problem statement: Clearly define the root cause you're addressing and its impacts
2. Initiative overview: Describe your proposed intervention (goals, activities, timeline)
3. Stakeholder analysis: Identify key actors and their potential roles/interests
4. Implementation plan: Outline specific steps, resources needed, and potential challenges
5. Monitoring and evaluation: Propose indicators to measure the initiative's impact

Prepare a 10-minute presentation on your initiative for the class. Be prepared to answer questions and receive feedback from your peers and instructor.

## Case Study: Community Reconciliation Process

The Community Reconciliation Process (CRP) was a key component of CAVR's work. It aimed to reintegrate perpetrators of less serious crimes into their communities through traditional dispute resolution mechanisms.

Process:
1. Perpetrator submits statement admitting wrongdoing
2. Public hearing in community
3. Victims and community members speak
4. Panel determines "acts of reconciliation" (e.g. community service)
5. Perpetrator completes acts and receives immunity from prosecution

Example outcome: In Liqui√ßa district, a former militia member participated in a CRP. He admitted to assaulting several villagers in 1999 and stealing their property. After completing community service and returning stolen items, he was accepted back into the community. Victims reported feeling a sense of closure and healing.

Analyze the strengths and limitations of this approach to reconciliation. How might it be adapted for other contexts?

## Excerpt from CAVR "Chega!" Report

"The Commission believes that reconciliation can only be achieved if it:
- Is based on a clear understanding of the past, including the causes, nature and extent of human rights violations;
- Acknowledges the suffering of victims and the responsibility of perpetrators;
- Is linked to accountability, truth-telling and reparations;
- Builds on Timorese culture and traditions;
- Is a long-term process requiring ongoing commitment from all elements of society."

Discuss how well Timor-Leste's reconciliation efforts have aligned with these principles.
