   - Encourage critical analysis of both local and international approaches to peacebuilding.
   - Highlight the importance of local ownership and culturally appropriate solutions.

3. **Handling limited student background knowledge**:
   - Provide a brief historical overview at the beginning of the lesson to ensure all students have a basic understanding of Timor-Leste's context.
   - Consider assigning pre-reading materials to build background knowledge before the lesson.

4. **Encouraging critical thinking**:
   - Use open-ended questions and encourage students to consider multiple perspectives on peacebuilding strategies.
   - Challenge students to think beyond simplistic solutions and consider the complexities of post-conflict contexts.

5. **Managing time effectively**:
   - Be prepared to adjust the time allocated for activities based on student engagement and discussion.
   - Have additional discussion questions or short activities ready in case you finish earlier than expected.
