## 1. Lecture Notes

### History of Weaving in Timor-Leste

- Origins of weaving in Timor-Leste
  * Archaeological evidence suggests weaving dates back to at least 3500 BCE
  * Influenced by Austronesian migrations and trade

- Cultural significance
  * Tais: traditional woven cloth central to Timorese identity
  * Used in ceremonies, as gifts, and for daily wear
  * Patterns and motifs carry symbolic meanings

- Evolution of techniques
  * Traditional backstrap looms still widely used
  * Introduction of frame looms and floor looms in some areas
  * Preservation efforts to maintain traditional skills

### Basic Weaving Terminology

- Warp: Vertical threads on the loom
- Weft: Horizontal threads woven through the warp
- Shed: Space created between raised and lowered warp threads
- Shuttle: Tool used to carry weft thread across warp
- Loom: Frame or machine used for weaving fabric
- Heddle: Looped wire or cord used to separate and lift warp threads
- Selvedge: Finished edge of the fabric
- Pick: Single pass of weft thread across warp
- Reed: Comb-like device used to space warp threads evenly

### Types of Looms and Weaving Equipment

1. Backstrap Loom
   - Traditional loom used in Timor-Leste
   - Portable and adaptable
   - Components: backstrap, breast beam, shed rod, heddle rod

2. Frame Loom
   - Simple, rectangular loom
   - Good for beginners and small projects
   - Components: frame, nails or pegs for warping

3. Floor Loom
   - Larger, stationary loom
   - Allows for more complex weaves
   - Components: beams, shafts, treadles, reed

4. Additional Equipment
   - Shuttles: boat shuttle, stick shuttle
   - Beater or comb
   - Warping board
   - Bobbin winder
