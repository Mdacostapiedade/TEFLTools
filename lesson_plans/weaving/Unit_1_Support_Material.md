## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with manual dexterity for weaving
   - Tip: Start with very thick yarns and widely spaced warps for easier manipulation

2. Challenge: Difficulty understanding abstract weaving drafts
   - Tip: Use colored pencils to draw actual thread intersections on graph paper

3. Challenge: Maintaining consistent tension in weaving
   - Tip: Demonstrate and practice proper beater use; encourage frequent checking of edges

4. Challenge: Students becoming frustrated with slow progress
   - Tip: Set small, achievable goals; celebrate incremental progress

5. Challenge: Relating traditional techniques to modern applications
   - Tip: Show examples of contemporary textiles inspired by traditional Timorese designs

6. Challenge: Limited access to traditional looms
   - Tip: Create simple frame looms using picture frames or cardboard for individual practice

7. Challenge: Language barriers when discussing technical terms
   - Tip: Create a visual glossary with images alongside Tetum and English terms

8. Challenge: Varying skill levels within the class
   - Tip: Implement a peer mentoring system; provide extension activities for advanced students
