Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 2: Basic Weave Structures, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Basic Weave Structures

## 1. Resources Needed
- Small frame looms (one per student)
- Assorted yarns (cotton, wool, local plant fibers)
- Shuttles and pick-up sticks
- Samples of plain, twill, and satin weave fabrics
- Traditional Timorese textiles showcasing different weave structures
- Handouts with weave structure diagrams
- Projector and screen (if available)

## 2. Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand and create a plain weave structure
- Identify and analyze twill and satin weave structures
- Recognize basic weave structures in traditional Timorese textiles

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Fabric feel exercise: Pass around fabric samples with different weave structures. Ask students to describe how each fabric feels and looks, encouraging them to use descriptive language.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)
Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Warp
- Weft
- Shed
- Plain weave
- Twill weave
- Satin weave
- Float

Use visual aids and fabric samples to illustrate each term.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
- Introduce plain weave structure:
  * Explain the over-under pattern
  * Show diagrams and fabric samples
  * Discuss characteristics and uses of plain weave
- Present twill weave structure:
  * Explain the diagonal pattern and variations (2/2, 3/1, etc.)
  * Show diagrams and fabric samples
  * Discuss characteristics and uses of twill weave
- Introduce satin weave structure:
  * Explain the concept of floats and their arrangement
  * Show diagrams and fabric samples
  * Discuss characteristics and uses of satin weave

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Provide each group with fabric samples of different weave structures
- Have students analyze and identify the weave structures, discussing their observations
- Rotate samples among groups and compare findings

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)
- Demonstrate setting up a small frame loom for plain weave
- Guide students in warping their looms and beginning a plain weave sample
- Circulate to assist students and answer questions
- Challenge advanced students to experiment with simple patterns within the plain weave

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Lead a class discussion on the differences between the three weave structures
- Have students share their experiences with creating plain weave
- Review key vocabulary and concepts

## 9. Homework Assignment
- Complete the plain weave sample started in class (minimum 10cm x 10cm)
- Find and photograph three examples of different weave structures in everyday items at home or in the community
- Write a short paragraph comparing the characteristics of plain, twill, and satin weaves

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Warp: The vertical threads on a loom
- Weft: The horizontal threads woven through the warp
- Shed: The space created between raised and lowered warp threads
- Plain weave: A simple over-under weave structure
- Twill weave: A weave creating diagonal lines or patterns
- Satin weave: A weave with long floats creating a smooth surface
- Float: A portion of yarn that passes over multiple threads before interlacing
