# Resources for Learning Unit 2: Basic Weave Structures

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Plain Weave

#### Introduction
- Plain weave is the simplest and most common weave structure
- Also known as tabby weave or taffeta weave
- Characterized by a simple over-under pattern

#### Structure
- Weft thread goes over one warp thread, then under the next, alternating across the width
- Each row alternates, creating a checkerboard pattern
- Balanced plain weave has equal number and size of warp and weft threads

#### Characteristics
- Sturdy and durable
- Relatively flat surface
- Good drape when made with fine yarns
- Limited stretch, especially on the diagonal

#### Applications
- Everyday fabrics like muslin, cheesecloth, and canvas
- Base for many printed fabrics
- Used in traditional Timorese textiles for background areas

### Twill Weave

#### Introduction
- Characterized by diagonal lines on the fabric surface
- Weft threads pass over and under multiple warp threads in a repeated pattern

#### Structure
- Described by ratio of warp to weft floats (e.g., 2/1, 3/1)
- Offset each row to create diagonal effect
- Can be warp-faced, weft-faced, or balanced

#### Characteristics
- More pliable than plain weave
- Better drape and wrinkle resistance
- Can create interesting surface textures
- Stronger than plain weave due to more thread intersections

#### Variations
- Herringbone twill
- Diamond twill
- Broken twill

#### Applications
- Denim jeans (3/1 twill)
- Gabardine
- Some traditional Timorese textiles use twill variations for decorative elements

### Satin Weave

#### Introduction
- Characterized by long floats on the fabric surface
- Creates a smooth, lustrous appearance

#### Structure
- Weft threads float over multiple warp threads before interlacing
- Interlacing points distributed evenly to avoid visible pattern
- Typically requires at least 5 harnesses on the loom

#### Characteristics
- Smooth, shiny surface on one side
- Excellent drape
- Less durable than plain or twill weaves due to fewer intersections
- Can snag easily due to long floats

#### Variations
- Sateen (weft-faced satin)
- Damask (reversible satin-weave fabric)

#### Applications
- Luxurious fabrics like satin and charmeuse
- Neckties and linings
- Some ceremonial Timorese textiles incorporate satin weave for special effects

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How does the structure of plain weave contribute to its durability? Compare this to the properties of twill and satin weaves.

2. In what ways might the choice of weave structure affect the functionality and appearance of a traditional Timorese textile?

3. Consider the applications of each weave structure we've studied. How do the characteristics of each weave make it suitable for its common uses?

4. How might the choice of weave structure impact the production process and equipment needed for weaving?

5. Discuss the potential cultural significance of different weave structures in Timorese textiles. How might the choice of weave reflect the textile's purpose or meaning?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a short essay (300-500 words) comparing and contrasting two of the weave structures we've studied (plain, twill, or satin). Consider the following points:

- Structural differences
- Visual and tactile characteristics
- Suitable applications
- Potential cultural significance in Timorese textiles

Use specific examples to illustrate your points. Conclude by reflecting on how understanding these weave structures might inform your future weaving projects.

## 4. Assignment Details

### Weave Structure Analysis Project

#### Objective
Analyze and document examples of plain, twill, and satin weave structures in both everyday items and traditional Timorese textiles.

#### Instructions
1. Collect or photograph at least two examples each of plain, twill, and satin weave fabrics. Include both everyday items and traditional Timorese textiles if possible.

2. For each sample, provide the following information:
   - Type of weave structure
   - Source of the fabric (e.g., clothing item, household textile, traditional garment)
   - Fiber content (if known)
   - Visual and tactile characteristics
   - Suitability for its current use

3. Create a visual presentation (poster, digital slideshow, or fabric swatch book) showcasing your samples and analysis.

4. Write a 500-word reflection on what you've learned about how weave structures are used in both everyday and traditional contexts.

#### Submission
- Visual presentation of fabric samples and analysis
- Written reflection
- Due at the beginning of next week's class
