# Support Materials for Basic Weave Structures Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Warp**: The vertical threads on a loom that form the foundation of the fabric.
- **Weft**: The horizontal threads woven through the warp to create the fabric.
- **Shed**: The space created between raised and lowered warp threads, through which the weft is passed.
- **Plain weave**: A simple over-under weave structure where each weft thread passes alternately over and under each warp thread.
- **Twill weave**: A weave structure creating diagonal lines or patterns by passing weft threads over one or more warp threads, then under two or more warp threads, with a progressive offset.
- **Satin weave**: A weave structure with long floats creating a smooth surface, where weft threads pass over multiple warp threads before interlacing.
- **Float**: A portion of yarn that passes over multiple threads before interlacing.
- **Shuttle**: A tool used to carry and insert the weft yarn through the shed.
- **Pick-up stick**: A flat stick used to manually select and lift specific warp threads to create patterns.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Plain Weave Diagram**: A simple grid showing alternating over-under pattern of warp and weft threads.

2. **Twill Weave Diagram**: A grid showing diagonal lines created by offset interlacing of warp and weft threads.

3. **Satin Weave Diagram**: A grid showing long floats of weft threads over multiple warp threads.

4. **Loom Parts Diagram**: Labeled illustration of a basic frame loom, identifying key parts (warp beam, cloth beam, heddle, shed stick).

5. **Weave Structure Comparison**: Side-by-side images of plain, twill, and satin weave fabrics, highlighting their visual differences.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Weave Structure Identification Worksheet**: 
   - Images of various fabric samples
   - Space for students to identify the weave structure and describe its characteristics
   - Questions prompting analysis of how the structure affects fabric properties

2. **Plain Weave Practice Guide**:
   - Step-by-step instructions for warping a small frame loom
   - Diagram of proper weft insertion technique
   - Troubleshooting tips for common beginner issues

3. **Weave Structure Comparison Chart**:
   - Table with columns for plain, twill, and satin weaves
   - Rows for characteristics like appearance, durability, drape, common uses
   - Space for students to fill in information during the lesson

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "The Weaver's Companion" by Handwoven Magazine - Comprehensive guide to weave structures and drafting.

2. "Weaving: Contemporary Makers on the Loom" by Katie Treggiden - Explores modern applications of traditional weaving techniques.

3. Online resource: www.handweaving.net - Extensive database of weave drafts and patterns.

4. YouTube channel: "Weaving Secrets" - Video tutorials on various weaving techniques and structures.

5. Local resource: Contact information for Timorese Weavers Association for workshops and demonstrations.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling with consistent tension in plain weave.
   **Solution**: Demonstrate proper beater use and weft insertion technique. Encourage frequent checking and adjusting of edges.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty understanding float concept in satin weave.
   **Solution**: Use enlarged diagrams and hands-on demonstrations with thick yarn to make floats more visible.

3. **Challenge**: Confusion between similar-looking twill variations.
   **Solution**: Provide magnifying glasses for close examination of fabric samples. Create a twill variation chart for reference.

4. **Challenge**: Students rushing through weaving without proper planning.
   **Solution**: Implement a "design before weave" rule, requiring a simple draft before starting each project.

5. **Challenge**: Uneven selvedges in student work.
   **Solution**: Teach the "bubble" technique for weft insertion and provide individual guidance on maintaining consistent width.

6. **Challenge**: Limited number of looms for hands-on practice.
   **Solution**: Implement a rotation system and pair students for collaborative learning. Provide alternative activities like draft creation for students waiting for loom access.
