## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with tension on backstrap looms
   - Tip: Demonstrate proper body positioning and encourage frequent breaks. Pair struggling students with more experienced weavers.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in recognizing or reproducing traditional motifs
   - Tip: Provide simplified versions of motifs for beginners. Use tracing paper to help students practice motif shapes before weaving.

3. Challenge: Managing limited loom resources in larger classes
   - Tip: Implement a rotation system. While some students weave, others can practice drafting or yarn preparation.

4. Challenge: Maintaining student engagement during demonstrations
   - Tip: Use a document camera or pre-recorded close-up video to ensure all students can see detailed techniques. Incorporate frequent quick practice sessions.

5. Challenge: Addressing varying skill levels in the class
   - Tip: Prepare additional, more complex patterns for advanced students. Encourage peer teaching to reinforce learning and manage different paces.

6. Challenge: Ensuring cultural sensitivity when discussing traditional designs
   - Tip: Consult with local elders or master weavers before the lesson. Emphasize the importance of respecting and preserving traditional knowledge.
