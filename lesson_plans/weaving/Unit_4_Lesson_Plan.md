Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 4: Yarn and Fiber Properties, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Yarn and Fiber Properties

## 1. Resources Needed
- Samples of various natural and synthetic fibers (cotton, wool, silk, linen, polyester, nylon)
- Magnifying glasses or microscopes
- Yarn samples of different counts and twists
- Small warping board or pegs
- Bobbins and bobbin winder
- Handouts with fiber properties and yarn count information
- Burn test kit (for fiber identification)

## 2. Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify common natural and synthetic fibers used in weaving
- Understand basic yarn properties including count and twist
- Perform basic yarn preparation techniques such as winding warps and preparing bobbins

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- "Fiber Feel Challenge": Pass around bags containing different fiber samples without labels. Have students feel the fibers and guess what they might be based on texture and appearance.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)
Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Staple fiber
- Filament fiber
- Yarn count
- Twist direction (S-twist, Z-twist)
- Warp
- Bobbin

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)
- Overview of natural fibers (cotton, wool, silk, linen) and their properties
- Introduction to common synthetic fibers (polyester, nylon) and their characteristics
- Explanation of yarn count systems (e.g., Ne, Tex)
- Demonstration of yarn twist and its impact on fabric properties
- Introduction to warp winding and bobbin preparation techniques

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)
- Fiber identification exercise:
  * Provide students with unlabeled fiber samples
  * Guide them through visual, touch, and burn tests to identify fibers
  * Discuss results and key identifying characteristics

- Yarn count and twist analysis:
  * In small groups, have students examine different yarn samples
  * Estimate relative yarn counts and determine twist direction
  * Compare findings and discuss implications for fabric properties

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)
- Warp winding practice:
  * Demonstrate proper warp winding technique on a warping board
  * Have students practice winding a small warp (e.g., 1 meter long, 20 ends)

- Bobbin winding practice:
  * Show correct bobbin winding technique
  * Allow students to practice winding bobbins with different yarns

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Quick quiz: Show images or samples of fibers/yarns and have students identify key properties
- Group discussion: How might different fiber and yarn properties affect the final woven fabric?

## 9. Homework Assignment
- Create a fiber and yarn sample book:
  * Collect 5-10 different fiber or yarn samples
  * For each sample, identify the fiber content, estimate yarn count, and note twist direction
  * Include a brief description of potential uses in weaving

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Staple fiber: Short fibers that must be spun into yarn (e.g., cotton, wool)
- Filament fiber: Long, continuous fibers (e.g., silk, synthetic fibers)
- Yarn count: A numerical expression of yarn linear density
- Twist direction: The spiral direction of fiber alignment in a yarn (S-twist or Z-twist)
- Warp: The lengthwise yarns in a woven fabric
- Bobbin: A cylinder or spindle on which yarn is wound for use in weaving
