# Support Material for Yarn and Fiber Properties Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Staple fiber**: Short fibers that must be spun into yarn (e.g., cotton, wool)
- **Filament fiber**: Long, continuous fibers (e.g., silk, synthetic fibers)
- **Yarn count**: A numerical expression of yarn linear density
- **Twist direction**: The spiral direction of fiber alignment in a yarn (S-twist or Z-twist)
- **Warp**: The lengthwise yarns in a woven fabric
- **Weft**: The crosswise yarns in a woven fabric
- **Bobbin**: A cylinder or spindle on which yarn is wound for use in weaving
- **Denier**: A unit of measure for the linear mass density of fibers
- **Tex**: Another unit of measure for the linear mass density of fibers
- **Crimp**: The waviness of a fiber

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

   - Space for students to sketch fiber appearance under magnification

2. Yarn Analysis Worksheet:
   - Sections for recording yarn count estimates, twist direction, and fiber content guesses for 5-6 different yarn samples
   - Questions prompting students to consider how these properties might affect fabric characteristics

3. Warp Calculation Guide:
   - Step-by-step instructions for calculating warp length and number of ends needed for a small project
   - Practice problems for students to solve

4. Bobbin Winding Checklist:
   - List of steps for proper bobbin winding
   - Common mistakes to avoid
   - Space for students to note their observations during practice

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

   - Link to a comprehensive database of fiber types and their properties
   - Includes high-quality images and detailed descriptions

2. Yarn Count Conversion Calculator:
   - Web tool for converting between different yarn count systems (Ne, Tex, Denier)

3. Video Tutorials:
   - Links to video demonstrations of warp winding and bobbin preparation techniques

4. Recommended Books:
   - "Yarns and Fibres" by Debbie Tomkies
   - "The Weaver's Companion" by Handwoven Magazine

5. Local Fiber Resources:
   - List of Timor-Leste specific plant fibers and their properties
   - Information on where to source local fibers for projects

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Difficulty in fiber identification:
   - Provide a simplified identification key focusing on the most common fibers
   - Use exaggerated samples to highlight key differences before moving to more subtle distinctions

2. Confusion about yarn count systems:
   - Start with a hands-on demonstration using yarn samples of known counts
   - Use analogies to everyday objects to explain the concept of linear density

3. Struggles with warp winding:
   - Break down the process into smaller steps and have students practice each step separately
   - Use colored yarns to make the warp path more visible on the warping board

4. Uneven bobbin winding:
   - Demonstrate common mistakes and their consequences
   - Provide one-on-one guidance during practice sessions

5. Limited access to diverse fiber samples:
   - Create a class fiber library with contributions from students and local weavers
   - Use high-quality images and videos as supplements when physical samples are unavailable

6. Connecting theory to practical applications:
   - Regularly relate fiber and yarn properties to traditional Timorese textiles
   - Invite local weavers to share their experiences with different fibers and yarns
