Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 5: Designing Woven Textiles, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Designing Woven Textiles

## 1. Resources Needed

- Graph paper and pencils for each student
- Colored pencils or markers
- Sample weaving drafts and color wheels
- Digital projector (if available)
- Samples of traditional Timorese textiles
- Weaving draft software (optional)

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Create basic weaving drafts using standard notation
- Apply color theory principles to woven textile design
- Adapt traditional Timorese motifs for modern designs

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Display various Timorese textiles and ask students to identify patterns and color combinations they find appealing.
- Have students share their observations with a partner and discuss why certain designs stand out to them.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain the following terms:
- Weaving draft
- Warp threading
- Tie-up
- Treadling
- Color harmony
- Complementary colors
- Analogous colors

Use visual aids and examples to illustrate each concept.

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

### A. Weaving Notation and Drafting
- Explain the components of a weaving draft: threading, tie-up, and treadling.
- Demonstrate how to read and interpret a basic weaving draft.
- Show examples of how drafts translate to woven fabric.

### B. Color Theory for Woven Textiles
- Review basic color theory (primary, secondary, tertiary colors).
- Discuss color harmonies and their application in weaving.
- Explain how color interaction differs in woven textiles compared to other media.

### C. Adapting Traditional Motifs
- Showcase examples of traditional Timorese motifs.
- Discuss methods for simplifying or modernizing traditional designs.
- Demonstrate how to incorporate traditional elements into contemporary patterns.

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

### A. Drafting Exercise
- Provide students with a simple weave structure.
- Guide them through creating a complete weaving draft on graph paper.

### B. Color Palette Development
- Have students choose a traditional Timorese textile as inspiration.
- Ask them to create a modern color palette based on the chosen textile using colored pencils or markers.

## 7. Production Tasks (30 minutes)

- Students will combine their draft and color palette to design a small woven sample.
- They should create a full weaving draft with threading, tie-up, and treadling, along with a color key.

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Have students display their designs.
- Conduct a brief class critique, focusing on effective use of drafting techniques and color theory.
- Summarize key points about weaving drafts, color in weaving, and adapting traditional motifs.

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and select a traditional Timorese motif not covered in class.
- Create a modernized version of this motif, including a weaving draft and color scheme.
- Write a short paragraph explaining the choices made in adapting the motif.

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- **Weaving draft**: A visual representation of a weave structure, including threading, tie-up, and treadling.
- **Warp threading**: The order in which warp threads are passed through heddles.
- **Tie-up**: The connection between treadles and shafts on a loom.
- **Treadling**: The sequence of pressing treadles to create the woven pattern.
- **Color harmony**: Pleasing arrangements of colors based on their relationships on the color wheel.
- **Complementary colors**: Colors opposite each other on the color wheel.
- **Analogous colors**: Colors adjacent to each other on the color wheel.
