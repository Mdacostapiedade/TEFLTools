# Resources for Learning Unit 5: Designing Woven Textiles

## 1. Lecture Notes

### A. Weaving Notation and Drafting

#### Introduction to Weaving Drafts
- A weaving draft is a visual representation of how a woven fabric is constructed
- It consists of four main parts: threading, tie-up, treadling, and drawdown
- Drafts allow weavers to plan and communicate complex patterns

#### Components of a Weaving Draft
1. Threading:
   - Represents how warp threads are arranged on the loom
   - Read from right to left
   - Each column represents one warp thread
   - Numbers indicate which shaft the thread is threaded through

2. Tie-up:
   - Shows which shafts are connected to which treadles
   - Represented as a grid
   - Black squares indicate a connection between shaft and treadle

3. Treadling:
   - Indicates the order in which treadles are pressed
   - Read from top to bottom
   - Each row represents one pick (one pass of the weft)

4. Drawdown:
   - Visual representation of the final fabric structure
   - Black squares represent warp threads on top, white squares represent weft threads on top

#### Reading and Interpreting Drafts
- Start with the threading to understand warp arrangement
- Look at the tie-up to see how shafts and treadles are connected
- Follow the treadling to visualize how the pattern develops
- Use the drawdown to see the overall fabric structure

### B. Color Theory for Woven Textiles

#### Basic Color Theory Review
- Primary colors: Red, Blue, Yellow
- Secondary colors: Green, Orange, Purple
- Tertiary colors: Combinations of primary and secondary colors

#### Color Harmonies in Weaving
1. Complementary:
   - Colors opposite on the color wheel
   - Creates high contrast and vibrant designs
   - Example: Blue and Orange in traditional Timorese textiles

2. Analogous:
   - Colors adjacent on the color wheel
   - Creates harmonious, subtle designs
   - Example: Green, Blue-Green, and Blue in nature-inspired textiles

3. Triadic:
   - Three colors equally spaced on the color wheel
   - Balanced yet vibrant combinations
   - Example: Red, Yellow, and Blue in festive textiles

#### Color Interaction in Woven Textiles
- Optical mixing: Colors blend visually when woven in small patterns
- Warp and weft interaction: Different effects when colors cross
- Color dominance: Proportion of colors affects overall appearance

### C. Adapting Traditional Motifs

#### Overview of Traditional Timorese Motifs
- Geometric patterns: Diamonds, triangles, zigzags
- Symbolic motifs: Crocodiles, roosters, ancestral figures
- Regional variations: Distinct patterns from different districts

#### Methods for Modernizing Traditional Designs
1. Simplification:
   - Reduce complex motifs to basic shapes
   - Focus on key elements of the design

2. Scale adjustment:
   - Enlarge or reduce motif size for different effects
   - Combine large and small versions of the same motif

3. Color modification:
   - Use non-traditional color palettes
   - Apply color theory principles to traditional patterns

4. Pattern repetition:
   - Alter the frequency or arrangement of motifs
   - Create new rhythms with traditional elements

#### Incorporating Traditional Elements in Contemporary Patterns
- Use traditional motifs as borders or accents in modern designs
- Combine elements from different traditional patterns
- Integrate traditional symbols into abstract compositions

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How does understanding weaving drafts enhance a weaver's ability to create complex patterns?
2. In what ways does color interaction in woven textiles differ from other art forms like painting or printing?
3. What are the potential benefits and challenges of modernizing traditional Timorese motifs?
4. How can color theory be applied to create more appealing and marketable woven products?
5. Discuss the importance of preserving traditional weaving techniques while also innovating for contemporary markets.
6. How might digital tools and software change the process of designing woven textiles?

## 3. Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a short essay (300-500 words) on one of the following topics:

1. Analyze a traditional Timorese textile, describing its motifs, colors, and potential symbolic meanings. Then, propose a modern adaptation of this textile, explaining your design choices.

2. Compare and contrast the use of color in traditional Timorese textiles with contemporary Western textile design. Discuss how cultural differences might influence color preferences and symbolism.

3. Describe how understanding weaving drafts and color theory could benefit Timorese weavers in developing new products for both local and international markets.

## 4. Assignment Details

### Design Project: Modernizing a Traditional Motif

Objective: Create a contemporary woven design based on a traditional Timorese motif.

Steps:
1. Select a traditional Timorese motif from provided examples or personal research.
2. Analyze the motif's structure, symbolism, and typical color usage.
3. Develop a modernized version of the motif using techniques discussed in class.
4. Create a complete weaving draft for your design, including threading, tie-up, and treadling.
5. Develop a color palette for your design, explaining your choices based on color theory principles.
6. Prepare a short written explanation (200-300 words) of your design process and choices.

Deliverables:
- Original motif reference and analysis
- Modernized motif design (hand-drawn or digital)
- Complete weaving draft
- Color palette with explanation
- Written design process explanation

Due date: End of next week's class
