# Support Material for Designing Woven Textiles Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Weaving draft**: A visual representation of a weave structure, including threading, tie-up, and treadling.
- **Warp threading**: The order in which warp threads are passed through heddles.
- **Tie-up**: The connection between treadles and shafts on a loom.
- **Treadling**: The sequence of pressing treadles to create the woven pattern.
- **Color harmony**: Pleasing arrangements of colors based on their relationships on the color wheel.
- **Complementary colors**: Colors opposite each other on the color wheel.
- **Analogous colors**: Colors adjacent to each other on the color wheel.
- **Motif**: A decorative design or pattern used in textiles.
- **Warp**: The vertical threads on a loom.
- **Weft**: The horizontal threads woven through the warp.
- **Shuttle**: A tool used to carry the weft thread across the warp.

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. **Basic Weaving Draft Diagram**: A labeled diagram showing the components of a weaving draft (threading, tie-up, treadling, and drawdown).

2. **Color Wheel**: A standard color wheel highlighting primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, with examples of complementary and analogous color relationships.

3. **Traditional Timorese Motifs Chart**: A visual collection of common Timorese textile motifs with their names and symbolic meanings.

4. **Weave Structure Samples**: Small woven samples or clear diagrams of plain weave, twill, and satin structures.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. **Weaving Draft Practice Sheet**: A worksheet with blank graph paper for students to practice creating weaving drafts. Include a section for threading, tie-up, treadling, and drawdown.

2. **Color Harmony Exercise**: A worksheet where students can experiment with different color combinations based on the color wheel. Include spaces for complementary, analogous, and triadic color schemes.

3. **Motif Modernization Worksheet**: A template for students to sketch a traditional Timorese motif and then create a modernized version alongside it. Include space for notes on the changes made and reasoning behind them.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. "The Weaver's Companion" by Handwoven Magazine - A comprehensive guide to weaving drafts and structures.

2. "Color and Texture in Weaving: 150 Contemporary Designs" by Margo Selby - Inspiration for color use in woven textiles.

3. "Timor Textiles" by Joanna Barrkman - An in-depth look at traditional Timorese textile designs and techniques.

4. Online Weaving Draft Software: 
   - WeavePoint (www.weavepoint.com)
   - Pixeloom (www.pixeloom.com)

5. YouTube Channel: "Weaving Techniques with Jane Stafford" - For visual demonstrations of weaving techniques.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students struggling to understand weaving draft notation.
   **Solution**: Use physical demonstrations with a small loom to show how the draft translates to actual weaving. Provide step-by-step guidance in creating a simple draft.

2. **Challenge**: Difficulty in applying color theory to woven designs.
   **Solution**: Start with simple color exercises using colored paper or digital tools before moving to yarn. Encourage experimentation and discuss how colors interact differently in woven structures.

3. **Challenge**: Students feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of traditional motifs.
   **Solution**: Begin with very simple geometric motifs and gradually introduce more complex designs. Emphasize that adaptation can involve significant simplification.

4. **Challenge**: Limited access to traditional Timorese textiles for reference.
   **Solution**: Create a digital archive of high-quality images of traditional textiles. If possible, collaborate with local museums or artisans to arrange viewings of actual textiles.

5. **Challenge**: Balancing tradition with innovation in design exercises.
   **Solution**: Discuss the importance of cultural preservation while encouraging creativity. Provide examples of successful modern adaptations of traditional designs from various cultures.

6. **Challenge**: Students with varying levels of drawing skills for design work.
   **Solution**: Offer alternatives like collage or digital design tools. Emphasize that rough sketches are valuable in the design process and that precision will come with practice.
