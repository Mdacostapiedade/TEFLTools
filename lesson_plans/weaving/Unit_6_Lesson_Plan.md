## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Warp beam: The roller at the back of the loom that holds the warp threads
- Cloth beam: The roller at the front of the loom where the woven fabric is wound
- Heddles: Wire or cord with an eye in the center, used to raise and lower warp threads
- Treadles: Foot-operated levers that control the harnesses
- Shed: The opening created between raised and lowered warp threads
- Shuttle: The tool used to pass the weft thread through the shed
- Reed: A comb-like device that spaces the warp threads and beats the weft into place
