# Resources for Learning Unit 6: Introduction to Floor Looms

## 1. Lecture Notes

### Types of Floor Looms

#### Jack Looms
- Most common type of floor loom
- Each harness is lifted independently
- Treadles are tied directly to harnesses
- Pros: Versatile, easy to understand
- Cons: Can be tiring for complex weaves with many harnesses

#### Counterbalance Looms
- Harnesses are connected in pairs
- When one harness goes up, its partner goes down
- Good for balanced weaves (e.g., plain weave, twills)
- Pros: Creates a clean shed, less physical effort
- Cons: Limited to even number of harnesses, less versatile

#### Countermarch Looms
- Combines features of jack and counterbalance looms
- Can lift and lower any combination of harnesses
- Pros: Versatile, good for complex weaves
- Cons: More complicated to set up and adjust

### Parts of a Floor Loom

1. Warp Beam: Holds the warp threads
2. Cloth Beam: Holds the woven fabric
3. Heddles: Wire or cord with eyes to hold warp threads
4. Harnesses: Frames that hold heddles
5. Treadles: Foot pedals that control harnesses
6. Beater: Holds the reed and beats weft into place
7. Reed: Spaces warp threads and beats weft
8. Shuttle: Carries weft thread through shed
9. Breast Beam: Supports fabric as it's woven
10. Castle: Vertical frame that supports harnesses

### Basic Loom Operation

1. Creating the Shed:
   - Press treadle(s) to lift harnesses
   - This separates warp threads, creating an opening (shed)

2. Throwing the Shuttle:
   - Pass shuttle through shed from one side to the other
   - This lays the weft thread across the warp

3. Beating:
   - Use beater to push weft thread into place
   - This compacts the weave structure

4. Advancing the Warp:
   - Release brake on warp beam
   - Wind cloth beam to bring up fresh warp
   - Re-engage brake

### Warping Process Overview

1. Measuring the Warp:
   - Use warping board to measure threads to desired length
   - Create lease (cross) to maintain thread order

2. Threading Heddles:
   - Pass warp threads through heddle eyes according to pattern

3. Sleying the Reed:
   - Draw warp threads through reed dents to set width and density

4. Tying On:
   - Secure warp to cloth beam
   - Tension warp evenly across width

5. Tying Up Treadles:
   - Connect treadles to harnesses according to weave pattern

## 2. Discussion Questions

1. How do floor looms differ from backstrap looms in terms of capabilities and ease of use?
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each type of floor loom (jack, counterbalance, countermarch)?
3. How might the choice of loom type affect the types of textiles that can be produced?
4. In what ways could floor looms be integrated into traditional Timorese weaving practices?
5. How might the introduction of floor looms impact the economic potential of weaving in Timor-Leste?
6. What challenges might weavers face when transitioning from backstrap looms to floor looms?
7. How does the warping process for a floor loom compare to that of a backstrap loom?
8. What safety considerations should be kept in mind when working with floor looms?

## 3. Practical Exercise Instructions

### Loom Parts Identification Game

1. Prepare cards with names of loom parts and their functions.
2. Divide students into teams.
3. One student from each team approaches the loom.
4. Instructor calls out a part name or function.
5. Students race to point to the correct part on the loom.
6. Award points for correct identifications.
7. Rotate through team members until all parts are covered.

### Assisted Loom Dressing

1. Divide class into four groups.
2. Assign each group a step in the warping process:
   - Group A: Measuring the warp
   - Group B: Threading heddles
   - Group C: Sleying the reed
   - Group D: Tying on the warp
3. Instructor demonstrates each step to the respective group.
4. Groups perform their assigned tasks under supervision.
5. Rotate groups so each student experiences all steps.

## 4. Assignment Details

### Research Report

- Choose one type of floor loom (jack, counterbalance, or countermarch)
- Write a 500-word report covering:
  * Basic operation principles
  * Advantages and disadvantages
  * Typical applications in weaving
  * At least one example of a textile traditionally made on this loom type
- Include at least two references (books, articles, or reputable websites)

### Labeled Loom Diagram

- Create a detailed diagram of a floor loom
- Label at least 12 major parts
- Include a brief description of each part's function
- Can be hand-drawn or digital
- Must be neat and clearly labeled

## 6. Safety Guidelines

1. Always engage loom brake when not actively weaving
2. Keep fingers clear of moving parts, especially when beating
3. Use proper posture to avoid strain during extended weaving sessions
4. Ensure proper lighting to reduce eye strain
5. Keep work area clean and free of tripping hazards
6. Use caution when handling sharp tools (scissors, reed hooks)
7. Follow proper lifting techniques when moving loom components
