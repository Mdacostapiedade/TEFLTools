Here's the support material for the lesson plan on Introduction to Floor Looms, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Introduction to Floor Looms

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Warp beam**: The roller at the back of the loom that holds the warp threads
- **Cloth beam**: The roller at the front of the loom where the woven fabric is wound
- **Heddles**: Wire or cord with an eye in the center, used to raise and lower warp threads
- **Treadles**: Foot-operated levers that control the harnesses
- **Shed**: The opening created between raised and lowered warp threads
- **Shuttle**: The tool used to pass the weft thread through the shed
- **Reed**: A comb-like device that spaces the warp threads and beats the weft into place
- **Harnesses**: Frames that hold the heddles and can be raised or lowered
- **Jack loom**: A type of floor loom where the harnesses are lifted by jacks
- **Counterbalance loom**: A floor loom where harnesses are connected so that as some rise, others fall
- **Countermarch loom**: A floor loom where harnesses can be independently raised or lowered

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Floor Loom Diagram:
   - Create a labeled diagram of a floor loom, including all major parts:
     * Warp beam
     * Cloth beam
     * Heddles
     * Harnesses
     * Treadles
     * Reed
     * Breast beam
     * Back beam
     * Castle

2. Shed Formation Illustration:
   - Illustrate the process of shed formation:
     * Resting position of warp threads
     * Raised harness creating an upper shed
     * Lowered harness creating a lower shed
     * Combined to show the full shed opening

3. Weaving Motion Sequence:
   - Create a series of simple diagrams showing the basic weaving sequence:
     1. Open shed
     2. Pass shuttle through shed
     3. Beat weft into place with reed
     4. Change shed
     5. Repeat

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Loom Parts Identification Worksheet:
   - Provide an unlabeled diagram of a floor loom
   - List all major parts
   - Ask students to match the parts to their correct locations on the diagram

2. Weaving Troubleshooting Guide:
   - Create a table with common weaving issues and their solutions:
     * Uneven edges
     * Loose warp threads
     * Skipped threads
     * Uneven tension

3. Loom Dressing Checklist:
   - Provide a step-by-step checklist for dressing a loom:
     * Measuring the warp
     * Winding the warp onto the beam
     * Threading heddles
     * Sleying the reed
     * Tying on the warp
     * Adjusting tension

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Books:
   - "Learning to Weave" by Deborah Chandler
   - "The Weaver's Companion" by Handwoven Magazine

2. Online Resources:
   - Handweaving.net - for weave drafts and patterns
   - YouTube channel "Weaving with Ashford" for video tutorials

3. Local Resources:
   - Contact information for nearby weaving guilds or cooperatives
   - List of local suppliers for weaving equipment and materials

4. Practice Exercises:
   - Design a simple weaving draft for a 4-shaft loom
   - Calculate warp length and number of ends for a small project

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with loom terminology
   - Solution: Create a visual glossary with photos of each loom part, and use consistent terminology throughout the lesson

2. Challenge: Limited number of floor looms for hands-on practice
   - Solution: Rotate small groups through loom stations, providing alternative activities for waiting groups (e.g., drafting, yarn winding)

3. Challenge: Difficulty in visualizing 3D weave structures
   - Solution: Use physical models made from cardboard or 3D-printed parts to demonstrate harness movement and shed formation

4. Challenge: Varying skill levels among students
   - Solution: Prepare additional, more complex tasks for advanced students, and provide extra support or simplified activities for those who need it

5. Challenge: Time management during loom dressing demonstration
   - Solution: Pre-warp a loom partially before class, focusing the in-class demonstration on key steps. Provide a detailed handout for students to reference later

6. Challenge: Maintaining consistent tension during warping
   - Solution: Demonstrate proper tensioning techniques, and have students practice on smaller looms or warping boards before moving to floor looms
