Here's a detailed lesson plan for Learning Unit 7: Fabric Analysis and Finishing, formatted in Markdown:

# Lesson Plan: Fabric Analysis and Finishing

## 1. Resources Needed
- Various fabric samples (different weave structures, weights, and fibers)
- Magnifying glasses or loupes
- Fabric pick counters
- Digital scales
- Measuring tapes or rulers
- Washing machine and dryer (or basins for hand washing)
- Iron and ironing board
- Basic embellishment materials (beads, sequins, embroidery thread)
- Handouts on fabric analysis methods and finishing techniques

## 2. Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Analyze fabric structure using appropriate tools and methods
- Calculate fabric count, weight, and cover factor
- Understand and apply basic wet finishing processes
- Demonstrate simple fabric embellishment techniques

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)
- Fabric feel exercise: Pass around various fabric samples and have students describe the texture, weight, and drape using descriptive adjectives.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)
Introduce and explain key terms:
- Fabric count
- Cover factor
- Wet finishing
- Scouring
- Fulling
- Embellishment

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)
### Fabric Analysis
- Demonstrate how to use a pick counter and calculate fabric count
- Explain the concept of cover factor and its importance
- Show how to measure and calculate fabric weight

### Wet Finishing Processes
- Discuss the purposes of wet finishing (improving appearance, handle, and performance)
- Explain common wet finishing techniques: scouring, fulling, tentering

### Embellishment Techniques
- Introduce basic embellishment methods: beading, sequins, simple embroidery

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups and provide each with fabric samples
- Have groups analyze their samples, determining fabric count, weight, and estimating cover factor
- Demonstrate a simple wet finishing process (e.g., hand washing and pressing a sample)
- Guide students through a basic embellishment technique on a small fabric swatch

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)
- Students apply a wet finishing process to their own woven samples from previous lessons
- Students design and begin implementing a simple embellishment on their finished fabric

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)
- Class discussion on how finishing processes affected their fabrics
- Quick quiz on key concepts (fabric count, cover factor, wet finishing purposes)

## 9. Homework Assignment
- Complete the embellishment project started in class
- Write a short report comparing the properties of their fabric before and after finishing

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions
- Fabric count: The number of warp and weft yarns per inch or centimeter of fabric
- Cover factor: A measure of how well the yarns in a fabric cover its area
- Wet finishing: Processes applied to fabric using water or other liquids to alter its properties
- Scouring: Cleaning fabric to remove dirt, oils, and other impurities
- Fulling: A finishing process that involves controlled shrinkage to increase fabric density
- Embellishment: Decorative elements added to fabric to enhance its appearance
