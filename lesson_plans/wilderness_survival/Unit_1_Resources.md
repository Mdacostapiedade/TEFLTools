## Bushcraft Ethics and Leave No Trace Principles

### Leave No Trace Principles
1. Plan ahead and prepare
2. Travel and camp on durable surfaces
3. Dispose of waste properly
4. Leave what you find
5. Minimize campfire impacts
6. Respect wildlife
7. Be considerate of other visitors

### Application in Timor-Leste
- Respecting sacred sites and traditional lands
- Proper waste management in areas with limited facilities
- Sustainable harvesting of plants for bushcraft activities
- Minimizing impact on sensitive ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs, mangroves)

# Discussion Questions

# Assignment Details

## Traditional Timorese Wilderness Practice Research

1. Choose one traditional Timorese wilderness practice (e.g., a specific hunting technique, plant harvesting method, or navigation skill).

2. Research the practice using at least three sources. These can include:
   - Interviews with elders or community members
   - Books or articles on Timorese culture and traditions
   - Reputable websites focused on Timor-Leste's heritage

3. Write a one-page report (approximately 300-400 words) that includes:
   - A description of the practice
   - Its historical and cultural significance
   - How it relates to modern bushcraft skills
   - Any environmental or conservation considerations

4. Include a bibliography listing your sources.

## Local Species Identification List

1. Create a list of 10 local plant or animal species not covered in class.

2. For each species, provide:
   - Common name (in English and Tetum, if possible)
   - Scientific name
   - A brief description (2-3 sentences) including:
     * Physical characteristics
     * Habitat
     * Any notable uses or cultural significance

3. If possible, include a small sketch or photograph of each species.

4. Organize your list clearly, either alphabetically or by type of organism (e.g., plants, mammals, birds, etc.).

# Additional Materials

## Field Guide Excerpt: Sandalwood (Santalum album)

Sandalwood is a small tree native to Timor-Leste, growing up to 10 meters tall. It has a smooth, gray bark and opposite, oval leaves. The tree produces small, reddish flowers and round, fleshy fruits.

Habitat: Dry, well-drained soils in lowland areas and lower mountain slopes.

Cultural Significance: Highly valued for its aromatic wood, used in traditional medicine, religious ceremonies, and as a cash crop.

Conservation Status: Vulnerable due to overexploitation. Sustainable harvesting and cultivation efforts are ongoing in Timor-Leste.

Bushcraft Uses:
- Wood is excellent for carving small objects
- Leaves can be used for tea with medicinal properties
- Roots and bark have traditional medicinal uses (to be used sparingly and sustainably)

## Leave No Trace Principles Adapted for Timor-Leste

1. Plan Ahead and Prepare
   - Research local customs and sacred sites
   - Learn about sensitive ecosystems in your area
   - Prepare for tropical weather conditions

2. Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces
   - Stick to established trails when possible
   - In coastal areas, avoid damaging coral reefs or mangroves
   - Camp on sandy beaches above the high tide line

3. Dispose of Waste Properly
   - Pack out all trash, including organic waste when possible
   - Use biodegradable soap for washing, away from water sources
   - Learn proper human waste disposal for different ecosystems

4. Leave What You Find
   - Respect cultural artifacts and sacred objects
   - Take photos instead of collecting plants or shells
   - Be aware of protected species and their habitats

5. Minimize Campfire Impacts
   - Use established fire rings when available
   - In coastal areas, be mindful of sea turtle nesting sites
   - Collect only small, dead wood and burn it completely to ash

6. Respect Wildlife
   - Observe animals from a distance
   - Never feed wildlife, including marine life
   - Be aware of dangerous species (e.g., saltwater crocodiles)

7. Be Considerate of Other Visitors
   - Respect local communities and their land use
   - Keep noise levels down, especially near villages
   - Ask permission before photographing people or sacred sites
