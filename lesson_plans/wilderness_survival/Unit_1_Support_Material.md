## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Language Barriers:
   - Challenge: Students may have varying levels of language proficiency.
   - Solution: Use visual aids extensively and encourage peer translation.

2. Limited Access to Natural Areas:
   - Challenge: Difficulty in conducting nature walks or field trips.
   - Solution: Bring nature into the classroom with specimens, photos, and videos. Create a small nature area on school grounds if possible.

3. Cultural Sensitivities:
   - Challenge: Some traditional practices may conflict with modern conservation principles.
   - Solution: Approach topics with cultural sensitivity, emphasizing the value of both traditional knowledge and scientific understanding.

4. Lack of Prior Knowledge:
   - Challenge: Students may have limited exposure to formal ecological concepts.
   - Solution: Start with basic concepts and build gradually. Use local examples and traditional knowledge as a bridge to scientific concepts.

5. Limited Resources:
   - Challenge: Lack of field guides or equipment specific to Timor-Leste.
   - Solution: Create your own simple field guides using local knowledge and online resources. Improvise equipment using locally available materials.

6. Engaging All Students:
   - Challenge: Varying levels of interest in outdoor activities.
   - Solution: Incorporate a variety of activities including hands-on tasks, artistic projects, and storytelling to cater to different interests and learning styles.
