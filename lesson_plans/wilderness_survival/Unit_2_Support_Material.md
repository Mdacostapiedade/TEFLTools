## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have varying levels of outdoor experience.
   - **Solution**: Pair experienced students with novices for group activities.

2. **Challenge**: Limited access to some materials in the classroom setting.
   - **Solution**: Use simulations and role-play for certain activities. Bring in samples of materials when possible.

3. **Challenge**: Safety concerns during practical activities.
   - **Solution**: Establish clear safety guidelines. Demonstrate techniques before student practice. Have a first aid kit on hand.

4. **Challenge**: Difficulty in replicating real survival scenarios.
   - **Solution**: Use immersive storytelling and detailed scenarios to engage students' imaginations.

5. **Challenge**: Balancing traditional knowledge with modern techniques.
   - **Solution**: Invite local experts to share traditional methods. Discuss the pros and cons of different approaches.

6. **Challenge**: Time management during hands-on activities.
   - **Solution**: Set clear time limits for each activity. Use a timer and give periodic time updates.

7. **Challenge**: Addressing student anxiety about survival situations.
   - **Solution**: Emphasize that knowledge and preparation reduce risks. Focus on building confidence through skill mastery.
