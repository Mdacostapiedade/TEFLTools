# Lesson Plan: Navigation and Wayfinding in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Topographic maps of local area
- Compasses (1 per 2-3 students)
- Printouts of Southern Hemisphere star charts
- Flashlights for night sky observation
- Natural materials for creating sun compasses (flat rocks, sticks)
- Orienteering flags and punch cards
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on natural navigation techniques

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Read a topographic map and use a compass to navigate
- Identify the Southern Cross and use it for celestial navigation
- Recognize and interpret natural indicators for direction
- Complete a basic orienteering course using map and compass skills

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into pairs
- Give each pair a simple map of the classroom or nearby area
- Hide several objects around the space
- Have pairs use the map to locate the hidden objects
- Discuss strategies used to navigate the space

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (15 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Topographic map
- Contour lines
- Magnetic north vs. true north
- Declination
- Bearing
- Celestial navigation
- Southern Cross
- Natural indicators

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (45 minutes)

### Map and Compass Skills (25 minutes)
- Explain features of topographic maps
- Demonstrate how to use a compass
- Show how to take a bearing and follow it
- Explain map-to-terrain and terrain-to-map orientation

### Celestial Navigation (10 minutes)
- Introduce the Southern Cross constellation
- Explain how to find south using the Southern Cross
- Discuss limitations of celestial navigation (cloud cover, time of year)

### Natural Navigation Indicators (10 minutes)
- Present local natural indicators for direction:
  - Sun's position and movement
  - Prevailing wind patterns in Timor-Leste
  - Tree growth patterns
  - Moss growth on rocks and trees

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

### Activity 1: Map and Compass Exercise (30 minutes)
- In small groups, have students practice:
  - Taking bearings to landmarks
  - Plotting courses on maps
  - Following bearings in the field

### Activity 2: Creating a Sun Compass (15 minutes)
- Demonstrate how to create a simple sun compass using a stick and stones
- Have students create their own and practice using them

### Activity 3: Natural Indicators Scavenger Hunt (15 minutes)
- Send students to find examples of natural direction indicators
- Have them document findings with photos or sketches

## 7. Production Task (90 minutes)

### Orienteering Challenge
- Set up a short orienteering course on campus or nearby area
- Provide students with maps, compasses, and punch cards
- Have them navigate the course in pairs, finding control points
- Time the activity and discuss strategies upon completion

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (20 minutes)

- Debrief the orienteering activity
- Review key points of map reading, compass use, and natural navigation
- Address any questions or difficulties encountered
- Highlight the importance of multiple navigation methods

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Create a detailed map of the route from home to school, including:
  - Landmarks
  - Compass directions
  - Natural navigation indicators
- Research and write a short report on traditional Timorese navigation techniques

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- **Topographic map**: A detailed map showing natural and man-made features and elevation changes
- **Contour lines**: Lines on a map connecting points of equal elevation
- **Magnetic north**: The direction a compass needle points
- **True north**: The direction to the Earth's geographic North Pole
- **Declination**: The angular difference between magnetic north and true north
- **Bearing**: The direction from one point to another, usually expressed in degrees
- **Celestial navigation**: Using celestial bodies (stars, planets) for navigation
- **Southern Cross**: A constellation visible in the Southern Hemisphere, used for navigation
- **Natural indicators**: Environmental features that can be used to determine direction
