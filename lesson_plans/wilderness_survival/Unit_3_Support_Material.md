# Support Material for Navigation and Wayfinding in Timor-Leste

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Topographic map**: A detailed map showing natural and man-made features and elevation changes
- **Contour lines**: Lines on a map connecting points of equal elevation
- **Magnetic north**: The direction a compass needle points
- **True north**: The direction to the Earth's geographic North Pole
- **Declination**: The angular difference between magnetic north and true north
- **Bearing**: The direction from one point to another, usually expressed in degrees
- **Celestial navigation**: Using celestial bodies (stars, planets) for navigation
- **Southern Cross**: A constellation visible in the Southern Hemisphere, used for navigation
- **Natural indicators**: Environmental features that can be used to determine direction
- **Orienteering**: A sport that involves navigating between control points using a map and compass

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams

1. Topographic Map Features Diagram
   - Description: A labeled diagram showing key features of a topographic map, including contour lines, symbols for vegetation, water bodies, and man-made structures.

2. Compass Parts Illustration
   - Description: A labeled illustration of a compass, identifying key parts such as the magnetic needle, direction of travel arrow, rotating bezel, and declination adjustment.

3. Southern Cross Star Chart
   - Description: A star chart showing the Southern Cross constellation and nearby stars, with instructions on how to use it to find south.

4. Natural Navigation Indicators Infographic
   - Description: An infographic depicting various natural indicators for direction in Timor-Leste, such as sun position, prevailing winds, tree growth patterns, and moss on rocks.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets

1. Map Symbol Identification Worksheet
   - Content: A list of common topographic map symbols with blank spaces for students to write their meanings.

2. Bearing Calculation Practice Sheet
   - Content: A series of exercises where students calculate bearings between different points on a sample map.

3. Celestial Navigation Quick Reference Guide
   - Content: Step-by-step instructions for finding south using the Southern Cross, including a simple diagram.

4. Natural Navigation Scavenger Hunt Checklist
   - Content: A list of natural navigation indicators for students to find and document during the scavenger hunt activity.

## 4. Additional Resources for Further Reading or Practice

1. Online Orienteering Courses
   - Website links to virtual orienteering courses for additional practice

2. "Natural Navigation in the Southern Hemisphere" by Tristan Gooley
   - Book recommendation for in-depth study of natural navigation techniques

3. Timor-Leste Topographic Map Collection
   - Link to a digital repository of topographic maps for various regions in Timor-Leste

4. Smartphone Apps for Navigation Practice
   - List of recommended apps for compass use and star identification

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Challenge: Students struggling with compass use
   - Tip: Pair students and use peer teaching. Provide extra practice sessions with one-on-one guidance.

2. Challenge: Difficulty in visualizing contour lines
   - Tip: Use 3D models or augmented reality apps to demonstrate how contour lines represent terrain.

3. Challenge: Limited visibility for celestial navigation practice
   - Tip: Use planetarium software or apps to simulate night sky conditions. Schedule an optional evening session for real-sky observation.

4. Challenge: Varying levels of physical fitness for orienteering activity
   - Tip: Design courses with multiple difficulty levels. Allow students to choose their level or work in mixed-ability teams.

5. Challenge: Integrating traditional Timorese navigation knowledge
   - Tip: Invite local experts or elders to share traditional techniques. Encourage students to interview family members about traditional methods.
