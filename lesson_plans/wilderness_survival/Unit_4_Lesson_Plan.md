# Lesson Plan: Fire Craft in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Flint and steel sets
- Ferro rods
- Magnifying glasses
- Bamboo fire saws
- Dry tinder materials (e.g., coconut husk fibers, dried grass)
- Kindling and firewood
- Matches and lighters (for demonstration and backup)
- Fire extinguisher and water buckets for safety
- Local plant materials traditionally used for fire-starting
- Diagrams of different fire lays

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Demonstrate at least two traditional Timorese fire-starting techniques
- Successfully start a fire using modern fire-starting tools
- Explain the principles of fire management and safety
- Construct and maintain at least two different types of fires for specific purposes

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Group discussion: Students share their experiences with fire-starting and any traditional methods they know from their families or communities.

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Tinder
- Kindling
- Fuel
- Friction fire
- Ember
- Fire lay

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Traditional Timorese fire-starting techniques
   - Demonstrate bamboo fire saw method
   - Explain the use of local plant materials for tinder

2. Modern fire-starting tools
   - Demonstrate use of flint and steel, ferro rod, and magnifying glass

3. Fire types for different purposes
   - Explain and show diagrams of teepee fire, log cabin fire, and long fire

4. Fire management and safety
   - Discuss proper fire site selection
   - Explain methods for controlling and extinguishing fires

## 6. Practice Activities (60 minutes)

1. Divide students into small groups to practice:
   - Bamboo fire saw technique
   - Flint and steel fire-starting
   - Ferro rod use
   - Building different fire lays

2. Rotate groups through stations to ensure all students practice each technique

## 7. Production Tasks (45 minutes)

1. Fire-starting challenge:
   - Each student must start a fire using a traditional method and a modern method
   - Students maintain their fires and demonstrate proper safety techniques

2. Fire type construction:
   - Groups build and light different types of fires for specific purposes (e.g., cooking, signaling, warmth)

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Group discussion on challenges faced and techniques found most effective
- Quick quiz on fire safety principles
- Review of key learning points

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a short report on a traditional fire-starting method from another culture
- Practice a chosen fire-starting technique and log attempts in a journal

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Tinder: Easily combustible material used to start a fire
- Kindling: Small twigs or sticks used to build up a fire from the initial flame
- Fuel: Larger pieces of wood that sustain a fire
- Friction fire: A method of starting fire by creating heat through friction between two pieces of wood
- Ember: A small, glowing piece of coal or wood in a dying fire
- Fire lay: The arrangement of tinder, kindling, and fuel to start and maintain a fire
