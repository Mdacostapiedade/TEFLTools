## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Safety Concerns:
   - Ensure a proper fire safety briefing before any practical activities
   - Have fire extinguishers and water buckets readily available
   - Designate a "safety zone" and establish clear rules for fire handling

2. Varying Skill Levels:
   - Pair more experienced students with beginners for peer learning
   - Provide extra guidance and simplified tasks for struggling students
   - Offer advanced challenges for quick learners (e.g., timed fire-starting)

3. Limited Resources:
   - Encourage resource sharing and rotation among student groups
   - Demonstrate alternative techniques using readily available materials
   - Involve the local community in providing traditional fire-starting materials

4. Weather Challenges:
   - Have a covered area available for fire practice in case of rain
   - Teach and practice wet-weather fire-starting techniques
   - Store tinder and kindling in waterproof containers

5. Cultural Sensitivity:
   - Research and respect any local taboos or customs related to fire
   - Invite local elders to share traditional fire-making wisdom
   - Emphasize the cultural significance of fire in Timorese traditions

6. Environmental Concerns:
   - Stress Leave No Trace principles throughout the lesson
   - Teach proper fire site selection to minimize environmental impact
   - Demonstrate thorough fire extinguishing and site restoration techniques
