# Lesson Plan: Water Sourcing and Purification in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Local maps showing water sources
- Water testing kits
- Various water purification methods (filters, chemical treatments, etc.)
- Natural materials for constructing filters (sand, gravel, charcoal, cloth)
- Containers for water collection and storage
- Firewood and matches/firestarter for boiling demonstration
- Handouts on local water sources and purification methods

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify safe water sources in Timor-Leste's environment
- Demonstrate at least three different water purification methods
- Construct a basic water filter using natural materials
- Explain the importance of water safety in wilderness survival

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Group discussion: Ask students to share their experiences with finding and purifying water in the wilderness
- Quick quiz: Show images of different water sources and have students vote on which they think are safe to drink from directly

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- Potable water
- Contamination
- Filtration
- Purification
- Pathogens
- Turbidity

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- Overview of local water sources in Timor-Leste (rivers, springs, coastal areas)
- Potential contaminants and health risks associated with untreated water
- Water collection techniques and best practices
- Detailed explanation of purification methods:
  - Boiling
  - Filtration (commercial and improvised)
  - Chemical treatment (iodine, chlorine)
  - Solar disinfection (SODIS)
- Advantages and limitations of each method

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

- Water source identification exercise using local maps
- Demonstration of various purification methods
- Hands-on practice with chemical treatments and commercial filters

## 7. Production Tasks (60 minutes)

- In small groups, students construct water filters using natural materials
- Each group collects water from a nearby source (if available) or uses prepared "dirty" water
- Groups purify their water samples using their constructed filters and at least one other method

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Groups present their filters and purified water samples
- Class discussion on the effectiveness of different methods
- Review of key points and addressing any remaining questions

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a short report on a waterborne illness common in Timor-Leste and how proper water purification can prevent it
- Design an infographic explaining a water purification method for community education

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- Potable water: Water that is safe to drink
- Contamination: The presence of unwanted substances in water that make it unsafe
- Filtration: The process of removing impurities from water by passing it through a medium
- Purification: The process of removing contaminants from water to make it safe for consumption
- Pathogens: Microorganisms that can cause disease
- Turbidity: The cloudiness or haziness of water due to suspended particles
