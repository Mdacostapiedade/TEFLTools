# Lecture Notes

## Local Water Sources in Timor-Leste

### Rivers
- Major rivers: Loes, Laclo, Seical, Tafara
- Seasonal variations in water flow
- Potential contaminants: sediment, agricultural runoff, human/animal waste

### Springs
- Common in mountainous regions
- Often cleaner than surface water, but still require treatment
- Cultural significance of some springs in Timorese tradition

### Coastal Areas
- Brackish water near river mouths
- Saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers
- Desalination techniques for emergency situations

## Water Collection Techniques

### Surface Water Collection
- Use of natural depressions or dug seepage basins
- Improvised scoops from large leaves or bamboo
- Importance of collecting from flowing water when possible

### Rainwater Harvesting
- Traditional methods using palm leaves or thatched roofs
- Modern techniques with gutters and storage tanks
- Considerations for first flush diversion

### Groundwater Extraction
- Hand-dug wells and their maintenance
- Simple pump mechanisms (e.g., rope pumps)
- Identifying signs of groundwater presence in dry environments

## Water Purification Methods

### Boiling
- Bring water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute (3 minutes at higher altitudes)
- Advantages: Kills most pathogens, simple method
- Disadvantages: Fuel consumption, doesn't remove chemical contaminants

### Filtration
- Commercial filters: ceramic, activated carbon, reverse osmosis
- Improvised filters: sand, gravel, charcoal, cloth
- Maintenance and limitations of each filter type

### Chemical Treatment
- Iodine tablets: dosage, contact time, limitations
- Chlorine: liquid bleach, tablets, proper concentration
- Advantages and disadvantages of chemical treatments

### Solar Disinfection (SODIS)
- Process: fill clear plastic bottles, expose to sunlight for 6+ hours
- Effectiveness and limitations
- Combining SODIS with other methods for improved results

# Discussion Questions

1. How do seasonal changes affect water availability and quality in Timor-Leste?
2. What are the potential health risks associated with drinking untreated water in this region?
3. How can traditional Timorese knowledge about water sources be integrated with modern purification techniques?
4. What are the environmental impacts of different water collection and purification methods?
5. How might climate change affect water sources and purification needs in Timor-Leste?
6. What cultural considerations should be taken into account when introducing new water purification methods to local communities?
7. How can we balance the need for immediate water access in survival situations with long-term sustainability concerns?
8. What are the pros and cons of relying on chemical treatments for water purification in wilderness settings?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Water Source Analysis

1. Choose a specific location in Timor-Leste (e.g., a village, mountain area, or coastal region).
2. Research and describe the available water sources in that area.
3. Analyze the potential risks and benefits of each water source.
4. Propose a sustainable water collection and purification plan for that location.
5. Consider both short-term survival scenarios and long-term community use.
6. Your analysis should be 500-750 words and include at least three references.

# Assignment Details

## Water Purification Demonstration

1. In groups of 3-4, prepare a 15-minute demonstration of a water purification method.
2. Choose from: boiling, improvised filtration, chemical treatment, or SODIS.
3. Create visual aids (posters, diagrams, or digital presentations) to support your demonstration.
4. Include information on:
   - Step-by-step process
   - Materials needed
   - Effectiveness against different contaminants
   - Advantages and limitations
   - Relevance to Timor-Leste's environment
5. Be prepared to answer questions from the class after your demonstration.

# Additional Materials

## Water Quality Testing Procedure

1. Collect water samples from different sources (if available) or use prepared samples.
2. Use water testing kits to check for:
   - pH levels
   - Turbidity
   - Presence of coliform bacteria
   - Chlorine levels (for treated water)
3. Record results and compare to safe drinking water standards.
4. Discuss implications of test results for water treatment needs.

## Infographic: Common Waterborne Illnesses in Timor-Leste

[Create an infographic displaying:
- Names and images of common waterborne pathogens
- Symptoms of related illnesses
- Transmission routes
- Prevention methods focusing on water purification
- Statistics on prevalence in Timor-Leste]

## Case Study: Improving Water Access in Remote Timorese Villages

[Provide a 1-2 page case study describing a real or hypothetical project to improve water access and quality in a remote area of Timor-Leste. Include challenges faced, solutions implemented, and outcomes. Use this as a basis for class discussion on practical applications of water sourcing and purification techniques.]
