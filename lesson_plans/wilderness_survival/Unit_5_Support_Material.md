Here's the support material for the lesson on Water Sourcing and Purification in Timor-Leste, formatted in Markdown:

# Support Material for Water Sourcing and Purification Lesson

## 1. Key Vocabulary List with Definitions

- **Potable water**: Water that is safe to drink without risk of health problems
- **Contamination**: The presence of unwanted substances in water that make it unsafe for consumption
- **Filtration**: The process of removing impurities from water by passing it through a medium like sand, gravel, or charcoal
- **Purification**: The process of removing contaminants from water to make it safe for consumption
- **Pathogens**: Microorganisms that can cause disease, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites
- **Turbidity**: The cloudiness or haziness of water due to suspended particles
- **SODIS**: Solar water disinfection, a method of purifying water using sunlight and plastic bottles
- **Sedimentation**: The process of allowing suspended particles in water to settle at the bottom of a container
- **Chlorination**: The addition of chlorine to water for disinfection purposes
- **Iodine treatment**: The use of iodine tablets or solution to purify water

## 2. Visual Aids or Diagrams (described in text)

1. **Water Source Safety Diagram**: A visual representation of different water sources (river, spring, stagnant pond, rainwater collection) with color-coded indicators (green for safe, yellow for caution, red for unsafe) to show relative safety levels.

2. **Water Purification Methods Flowchart**: A flowchart showing different purification methods (boiling, filtration, chemical treatment, SODIS) with brief descriptions and icons representing each method.

3. **DIY Water Filter Diagram**: A cross-section diagram of a homemade water filter using a plastic bottle, showing layers of cloth, sand, gravel, and charcoal, with arrows indicating water flow.

4. **Water-borne Illness Infographic**: A visual representation of common water-borne illnesses in Timor-Leste, their symptoms, and how proper water purification can prevent them.

## 3. Handouts or Worksheets (content described)

1. **Water Source Identification Worksheet**: A map of a local area with various water sources marked. Students identify each source type and rate its potential safety.

2. **Water Purification Methods Comparison Chart**: A table listing different purification methods, their effectiveness against various contaminants, required resources, and time needed.

3. **DIY Water Filter Construction Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for building a simple water filter using locally available materials, with a materials list and safety precautions.

4. **Water Safety Scenario Cards**: A set of cards describing different water-related scenarios. Students must decide the best course of action for each situation.

## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Limited access to commercial water purification equipment.
   **Solution**: Focus on locally available materials and traditional methods. Demonstrate improvised techniques using common household items.

2. **Challenge**: Students may have preconceived notions about water safety.
   **Solution**: Begin with a myth-busting activity to address common misconceptions. Use local examples and statistics to reinforce accurate information.

3. **Challenge**: Difficulty in finding safe water sources for practical exercises.
   **Solution**: Prepare "dirty" water samples in advance using safe additives like soil or food coloring. Ensure all water used in class is actually safe.

4. **Challenge**: Varying literacy levels among students.
   **Solution**: Use visual aids and hands-on activities to convey key concepts. Pair stronger readers with those who need support for text-based activities.

5. **Challenge**: Cultural beliefs about water and traditional purification methods.
   **Solution**: Incorporate traditional knowledge into the lesson. Invite a local elder or expert to share cultural perspectives on water use and purification.

6. **Challenge**: Ensuring long-term retention of water safety practices.
   **Solution**: Assign practical homework tasks, such as creating a family water safety plan. Encourage students to teach family members what they've learned.
