# Lesson Plan: Shelter Building in Timor-Leste

## 1. Resources Needed

- Local vegetation samples (palm fronds, bamboo, etc.)
- Rope or cordage
- Tarps (for demonstration purposes)
- Machetes or large knives (under instructor supervision)
- First aid kit
- Diagrams of traditional Timorese shelters
- Photos of various shelter types

## 2. Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify suitable locations for shelter construction in Timor-Leste's environment
- Construct a basic shelter using local materials
- Explain the key principles of shelter design for tropical climates
- Demonstrate knowledge of traditional Timorese shelter techniques

## 3. Warm-up Activity (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Give each group a scenario (e.g., "You're caught in a sudden rainstorm in the mountains")
- Have groups brainstorm and sketch a quick shelter design for their scenario
- Share ideas with the class

## 4. Pre-teaching Key Vocabulary (10 minutes)

Introduce and explain key terms:
- A-frame shelter
- Lean-to
- Debris hut
- Thatching
- Lashing
- Ridgepole
- Ventilation
- Waterproofing

## 5. Presentation of Main Lesson Content (30 minutes)

1. Shelter Site Selection
   - High ground to avoid flooding
   - Natural windbreaks
   - Proximity to resources (water, materials)
   - Safety considerations (falling branches, animal paths)

2. Traditional Timorese Shelter Designs
   - Uma Lulik (sacred house) principles
   - Coastal vs. mountain shelter differences
   - Use of local materials (palm, bamboo, grass)

3. Modern Bushcraft Shelter Techniques
   - A-frame and lean-to designs
   - Debris hut for emergency situations
   - Tarp configurations

4. Adapting Shelters for Tropical Climates
   - Importance of ventilation
   - Raised floors to avoid moisture and insects
   - Steep roofs for heavy rainfall
   - Sun protection considerations

## 6. Practice Activities (45 minutes)

1. Material Identification Exercise
   - Students identify and collect suitable shelter-building materials from the local area

2. Knot-Tying Practice
   - Practice essential knots for shelter construction (e.g., clove hitch, square lashing)

3. Mini-Shelter Challenge
   - In pairs, students construct a small-scale shelter model using collected materials

## 7. Production Task (60 minutes)

Group Shelter Building Project:
- Divide class into teams of 4-5 students
- Each team constructs a full-size shelter using local materials
- Incorporate both traditional Timorese and modern bushcraft techniques
- Ensure shelters are adapted for the local climate

## 8. Wrap-up and Review (15 minutes)

- Teams present their shelters, explaining design choices
- Class discussion on strengths and potential improvements of each shelter
- Review key principles of tropical shelter construction

## 9. Homework Assignment

- Research and write a short report on a traditional shelter design from another tropical country
- Compare and contrast with Timorese designs
- Sketch an improved shelter design incorporating learned techniques

## 10. Key Vocabulary Definitions

- A-frame shelter: A triangular shelter formed by two supports leaning together
- Lean-to: A shelter with a single sloping roof, often against a tree or rock
- Debris hut: An emergency shelter made from forest debris piled over a frame
- Thatching: Covering a roof with plant materials to make it waterproof
- Lashing: Tying poles or sticks together with rope or natural cordage
- Ridgepole: The highest horizontal beam in a roof structure
- Ventilation: The provision of fresh air to a shelter
- Waterproofing: Making a shelter resistant to water penetration
