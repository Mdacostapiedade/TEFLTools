# Lecture Notes

## Shelter Site Selection

### Key Principles
- Choose high ground to avoid flooding and water accumulation
- Look for natural windbreaks (hills, large rocks, dense vegetation)
- Ensure proximity to essential resources (water, building materials)
- Consider safety factors (avoid areas with dead trees or loose rocks)

### Specific Considerations for Timor-Leste
- Coastal areas: Be aware of tidal patterns and storm surge risks
- Mountain regions: Account for sudden weather changes and potential landslides
- Forests: Look for clearings to reduce risk from falling branches

## Traditional Timorese Shelter Designs

### Uma Lulik (Sacred House) Principles
- Symbolic structure representing cosmic order
- Elevated design with strong central posts
- Use of local, sacred materials (specific wood types, palm fibers)

### Coastal vs. Mountain Shelter Differences
- Coastal: 
  - More open design for ventilation
  - Use of coconut palms and other salt-tolerant materials
  - Often built on stilts to protect from flooding
- Mountain:
  - Sturdier construction to withstand stronger winds
  - Steeper roofs for heavy rainfall
  - Use of bamboo and hardwoods common in higher elevations

### Use of Local Materials
- Palm fronds for thatching
- Bamboo for framework and flooring
- Grass and reeds for additional insulation and waterproofing

## Modern Bushcraft Shelter Techniques

### A-frame Design
- Simple, quick to construct
- Provides good rain runoff and wind protection
- Can be scaled for individual or group use

### Lean-to Design
- Versatile and easy to build
- Offers good protection from wind and rain from one direction
- Can be expanded or connected for larger groups

### Debris Hut for Emergency Situations
- Utilizes natural materials found on forest floor
- Provides insulation through layering of debris
- Small entrance for heat conservation

### Tarp Configurations
- Versatile for various weather conditions
- Quick to set up and take down
- Can be combined with natural materials for enhanced protection

## Adapting Shelters for Tropical Climates

### Ventilation Strategies
- Incorporate openings at both low and high points of the shelter
- Use breathable materials when possible
- Design for cross-ventilation to reduce humidity

### Raised Floor Construction
- Elevates sleeping area above damp ground
- Reduces exposure to insects and small animals
- Improves air circulation beneath the shelter

### Roof Design for Heavy Rainfall
- Steep pitch (at least 45 degrees) for quick water runoff
- Extended eaves to keep rain away from walls and floor
- Use of overlapping materials (palm fronds, leaves) for effective waterproofing

### Sun Protection Considerations
- Orient shelter to minimize direct sunlight exposure
- Use natural shade from trees or terrain features
- Incorporate removable sun screens or awnings for adaptability

# Discussion Questions

1. How do traditional Timorese shelter designs reflect the cultural and environmental context of the region?

2. What are the key differences between coastal and mountain shelter designs in Timor-Leste, and why do these differences exist?

3. How can modern bushcraft techniques be integrated with traditional Timorese methods to create more effective shelters?

4. Discuss the importance of proper site selection for shelter building. What factors are most critical in Timor-Leste's varied terrain?

5. How does the tropical climate of Timor-Leste influence shelter design, and what specific features are essential for comfort and safety?

6. Compare and contrast the benefits of natural materials versus modern tarps for shelter construction in a bushcraft context.

7. What role does ventilation play in tropical shelter design, and how can it be effectively incorporated?

8. Discuss the ethical considerations of harvesting natural materials for shelter building. How can we balance survival needs with environmental conservation?

9. How might climate change impact shelter design and construction techniques in Timor-Leste in the coming years?

10. In what ways can traditional shelter-building knowledge contribute to modern sustainable architecture practices?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Exercise: Shelter Design Proposal

1. Choose a specific location in Timor-Leste (e.g., a coastal area, mountain region, or forest setting).

2. Write a 500-word proposal for a shelter design that incorporates both traditional Timorese elements and modern bushcraft techniques.

3. Your proposal should include:
   - A description of the chosen location and its environmental characteristics
   - The materials you plan to use and why
   - Key design features and their purposes
   - How the shelter addresses climate-specific challenges
   - Any cultural or traditional elements incorporated into the design

4. Include a simple sketch or diagram of your shelter design.

5. Conclude with a brief explanation of how your design balances practicality, cultural sensitivity, and environmental sustainability.

# Assignment Details

## Individual Emergency Shelter Construction

### Objective
Demonstrate the ability to construct a functional emergency shelter using only natural materials found in the local environment.

### Requirements
1. The shelter must be built within a 2-hour time limit.
2. Only materials found within a 50-meter radius of your assigned spot may be used.
3. The shelter must be able to accommodate one person comfortably.
4. It should provide adequate protection from sun, wind, and potential rain.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Structural integrity and stability
- Effective use of available materials
- Adaptation to local environmental conditions
- Incorporation of learned techniques (both traditional and modern)
- Creativity in problem-solving

### Safety Considerations
- Wear appropriate protective gear (gloves, closed-toe shoes)
- Be aware of potential hazards (sharp materials, unstable structures)
- Work in pairs or small groups for safety, but construct individual shelters

### Reflection
After completing the shelter, write a short reflection (200-300 words) addressing:
- Challenges faced during construction
- Solutions devised for any unexpected problems
- How you applied knowledge from both traditional and modern techniques
- What you would do differently if you were to build the shelter again
