## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. Safety Concerns:
   - Challenge: Students mishandling tools like machetes
   - Solution: Provide thorough safety briefing, demonstrate proper techniques, and maintain close supervision

2. Limited Materials:
   - Challenge: Insufficient natural materials for all students to build full-size shelters
   - Solution: Organize students into larger groups or focus on building scaled-down models

3. Cultural Sensitivity:
   - Challenge: Misrepresentation of traditional Timorese techniques
   - Solution: Collaborate with local elders or cultural experts to ensure accurate information

4. Time Management:
   - Challenge: Shelter building taking longer than anticipated
   - Solution: Have pre-cut materials available and consider extending the lesson over multiple sessions

5. Varying Skill Levels:
   - Challenge: Students progressing at different rates
   - Solution: Implement a buddy system pairing more skilled students with those who need extra help

6. Weather Conditions:
   - Challenge: Unexpected rain or extreme heat during outdoor activities
   - Solution: Have a backup indoor location and alternative activities prepared

7. Environmental Impact:
   - Challenge: Overuse of natural resources in the practice area
   - Solution: Rotate building sites and emphasize Leave No Trace principles
