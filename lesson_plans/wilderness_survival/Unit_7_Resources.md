## Sustainable Foraging Ethics

1. Take only what you need
   - Avoid over-harvesting
   - Leave enough for wildlife and plant regeneration

2. Use proper harvesting techniques
   - Cut leaves and stems cleanly
   - Don't damage the main plant when harvesting fruits or flowers

3. Respect protected areas and private property
   - Obtain permission before foraging on private land
   - Follow regulations in national parks and reserves

4. Preserve biodiversity
   - Avoid harvesting rare or endangered species
   - Spread your impact by not taking too much from one area

5. Share knowledge responsibly
   - Teach others about sustainable practices
   - Be cautious about sharing locations of rare plants

6. Be aware of your impact
   - Stay on established trails when possible
   - Avoid trampling other plants while foraging

7. Consider the ecosystem
   - Some plants may be crucial food sources for wildlife
   - Understand the role of the plant in its environment

8. Practice proper identification
   - Never consume a plant you can't identify with 100% certainty
   - Use multiple sources to confirm identification

9. Respect local customs and knowledge
   - Learn from traditional practices
   - Acknowledge the cultural significance of certain plants

10. Give back to the environment
    - Participate in conservation efforts
    - Consider planting or spreading seeds of harvested species

# Discussion Questions

1. How does traditional Timorese knowledge of edible plants differ from modern scientific understanding? What are the benefits and limitations of each approach?

2. What role do edible wild plants play in food security for rural communities in Timor-Leste? How might this change with increasing urbanization?

3. How can we balance the desire to preserve traditional plant knowledge with the need to protect endangered species and ecosystems?

4. What are the potential risks of foraging for wild plants, and how can these risks be mitigated through education and proper practices?

5. How might climate change affect the availability and distribution of edible wild plants in Timor-Leste? What adaptations might be necessary?

6. In what ways can sustainable foraging practices contribute to conservation efforts in Timor-Leste?

7. How do cultural beliefs and practices surrounding certain plants influence their use and conservation in Timorese society?

8. What are the ethical considerations when sharing traditional plant knowledge with outsiders or for commercial purposes?

9. How can we encourage younger generations to learn about and value traditional plant knowledge in an increasingly modernized world?

10. What role should government policy play in regulating foraging practices and protecting wild plant resources in Timor-Leste?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Plant Profile Journal Entry

Choose one edible plant you encountered during the foraging walk. Write a detailed journal entry about this plant, including the following elements:

1. Physical description of the plant (size, shape, color, texture)
2. Where and how you found it (habitat, growing conditions)
3. Traditional and modern uses of the plant
4. Your personal experience with harvesting and tasting the plant
5. Any cultural stories or beliefs associated with the plant
6. Reflections on the plant's role in the local ecosystem
7. Ideas for sustainable harvesting and conservation of this species

Your journal entry should be 500-750 words long. Include a sketch or photograph of the plant if possible. Be sure to use descriptive language and incorporate relevant terminology from the lesson.

# Assignment Details

## Personal Field Guide Project

Create a personal field guide of 5 edible plants found in your local area. For each plant, include:

1. Detailed drawings or high-quality photographs (at least 2 views: whole plant and close-up of identifying features)
2. Scientific name and common local names
3. Key identification features (leaf shape, flower color, fruit characteristics, etc.)
4. Habitat and growing conditions
5. Traditional uses (food, medicine, crafts, etc.)
6. Proper harvesting methods and sustainable practices
7. Nutritional information (if available)
8. One recipe or preparation method
9. Any cautions or look-alike species to avoid

Format:
- Use A5 or A4 sized paper
- Create a cover page with a title and your name

- Use clear, legible handwriting or typed text
- Secure all pages in a folder or bind them together

Evaluation Criteria:
- Accuracy of information
- Clarity and detail of drawings/photographs
- Comprehensiveness of plant profiles
- Inclusion of sustainable harvesting practices
- Overall presentation and organization

Due Date: Two weeks from today's lesson

# Additional Materials

## Sample Plant Identification Key

Use this simplified key to help identify some common edible plants in Timor-Leste:

1. Plant is a tree
   A. Leaves are compound (multiple leaflets)
      - Fruit is a long pod → Ai-kafe (Leucaena leucocephala)
      - Fruit is brown and tamarind-like → Ai-dila (Tamarindus indica)
   B. Leaves are simple
      - Leaves are narrow and needle-like → Ai-kakeu (Casuarina equisetifolia)
      - Leaves are broad
        * Fruit is green and apple-like → Ai-dak (Schleichera oleosa)
        * Fruit is white and strong-smelling → Ai-biku (Morinda citrifolia)

2. Plant is a vine or ground cover
   A. Leaves are heart-shaped → Ai-lalata (Ipomoea pes-caprae)
   B. Leaves are compound with many small leaflets → Ai-tahan (Planchonia timorensis)

3. Plant is shrub-like
   A. Leaves are aromatic when crushed → Ai-katar (Eucalyptus alba)
   B. Plant grows near the coast, has leathery leaves → Ai-tasi (Sonneratia alba)

Remember, this is a simplified key and should be used in conjunction with other identification methods and expert guidance.

## Foraging Safety Guidelines

1. Always be 100% certain of a plant's identity before consuming it.
2. Carry a reliable field guide and consult multiple sources.
3. Start with small amounts when trying a new edible plant to check for allergies or sensitivities.
4. Avoid foraging in areas that may be contaminated with pesticides or pollutants.
5. Be aware of local regulations and obtain necessary permits for foraging.
6. Carry a first aid kit and know basic wilderness first aid.
7. Inform someone of your foraging plans and expected return time.
8. Wear appropriate clothing and footwear for the terrain.
9. Bring plenty of water and sun protection.
10. Be aware of potential hazards such as poisonous snakes or insects.
