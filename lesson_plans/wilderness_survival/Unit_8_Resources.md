# Lecture Notes

## Knife Safety and Handling

### Parts of a Knife
- Blade: The cutting portion of the knife
- Handle: The part you grip
- Edge: The sharpened part of the blade
- Spine: The top, unsharpened part of the blade
- Tip: The point of the blade
- Heel: The rear part of the edge, closest to the handle
- Tang: The part of the blade that extends into the handle

### Proper Grip Techniques
- Saber grip: Wrap all fingers around the handle, thumb on the spine
- Pinch grip: Thumb and forefinger pinch the blade near the handle, other fingers wrap around
- Chest-lever grip: For controlled carving, blade against chest, both hands on handle

### Safe Passing and Storage
- Always pass a knife handle-first
- Use a sheath when not in use
- Store knives in a dry place to prevent rust
- Never throw knives

## Axe Safety and Handling

### Parts of an Axe
- Head: The metal part containing the blade
- Bit: The sharpened edge of the axe head
- Poll: The flat back of the axe head
- Eye: The hole in the axe head where the handle fits
- Haft/Handle: The wooden or composite shaft
- Shoulder: Where the axe head meets the handle

### Proper Stance and Swing Technique
- Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
- Dominant hand at the end of the handle, other hand slides during swing
- Aim with the lower hand, power comes from the top hand
- Follow through with the swing, don't try to stop it abruptly

### Safe Storage and Transport
- Use a sheath or mask over the blade when transporting
- Store axes hanging or lying flat, never leaning against a wall
- Keep the blade oiled to prevent rust

## Traditional Timorese Tools

### Katana
- Long, machete-like knife
- Used for clearing brush and harvesting crops
- Cultural significance in rituals and ceremonies

### Ai Suak
- Traditional digging stick
- Used for planting and harvesting tubers
- Symbol of agricultural heritage

## Basic Tool Maintenance

### Cleaning
- Remove sap and debris after each use
- Use warm soapy water for thorough cleaning
- Dry completely to prevent rust

### Sharpening Techniques
- Use a whetstone for knives, file for axes
- Maintain the original angle of the blade
- Finish with a leather strop for a razor edge

### Proper Storage
- Store in a dry place
- Use sheaths or blade guards
- Oil metal parts to prevent rust

# Writing Exercise Instructions

Write a 500-word essay on one of the following topics:

1. The cultural significance of a traditional Timorese tool
2. A comparison between modern and traditional tool-making techniques
3. The importance of proper tool maintenance in bushcraft

Your essay should include:
- An introduction with a clear thesis statement
- At least three main points supporting your thesis
- Specific examples or evidence to support your arguments
- A conclusion that summarizes your main points and reinforces your thesis

# Assignment Details

## Research Project: Traditional Timorese Tool

1. Choose a traditional Timorese tool not covered in class
2. Research its history, design, and uses
3. Prepare a 5-minute presentation covering:
   - The tool's name and origin
   - Its design features and materials
   - Traditional and modern uses
   - Cultural significance
   - Any interesting facts or stories related to the tool
4. Create a visual aid (poster, slideshow, or physical model) to accompany your presentation

Due date: Next class session

# Additional Materials

## Knife Sharpening Guide

1. Choose the right whetstone (coarse for dull blades, fine for touch-ups)
2. Soak the stone in water for 10-15 minutes
3. Hold the blade at a 20-degree angle to the stone
4. Push the blade across the stone as if trying to slice off a thin layer
5. Repeat on both sides, maintaining the angle
6. Progress to finer grits for a sharper edge
7. Finish with a leather strop to remove any burrs

## Axe Safety Checklist

- Inspect the axe head and handle before each use
- Ensure the axe head is securely attached to the handle
- Clear the area of bystanders before swinging
- Wear closed-toe shoes and long pants
- Use both hands when swinging
- Keep the blade sharp to prevent glancing blows
- Never use an axe when tired or distracted
