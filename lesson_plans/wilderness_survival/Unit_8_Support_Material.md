   - Solution: Pair experienced students with beginners for peer learning. Provide additional support and simpler tasks for those who need it.

4. Time Management:
   - Challenge: Carving projects may take longer than expected.
   - Solution: Have pre-prepared stages of the carving project to allow students to experience the full process, even if they don't complete their own piece.

5. Resource Limitations:
   - Challenge: Limited availability of traditional tools or suitable carving wood.
   - Solution: Reach out to local communities or craftsmen for tool loans. Consider alternative materials or projects if traditional resources are scarce.
