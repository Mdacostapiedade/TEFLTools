## Excerpt from "Women and the Politics of Gender in Post-Conflict Timor-Leste" by Sara Niner

The status of women in Timor-Leste has been shaped by a complex interplay of traditional cultural practices, colonial influences, and the struggle for independence. Traditional Timorese society is largely patriarchal, with men holding primary decision-making power in both public and private spheres. The practice of barlake, often misinterpreted as a bride price, involves the exchange of gifts between families at marriage and can reinforce the idea of women as property.

Portuguese colonization introduced Catholic values, which further entrenched patriarchal norms while also providing some educational opportunities for women. The Indonesian occupation (1975-1999) saw widespread violence against women, but also their increased participation in the resistance movement. This participation challenged traditional gender roles and laid the groundwork for women's involvement in post-independence nation-building.

Since independence in 2002, Timor-Leste has made significant strides in promoting gender equality, including constitutional guarantees of equal rights and a quota system for women's political representation. However, challenges persist, including high rates of domestic violence, limited economic opportunities for women, and the continued influence of traditional gender norms.

## Relevant Sections from Timor-Leste's Constitution of 2002

# 6. Additional Materials and Examples

## Case Study Example: Maria's Story

Maria is a 28-year-old woman living in a rural village in Timor-Leste. She completed primary school but was unable to continue her education due to family financial constraints and the expectation that she would help with household duties. Maria is married with two children and works as a subsistence farmer alongside her husband.

Recently, Maria expressed interest in starting a small business selling vegetables at the local market. However, she faces several challenges:

1. Her husband is skeptical of the idea and prefers that she focus on household duties.
2. She lacks access to credit to start her business, as local lenders prefer to work with men.
3. She has limited financial literacy and business management skills.
4. Community members have expressed disapproval of women engaging in business activities outside the home.

Despite these challenges, Maria is determined to pursue her goal and seeks support from a local women's organization.

## Example of Traditional Conflict Resolution Method: Tara Bandu

Tara Bandu is a traditional Timorese practice used for conflict resolution and natural resource management. It involves a ceremony where community leaders establish rules and taboos to govern behavior and resource use. While Tara Bandu can be an effective tool for community governance, it has traditionally excluded women from decision-making processes.

Recent efforts have been made to integrate women into Tara Bandu practices, recognizing their important role in resource management and community well-being. This integration presents both opportunities and challenges for promoting gender equality within traditional cultural frameworks.

## Success Story: Dulce de Jesus Soares

Dulce de Jesus Soares served as Timor-Leste's Minister of Education from 2018 to 2020. She has been a lifelong advocate for education and women's rights in Timor-Leste. During the Indonesian occupation, Soares was involved in clandestine resistance activities and later played a crucial role in rebuilding the country's education system after independence.

As Minister of Education, Soares focused on improving access to education for girls and women, particularly in rural areas. She implemented policies to address barriers such as early marriage, lack of sanitation facilities in schools, and gender-based violence. Soares' story exemplifies the potential for women's leadership in Timor-Leste and the impact it can have on advancing gender equality.
