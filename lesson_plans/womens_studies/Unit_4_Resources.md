# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Women's Participation in Suco Elections

In 2016, Timor-Leste held elections for suco (village) councils, with new regulations requiring at least three women on each council. This case study examines the implementation of this quota and its impact on women's political participation at the local level.

### Background
- Sucos are the smallest administrative unit in Timor-Leste
- Previously, women's representation in suco councils was very low
- Law No. 9/2016 mandated inclusion of women in suco leadership

### Implementation
- Each suco council required to have:
  * 1 female delegate
  * 2 female representatives (one for women, one for youth)
- Challenges in finding candidates in some areas
- Training and support provided by NGOs and government agencies

### Outcomes
- Increased women's representation in local governance
- Greater visibility of women leaders in communities
- Some resistance from traditional power structures
- Varying levels of meaningful participation across different sucos

### Lessons Learned
- Importance of capacity building and ongoing support for women leaders
- Need to address cultural barriers and engage male allies
- Value of mentorship and networking among women in local politics

## Example: Successful Advocacy Campaign

The "Hau Prontu" (I'm Ready) campaign, launched in 2017 by local women's rights organizations, aimed to increase women's political participation in the 2018 parliamentary elections.

### Key Strategies
1. Media Campaign:
   - Radio spots featuring women leaders
   - Social media content highlighting women's contributions to politics
2. Voter Education:
   - Workshops in rural areas on the importance of women's political participation
   - Distribution of easy-to-understand materials on voting process
3. Candidate Support:
   - Training for women candidates on public speaking and campaign strategies
   - Mentorship program pairing experienced politicians with new candidates

### Results
- Increased public discourse on women's political participation
- Higher voter turnout among women in targeted areas
- Successful election of several first-time women candidates to parliament

This campaign demonstrates effective use of multiple advocacy strategies tailored to the Timorese context, combining media outreach, grassroots education, and direct support for women entering politics.
