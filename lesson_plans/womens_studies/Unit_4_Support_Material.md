## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may have varying levels of knowledge about Timor-Leste's political system.

   - **Solution**: Create a safe and respectful environment for sharing opinions. Use small group discussions before large group sharing to build confidence.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to relate to the concept of advocacy.
   - **Solution**: Use local, relatable examples of advocacy campaigns. Encourage students to think about issues in their own communities that they care about.

4. **Challenge**: The mock election campaign activity may become too competitive or divisive.
   - **Solution**: Emphasize that the focus is on developing and presenting ideas, not on winning. Encourage students to provide constructive feedback to each other.

   - **Solution**: Provide clear guidelines and examples. Consider having students work in pairs or small groups for peer support and feedback.
