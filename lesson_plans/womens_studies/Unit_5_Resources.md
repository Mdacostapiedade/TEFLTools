   - Brief description of the original initiative (country, target issue, key strategies)
   - Explanation of why this initiative would be relevant to Timor-Leste
   - Proposed adaptations to make the initiative culturally appropriate and feasible in Timor-Leste
   - Potential challenges in implementation and how to address them
   - Expected outcomes and benefits for women's health in Timor-Leste

4. Include at least three credible sources in your research, citing them properly in your proposal.

# Additional Materials

## Case Study: Maternal Health in Timor-Leste

Maria is a 22-year-old woman living in a rural village in Timor-Leste. She is pregnant with her second child and is hesitant to seek antenatal care at the nearest health clinic, which is a two-hour walk from her village. Her first childbirth was assisted by a traditional birth attendant at home, as is common in her community. Maria's husband believes that pregnancy and childbirth are women's matters and does not see the need for medical intervention.

Questions for discussion:
1. What are the potential risks for Maria and her unborn child in this situation?
2. How could community health workers address the barriers to antenatal care in Maria's case?
3. What strategies could be used to engage Maria's husband and other men in the community in maternal health issues?

## Role-play Scenario Cards

1. You are a community health worker talking to a young couple about family planning options. The husband is skeptical about using contraception due to religious beliefs.

2. You are a woman seeking help from a domestic violence support service. Explain your situation to the service provider and ask about available support options.

3. You are a midwife educating a pregnant woman about the importance of antenatal care and facility-based delivery. Address her concerns about leaving her other children at home to attend check-ups.

4. You are a teenage girl asking a health worker for information about reproductive health and contraception. Express your concerns about confidentiality and judgment from your community.
