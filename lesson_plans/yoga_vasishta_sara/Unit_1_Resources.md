# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from Yoga Vasishta: The Nature of Reality

"This world-appearance is a confusion, even as the blueness of the sky is an optical illusion. I think it is better not to let the mind dwell on it, but to ignore it. O Rama, it is better to live in a mountain-cave eating roots and leaves, than to live in society with the foolish and the ignorant. Neither scripture nor logic can enlighten the foolish who are engrossed in the objects of sense-pleasure.

Just as a mirror reflects objects, so also the body reflects consciousness, and consciousness reflects the body. But in truth, neither the body nor consciousness are real: the self alone is real. When this truth is realized, there is neither existence nor non-existence, neither body nor consciousness."

## Timorese Creation Story: The Origin of Timor

Long ago, when the world was young, there was only a vast ocean. From the depths of this ocean emerged a giant crocodile. As the crocodile swam, it grew larger and larger until it became an island. This island was Timor.

The first humans were born from the union of the sun and the moon. They descended onto the island and made it their home. The crocodile, now the land itself, promised to protect the people as long as they respected the balance of nature and honored their ancestors.

To this day, the Timorese people see the island as a living entity, with the mountains as its backbone and the rivers as its veins. They believe that all life on the island is interconnected, just as the crocodile's body became one with the land and sea.

# Lecture Notes

## Origins and Significance of Yoga Vasishta

1. Historical Context
   - Composed between 6th and 14th century CE
   - Part of the Advaita Vedanta tradition
   - Attributed to Sage Valmiki, but authorship is debated

2. Structure and Content
   - Contains about 32,000 verses
   - Structured as a dialogue between Sage Vasishta and Prince Rama
   - Covers topics such as creation, dissolution, nature of reality, and liberation

3. Significance in Indian Philosophy
   - Bridges Vedantic philosophy with practical spiritual instruction
   - Emphasizes the power of self-effort in spiritual realization
   - Introduces the concept of "Dristi-Sristi-Vada" (creation by perception)

4. Influence on Later Traditions
   - Inspired many later Advaita texts and teachers
   - Influenced the development of Kashmir Shaivism
   - Continues to be studied in modern spiritual circles

## Core Concepts of Advaita Vedanta

1. Brahman: The Ultimate Reality
   - Non-dual, infinite consciousness
   - Beyond attributes and descriptions
   - The substratum of all existence

2. Maya: The Illusion of Duality
   - Power that creates the appearance of multiplicity
   - Neither real nor unreal (anirvacaniya)
   - Veils the true nature of Brahman

3. Atman: The Individual Self
   - Identical with Brahman
   - Appears separate due to ignorance (avidya)
   - Realization of Atman-Brahman identity leads to liberation

4. Jiva: The Embodied Self
   - Atman associated with mind and body
   - Experiences the world of duality
   - Subject to karma and rebirth until liberation

5. Moksha: Liberation
   - Realization of one's true nature as Brahman
   - End of the cycle of birth and death
   - Attainable through knowledge (jnana) and self-inquiry

## Parallels with Timorese Traditional Beliefs

1. Interconnectedness of All Things
   - Advaita: All is Brahman
   - Timorese: Island as a living entity, all life interconnected

2. Respect for Nature
   - Advaita: Nature as a manifestation of Brahman
   - Timorese: Land as sacred, balance with nature

3. Ancestral Wisdom
   - Advaita: Lineage of realized sages
   - Timorese: Honoring ancestors, their continued influence

4. Non-Dual Reality
   - Advaita: Brahman as the sole reality
   - Timorese: Unity of land, sea, and people (crocodile myth)

5. Spiritual Realms
   - Advaita: Levels of consciousness and existence
   - Timorese: Belief in spirit world and its interaction with physical world

# Discussion Questions

1. How does the concept of Maya in Advaita Vedanta compare to the idea of illusion in your own experience?

2. In what ways might the Timorese creation story reflect a non-dualistic worldview?

3. How does the Advaita concept of Atman being identical to Brahman challenge or align with your personal beliefs about the nature of self?

4. Can you think of any practices or beliefs in Timorese culture that resonate with the Advaita idea of self-realization?

5. How might the understanding of interconnectedness in both Advaita and Timorese traditions influence one's relationship with the environment?

6. In what ways could the concept of Maya (illusion) be applied to understand social and cultural constructs in Timorese society?

7. How does the Advaita view of liberation (Moksha) compare with Timorese concepts of an ideal or enlightened state of being?

8. Can you identify any potential challenges in reconciling Advaita philosophy with traditional Timorese beliefs? How might these be addressed?

# Writing Exercise Instructions

## Reflective Writing on Personal Understanding of Reality and Consciousness

1. Find a quiet space where you can reflect undisturbed for at least 20 minutes.

2. Begin by taking a few deep breaths to center yourself.

4. Write continuously for 15 minutes, exploring your thoughts and beliefs about the nature of reality and consciousness. Consider the following questions as you write:
   - What do you believe is the fundamental nature of reality?
   - How do you understand consciousness? Is it limited to the brain, or is it more expansive?
   - How do your cultural background and personal experiences shape your views on reality and consciousness?
   - Have you had any experiences that have challenged your understanding of reality?

5. After 15 minutes, take a moment to read over what you've written.

6. In the final 5 minutes, reflect on how the concepts of Advaita Vedanta presented in the lesson relate to your personal views. Write a brief paragraph addressing this reflection.

7. Conclude your writing with one question that has arisen for you during this reflection process.

## Guided Meditation Script: Experiencing Non-Duality

Find a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.

Imagine yourself sitting on a beach, facing the ocean. Feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, hear the rhythmic sound of the waves.

Now, focus your attention on a single wave. Watch it form, rise, and then merge back into the ocean.

Reflect on how the wave, though it appears separate, is never truly distinct from the ocean. It's made of the same water, temporarily taking a different form.

Now, expand your awareness to include all the waves, the entire surface of the ocean. See how each wave is unique, yet all are essentially the same.

Gradually, let your perception shift. Instead of seeing yourself as separate from the ocean, imagine that you are the ocean itself. You are the vast body of water, experiencing itself as waves.

In this state, there is no separation between observer and observed. You are both the stillness of the depths and the motion of the surface.

Sit with this experience of non-duality for a few moments.

When you're ready, slowly bring your awareness back to your body and the room. Open your eyes.
