## Unit Resources

# Excerpts and Short Stories

## Excerpt from Yoga Vasishta on Brahman

"Brahman alone is real; it is infinite consciousness, omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient and free from all divisions and distinctions. It is pure existence, knowledge and bliss. The entire universe is but an appearance in this reality, like waves on the surface of the ocean."

## Excerpt on Consciousness and Perceived Reality

"The world exists because you perceive it. It is a creation of your mind. When the mind is transcended, the world disappears, and only pure consciousness remains. Just as a dreamer creates an entire dream world, so does consciousness create this apparent reality."

## Story: The Rope and the Snake

A man walking at dusk sees a coiled rope on the ground and mistakes it for a snake. He becomes frightened and runs away. Later, when he returns with a light, he realizes it was only a rope. This illustrates how our perceptions can create a false reality due to ignorance or limited understanding.

# Lecture Notes

## Brahman as Ultimate Reality

1. Definition of Brahman
   - The absolute, eternal, and unchanging reality

   - Non-dual (advaita) - no separation between subject and object
   - Self-luminous consciousness

3. Relationship to individual consciousness
   - Individual consciousness (atman) is identical to Brahman
   - Ignorance (avidya) causes the illusion of separation

## Role of Consciousness in Creating Perceived Reality

1. Yoga Vasishta's perspective on mind and reality
   - Mind is a manifestation of consciousness
   - Thoughts create the perception of the world
   - The world is a projection of consciousness

   - Consciousness vibrates as thought
   - Thoughts solidify into perceptions
   - Perceptions create the experience of the world

   - Dreams as a model for understanding waking reality
   - How expectations shape experiences
   - The power of belief in creating personal realities

   - Causes identification with body, mind, and ego
   - Creates the sense of duality and separation
   - Leads to attachment, desire, and suffering
