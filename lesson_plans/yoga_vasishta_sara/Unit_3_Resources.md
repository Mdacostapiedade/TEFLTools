## The Parable of the Sage and the Mirror

Once there was a sage who lived in a forest. A seeker came to him and asked, "Master, how can I know my true self?" The sage smiled and said, "Bring me a mirror." The seeker brought a mirror, and the sage asked him to look into it. "What do you see?" he asked. The seeker replied, "I see my face." The sage then covered the mirror with a cloth and asked, "Now what do you see?" The seeker said, "I see nothing but the cloth." The sage removed the cloth and asked again, "And now?" The seeker replied, "I see my face again." The sage then explained, "Your true self is like the mirror. It reflects all experiences but remains unchanged. The cloth represents the veil of ignorance that obscures your true nature. Self-inquiry is the process of removing this veil to recognize your unchanging, aware essence."

# Lecture Notes

## 1. Introduction to Self-Inquiry in Yoga Vasishta

- Self-inquiry (vichara) is a central practice in Yoga Vasishta
- Defined as the systematic investigation of one's true nature
- Aims to dispel ignorance and reveal the self as pure consciousness
- Differs from intellectual analysis; involves direct experiential insight
- Rooted in the understanding that the self is not the body, mind, or ego

## 2. Methods of Self-Inquiry

### A. Questioning Thoughts and Beliefs
- Systematically examine the source and validity of thoughts
- Ask "To whom does this thought occur?"
- Investigate the nature of the "I" that experiences thoughts

### B. Observing the Witness of Experiences
- Practice being aware of the awareness itself
- Notice the unchanging consciousness that perceives all changing phenomena
- Cultivate the ability to rest as the witness, rather than identifying with experiences

### C. Tracing Thoughts to Their Source
- Follow thoughts back to their origin in consciousness
- Notice the space between thoughts
- Recognize the underlying awareness from which thoughts arise

## 3. Obstacles to Self-Realization

### A. Identification with Body and Mind
- Mistaking the temporary vehicles of experience for the self
- Overcoming through consistent discrimination between self and non-self

### B. Attachment to Desires and Fears
- Emotional entanglements that reinforce ego-identity
- Practicing non-attachment and equanimity

### C. Habitual Thought Patterns
- Ingrained mental tendencies that obscure clear perception
- Cultivating mindfulness and breaking unconscious habits

## 4. Integrating Self-Inquiry into Daily Life

- Maintaining awareness during routine activities
- Using triggers (e.g., phone notifications) as reminders for self-inquiry
- Journaling insights and questions that arise throughout the day
- Practicing self-inquiry during moments of emotional reactivity
- Creating a daily schedule for formal self-inquiry practice

# Additional Materials

## Self-Inquiry Guided Meditation Script

Begin by sitting comfortably with your eyes closed. Take a few deep breaths to center yourself.

Now, gently ask yourself the question, "Who am I?" Don't try to answer intellectually, but simply let the question resonate within you.

Notice any thoughts, feelings, or sensations that arise in response to this question. Observe them without judgment.

As each thought or feeling appears, ask yourself, "To whom does this thought or feeling occur?" Notice the awareness that perceives these experiences.

Continue to rest in this awareness, allowing thoughts and sensations to come and go naturally.

If you find yourself getting caught up in thoughts, gently return to the question, "Who am I?"

Remember, you are not seeking a verbal answer, but rather a direct recognition of your true nature.

Remain in this state of open inquiry for the next few minutes.

(Allow 5-10 minutes of silence)

Slowly bring your attention back to your surroundings, carrying this sense of inquiry with you as you open your eyes.
