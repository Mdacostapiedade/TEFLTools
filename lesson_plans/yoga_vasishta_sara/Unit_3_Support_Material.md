## 5. Tips for Teachers on Potential Challenges and How to Address Them

1. **Challenge**: Students may find self-inquiry abstract or confusing.
   - **Solution**: Use concrete examples and analogies from daily life. Encourage students to start with simple observations of their thoughts and feelings.

2. **Challenge**: Some students may experience resistance or discomfort during self-inquiry.
   - **Solution**: Normalize these experiences and emphasize that resistance is part of the process. Encourage gentle persistence and self-compassion.

3. **Challenge**: Students may struggle to differentiate between genuine self-inquiry and intellectual analysis.
   - **Solution**: Emphasize the experiential nature of self-inquiry. Guide students to notice the felt sense of awareness rather than getting caught in conceptual thinking.

4. **Challenge**: Cultural or religious beliefs may conflict with some aspects of self-inquiry teachings.
   - **Solution**: Present self-inquiry as a complementary practice rather than a replacement for existing beliefs. Encourage students to explore how self-inquiry can deepen their understanding of their own traditions.

5. **Challenge**: Students may report unusual experiences or altered states during self-inquiry practice.
   - **Solution**: Provide a safe space for sharing experiences without judgment. Remind students that all experiences, no matter how profound, are temporary, and to continue inquiring into the nature of the one who experiences.
