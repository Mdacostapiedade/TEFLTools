# Excerpts and Short Stories

## The Importance of Meditation from Yoga Vasishta

"Meditation is the only raft with which to cross the ocean of samsara (cycle of birth and death). Without it, one drowns in sorrow. Therefore, one should practice meditation regularly and with great enthusiasm.

The mind is like a lake. When it is still, one can see the bottom clearly. Similarly, when the mind is still through meditation, one can perceive the true nature of the Self.

Just as a mirror reflects objects clearly when it is clean, the mind reflects the truth when it is purified through meditation. Therefore, strive to make your mind still and pure through regular practice."

## Parable of the Two Birds

"Two birds, inseparable companions, perch on the same tree. One eats the sweet fruit, while the other looks on without eating.

The first bird represents the individual self, caught up in the experiences of life, tasting the fruits of its actions. The second bird represents the witnessing consciousness, the true Self that observes without attachment.

Through meditation, one realizes that one is not the bird eating the fruit, but the bird that watches. This realization leads to freedom from the cycle of pleasure and pain."

## Guided Meditation Script: Breath Awareness

Find a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths to settle in.

Now, bring your attention to your natural breath. Don't try to change it, just observe it as it is.

Notice the sensation of the breath entering and leaving your nostrils. Feel the coolness of the inhale and the warmth of the exhale.

As you continue to breathe naturally, be aware of the rise and fall of your chest and abdomen.

If your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to the breath. There's no need to judge yourself; mind-wandering is natural.

Continue observing your breath for the next few minutes, staying present with each inhale and exhale.

(Allow 5-10 minutes of silent practice)

Slowly bring your awareness back to your surroundings. When you're ready, gently open your eyes.

## Quote for Contemplation

"As the ocean remains unmoved though waves rise and fall on its surface, so does the wise one remain unmoved by the varied experiences of life." - Yoga Vasishta

Reflect on how this quote relates to the practice of meditation and witnessing consciousness.
