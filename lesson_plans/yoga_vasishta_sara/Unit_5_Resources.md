## The Story of Leela

Once there was a king named Padma who ruled over a prosperous kingdom. His queen, Leela, was devoted to him and feared losing him. She prayed to the goddess Saraswati to grant her husband immortality. Saraswati appeared and explained that immortality was impossible, but offered Leela a boon: when Padma died, his soul would remain in their palace.

Soon after, Padma died. Leela, grief-stricken, prayed again to Saraswati. The goddess appeared and showed Leela that what she perceived as reality was merely a creation of her own mind. Saraswati took Leela on a journey through multiple realities, revealing that time and space were illusions.

They witnessed Padma living another life as a king in a different realm, unaware of his previous existence. Leela realized that all experiences, including life and death, were like dreams within dreams. She understood the true nature of consciousness and attained self-realization.

## The Parable of the Crow and the Palm Fruit

A crow once perched on a palm tree, eyeing a ripe fruit. Just as the crow was about to peck at the fruit, it fell from the tree. The crow flew away, thinking its attempt to eat the fruit had caused it to fall.

In reality, a rat had been gnawing at the fruit's stem, causing it to drop at that precise moment. The crow's action and the fruit's fall were unrelated, yet appeared to be cause and effect.

This parable illustrates that our actions and their apparent results are often not directly related. What we perceive as our doing may be the result of unseen factors. It teaches us to act without attachment to results and to recognize the complex interplay of forces beyond our control.
