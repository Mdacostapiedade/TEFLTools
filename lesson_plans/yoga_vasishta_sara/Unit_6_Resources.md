# Excerpts and Short Stories

## The Story of King Janaka's Instant Enlightenment

Long ago, there lived a great king named Janaka who ruled over the kingdom of Videha. Though he was a just and wise ruler, he felt a deep longing for spiritual knowledge and liberation.

One day, as he sat on his throne, a group of sages arrived at his court. Janaka welcomed them and asked, "O wise ones, please tell me how I can attain enlightenment."

One sage replied, "O King, enlightenment is not something that can be attained through effort or time. It is your very nature, always present and ever-free."

Hearing these words, Janaka's mind became still. In that moment of clarity, he realized the truth of his own being. He exclaimed, "I am That! I have always been free!"

From that day forward, King Janaka lived as a jivanmukta, liberated while still performing his royal duties. He ruled his kingdom with wisdom and compassion, ever-established in the knowledge of his true self.

## Excerpt from Yoga Vasishta on the Nature of a Liberated Being

"The liberated sage is free from elation and depression. He is not affected by praise or censure. He sees the same self in all beings and all beings in the self. His actions are spontaneous and free from motive. He has no sense of doership or enjoyment. He is established in equanimity, seeing the entire universe as a play of consciousness. Such a one, though living and acting in the world, is ever free and at peace."

   - Dissolution of ego and sense of separate self
   - Living from a state of non-dual awareness

   - Jivanmukti: liberation here and now, while still embodied

4. Significance in Yoga Vasishta:
