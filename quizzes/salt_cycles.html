            // Comprehension questions
            { question: "What are the main salt ions mentioned in the video?", answer: "sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, bicarbonate, and sulfate", tip: "The video specifically mentions these ions as the main players in the salt cycle." },
            { question: "How do humans impact the salt cycle?", answer: "By moving salts around the cycle faster and at higher quantities than natural processes", tip: "According to the video, human activities are causing salts to move through the cycle at an accelerated rate and in larger quantities than natural processes alone." },
            { question: "What are some examples of human activities that contribute to disrupting the salt cycle?", answer: "Mining, fertilizer use, detergent use, road salt", tip: "The video mentions these specific human activities as contributors to the disruption of the natural salt cycle." },
            { question: "Why is the disrupted salt cycle a concern for soil and water?", answer: "Salts blown by wind can wreck soil fertility, and increased chloride levels in freshwater can lead to algal blooms", tip: "The video explains that wind-blown salts can negatively impact soil fertility, and high chloride levels in freshwater can cause algal blooms." },
            { question: "What are some potential health impacts of the disrupted salt cycle?", answer: "Increased salt in drinking water can lead to high blood pressure, saltier groundwater can cause radioactive elements to leach into aquifers", tip: "According to the video, increased salt in drinking water can raise blood pressure, and saltier groundwater can cause radioactive elements to leach into aquifers used for drinking water." },
            { question: "What is one of the major sources of salt runoff mentioned in the video?", answer: "Road deicing (road salt)", tip: "The video specifically calls out the use of road salt for deicing as a major contributor to salt runoff." },
            { question: "What is an example of a negative consequence of the disrupted salt cycle mentioned in the video?", answer: "The drying up of the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan, leading to salt being carried by wind and impacting neighboring countries", tip: "The video uses the example of the drying up of the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan, which has led to wind-blown salt impacting neighboring countries." },
            { question: "What does the video suggest is needed to address the disrupted salt cycle?", answer: "A clearer understanding of human effects on salt transport, effective limits on salt use, and more information from the global south", tip: "The video states that we need a better understanding of how human activities impact salt transport, effective limits on salt use, and more input from the global south." },
            { question: "According to the video, how much salt runoff from road deicing alone enters the freshwater system in the United States?", answer: "37.8 megatonnes", tip: "The video provides the specific figure of 37.8 megatonnes of salt runoff from road deicing alone in the United States." },
            { question: "What is one potential solution mentioned in the video for addressing the disrupted salt cycle?", answer: "Understanding the impacts and setting effective limits on salt use", tip: "The video suggests that understanding the impacts of human salt use and setting effective limits could help address the disruption of the salt cycle." }
