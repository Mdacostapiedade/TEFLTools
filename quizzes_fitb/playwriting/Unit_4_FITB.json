For example, a play might focus on a young woman navigating the dual pressures of traditional gender roles and the desire for education and career advancement, thereby illuminating the wider issue of gender inequality in Timorese society.\\n\\nDialogue plays a crucial role in revealing societal attitudes and tensions within Timorese plays. Playwrights skillfully craft conversations that expose the conflicting viewpoints and values held by different segments of the population.
