  "reading": "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental paradigm in modern software development that has revolutionized the way programmers design and structure their code. This approach to programming is based on the concept of \\\"[BLANK_1],\\\" which are self-contained units that combine data and functionality. OOP provides a powerful and intuitive way to model real-world entities and their interactions within a software system.\\n\\nAt its core, OOP is built upon four main principles: [BLANK_2], abstraction, [BLANK_3], and [BLANK_4]. These principles work together to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code. [BLANK_2] refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or object. This concept helps in hiding the internal details of how an object works, exposing only what is necessary. Abstraction allows programmers to focus on essential features while hiding unnecessary details. [BLANK_3] enables the creation of new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship between classes. [BLANK_4] allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly, providing flexibility in how objects respond to the same method call.\\n\\nThe fundamental building block of OOP is the [BLANK_5]. A [BLANK_5] serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the [BLANK_6] (data) and [BLANK_7] (functions) that the objects of that [BLANK_5] will possess. For instance, consider a [BLANK_5] representing a car. The [BLANK_6] might include properties such as color, make, and model, while [BLANK_7] could include actions like start_engine(), accelerate(), and brake().\\n\\nOnce a [BLANK_5] is defined, objects can be instantiated from it. These objects, also known as [BLANK_8], are concrete representations of the [BLANK_5]. Each object has its own set of [BLANK_6] values but shares the same [BLANK_7] defined in the [BLANK_5]. For example, we could create multiple car objects, each with different colors and models, but all sharing the ability to start their engines or accelerate.\\n\\nIn Python, a popular language for OOP, classes are defined using the 'class' keyword. Here's a simple example of a Car class:\\n\\n```python\\nclass Car:\\n    def [BLANK_9](self, make, model, color):\\n        self.make = make\\n        self.model = model\\n        self.color = color\\n\\n    def start_engine(self):\\n        print(f\\\"The {self.color} {self.make} {self.model}'s engine is starting.\\\")\\n\\n    def accelerate(self):\\n        print(f\\\"The {self.color} {self.make} {self.model} is accelerating.\\\")\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the [BLANK_9] method is a special [BLANK_10] that initializes the object's [BLANK_6] when it's created. The self parameter refers to the [BLANK_8] being created or operated on.",
