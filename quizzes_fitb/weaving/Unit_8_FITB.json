Competition from machine-made textiles, changing consumer preferences, and the need for consistent quality control are ongoing issues. However, the unique [BLANK_7] of handwoven products – their cultural significance, individuality, and artisanal quality – continues to create opportunities in niche markets.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nWeaving for economic development represents a promising approach to sustainable livelihood creation, particularly in regions with strong textile traditions.
