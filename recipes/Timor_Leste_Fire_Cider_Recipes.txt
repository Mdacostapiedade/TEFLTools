Timor-Leste specific ingredients:

Tua sabu, or palm wine vinegar, is a staple in Timorese cuisine and is made from the fermented sap of the palm tree. It is rich in probiotics and is believed to aid digestion and boost immunity. Apple cider vinegar is traditionally used in places like the United States.

Ai-manas (chili peppers) and saboko peppers are widely used in Timorese cooking and traditional medicine. They contain capsaicin, which has anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties. Some studies suggest that capsaicin may also have potential in cancer treatment.

Moringa (Moringa oleifera) is a nutrient-dense plant native to Timor-Leste. It is high in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and has been used traditionally to treat various ailments, including malnutrition, inflammation, and infections. Recent research has shown that moringa may have potential in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer.

Ai-tahan (Euphorbia hirta) and ai-lele (Aegle marmelos) are medicinal plants used by the Mambai people. Ai-tahan has been studied for its potential in treating respiratory issues, while ai-lele has shown promise in managing digestive disorders and boosting immunity.
