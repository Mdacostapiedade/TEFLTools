# Basic DIY Toothpaste Recipes

## Water-Based Toothpaste

**Ingredients**
* 2/3 cup **baking soda**
* 1 tsp. **fine sea salt**
* Filtered water
* 1-2 tsp. **organic arrowroot powder** (optional thickener)

**Directions**
1. Combine baking soda and salt.
2. Add water little by little, stirring well after each addition, until paste reaches desired consistency.
3. If additional thickness is desired, add 1 to 2 teaspoons of arrowroot powder and stir to combine. Start with a small amount, add more until desired thickness is reached.
4. Store in a cool, dark place for 1 to 2 weeks.

Oil based toothpaste can have a longer shelf life than water based recipes, lasting two to three weeks on average. Here is a basic toothpaste recipe using coconut oil in place of water.

## Coconut Oil Toothpaste

**Ingredients**
* 2-3 tsp. **baking soda**
* 1 tsp. **fine sea salt**
* 1/4 cup **organic coconut oil** (or **MCT oil**)
* 1-2 tsp. **organic arrowroot powder** (optional)

**Directions**
1. Combine baking soda and salt.
2. Add softened or MCT coconut oil to dry ingredients. Stir with fork to combine.
3. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of arrowroot powder to this recipe after all other ingredients are mixed to help thicken the paste. Start with a small amount, add more until desired thickness is reached.
4. Store in a cool, dark place for up to 3 weeks.

**Pro Tips**
* During warmer months, toothpaste made with solid coconut oil may become runny.
* When making the oil-based recipe, solid or liquid (MCT) coconut oil can be used interchangeably, but quantities may need to be adjusted depending on desired consistency.
* You can dip a toothbrush directly into the paste, but doing so has the potential to introduce bacteria into the mix that can make your paste spoil more quickly. To maximize shelf life, use a small scoop to remove toothpaste from jar as needed.
