Tinctures (Tincturae):
Description: An alcoholic or hydroalcoholic extract of plant material. Tinctures are easy to prepare, have a long shelf life, and are quickly absorbed by the body. However, they may not be suitable for those who wish to avoid alcohol.

Instructions:
1. Select the desired herb and grind it to a fine powder to increase surface area and maximize extraction.
2. Place the ground herb in a clean, dry glass jar with a tight-fitting lid.
3. Cover the herb with the appropriate strength of alcohol (usually 40-60% ethanol), ensuring that the herb is completely submerged.
4. Seal the jar tightly and store it in a cool, dark place for 2-6 weeks, depending on the herb and desired strength of the tincture.
5. Shake the jar daily to facilitate extraction and prevent the herb from settling at the bottom.
6. After the desired maceration time, strain the liquid through a fine cheesecloth or muslin, squeezing the herb material to extract as much liquid as possible.
7. Press the remaining herb material using a tincture press or similar device to extract any remaining liquid.
8. If necessary, filter the strained liquid through a coffee filter or paper filter to remove any fine sediment.
9. Store the finished tincture in a clean, dark glass bottle with a dropper top for easy dosing. Label the bottle with the herb name, alcohol strength, and date of preparation.
10. Tinctures can be stored for several years in a cool, dark place, but it is best to use them within 1-2 years for optimal potency.
