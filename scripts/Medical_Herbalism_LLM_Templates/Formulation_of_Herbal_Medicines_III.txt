DRY PREPARATIONS FOR HERBALISTS

Dry preparations are an important form of herbal medicine, offering convenience, precise dosing, and extended shelf life. These forms include capsules, pills, tablets, and lozenges/pastilles. Each has its own advantages and preparation methods.

1. CAPSULES

Description:
Capsules are gelatin or vegetable-based shells filled with powdered herbs or extracts. They offer a convenient way to take herbs without tasting them and allow for precise dosing.

Advantages:
- Tasteless, making it easier to take bitter or unpleasant-tasting herbs
- Precise dosing
- Easy to carry and store
- Protect herbs from light and air

Preparation Method:
a) Grind dried herbs into a fine powder using a herb grinder or coffee grinder.
b) If using a capsule machine:
   - Place empty capsule halves in the machine.
   - Spread the powdered herb over the capsules.
   - Use the spreading tool to fill the capsules evenly.
   - Place the caps on the filled halves and press to close.
c) If filling manually:
   - Open the capsule and fill the larger half with the powdered herb.
   - Press the smaller half onto the filled half to close.

- Can mask unpleasant tastes

Preparation Method:
a) Grind herbs into a fine powder.
b) Mix the powder with a binding agent such as honey, syrup, or marshmallow root powder.
c) Knead the mixture until it forms a pliable dough.
d) Roll small portions of the dough into balls of uniform size.
e) Roll the pills in a coating powder (like slippery elm or cinnamon) to prevent sticking.
