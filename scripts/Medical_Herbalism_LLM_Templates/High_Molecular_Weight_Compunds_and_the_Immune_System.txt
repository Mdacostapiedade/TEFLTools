High-Molecular-Weight Compounds 

Many high-molecular-weight plant compounds also affect the immune system. The most important are polysaccharides and glycoproteins.

Polysaccharides
Many polysaccharides, especially glucans, have immunostimulatory properties. Glucans from mushrooms like shiitake (Lentinus edodes) and reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) can enhance immune function. Polysaccharides from herbs like astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) and echinacea (Echinacea spp.) also stimulate the immune system.

Pectic polysaccharides and arabinogalactans are found in many plants and have immunostimulant effects. Examples include angelica (Angelica acutiloba), chamomile (Matricaria recutita), and echinacea (Echinacea purpurea).

Glycoproteins
Some glycoproteins, which are proteins attached to sugars, also affect immune activity. Lectins like mistletoe lectin I from European mistletoe (Viscum album) and pokeweed mitogen from pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) have immunomodulating properties.

Summary
In conclusion, many herbal constituents from different chemical classes modulate immune function in various ways. While alkaloids and terpenes have shown some effects, polysaccharides and glycoproteins appear to be the most active compounds.  More research is still needed to fully understand how these natural substances interact with the complex human immune system. However, traditional use of immunostimulant herbs is validated by growing scientific evidence.
