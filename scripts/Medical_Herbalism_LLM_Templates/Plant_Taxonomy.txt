Classification of Medicinal Plants

Plants can be classified, or grouped, in different ways. These classifications help us understand relationships between plants and can suggest ways to research their medicinal properties. Here are some common methods for classifying medicinal plants:

Alphabetical
Plants are listed alphabetically by their scientific Latin name or common English name. This makes them easy to look up but doesn't tell us about their medicinal uses.

Taxonomic  
Plants are grouped based on their botanical relationships - which class, order, family, genus and species they belong to, according to what botanists currently think. 
<List examples of plants where the plants are related and are found in or native to the Host Country.>

Morphologic
Plants are grouped based on shared physical features, like leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, roots, etc. Plant parts used medicinally are called "organized drugs".
<List examples of plants and their parts where the plants are found in or native to the Host Country.>

Therapeutic
There are several ways to group plants by their medicinal effects:
- Based on the actions they have on the body

- By the body systems or organs they affect
  <List examples of plants and the body parts/organs they effect they where the plants are found in or native to the Host Country.>
- According to different medicinal traditions, like Western, Ayurvedic or Chinese

- By their chemical constituents
  <List examples of plants and their chemical consituents that are native to the Host Country.>
- Based on their evolutionary relationships

- By the ways different cultures around the world use them

Plant Taxonomy and Phytotherapy

A plant's scientific name, or Latin binomial, can tell us a lot about the plant. The first part is the genus name, and the second part, the specific epithet, identifies the particular species. Botanical names are precise and recognized worldwide.

Sometimes plant names change as botanists make new discoveries. For example, the mint family was renamed from Labiatae to Lamiaceae. It's important for herbalists to know the current correct names so they can be sure which exact plant they are using.

The meaning of botanical names often reflects useful information about the plants - where they grow, what they look like, traditional uses, and the people involved in their discovery.
