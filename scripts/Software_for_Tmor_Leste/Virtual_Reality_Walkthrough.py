# Virtual Reality (VR) Getting Started Guide for Python Beginners

"""
Overview of Virtual Reality (VR):
Virtual Reality is a technology that creates a simulated environment, allowing users to interact
with 3D worlds using special hardware like headsets and controllers. VR has applications in
gaming, education, training, and many other fields.

This guide will walk you through:
1. Understanding basic VR concepts
2. Setting up a simple VR environment using Python
3. Creating a basic VR scene
4. Handling user input in VR
5. Updating the VR display

By the end of this guide, you'll have a simple VR project that displays a room with a cube
and allows you to move around using simulated VR controllers.

What is PyVR?
PyVR is a hypothetical Python library for VR development. In a real project, you'd use 
actual VR SDKs like OpenVR or Oculus SDK. We're using PyVR here to simplify the concepts
for beginners.
"""

# Step 1: Setting up the environment
# First, we need to install the necessary libraries. In a real project, you would do this using pip:
# pip install pyvr

# Let's import our hypothetical PyVR library
import pyvr

# We'll also need a library for 3D mathematics. In this example, we'll use a simplified version.
import math

# Step 2: Creating a basic VR system class
class SimpleVRSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize variables to store our VR system state
        self.hmd = None  # This will represent our headset
        self.controllers = []  # This list will store our controllers
        self.scene = []  # This list will store objects in our VR scene

    def initialize(self):
        # This method sets up our VR system
        print("Initializing VR system...")
        self.hmd = "HMD Initialized"  # In a real system, this would be an actual device
        self.controllers = ["Left Controller", "Right Controller"]  # Simulating two controllers
        print(f"VR System initialized with {self.hmd} and {len(self.controllers)} controllers")

    def get_hmd_pose(self):
        # In a real system, this would return the actual position of the headset
        # Here, we're just returning a fixed position
        return (0, 1.6, -1)  # Represents (x, y, z) coordinates

    def get_controller_poses(self):
        # Similarly, this would return actual controller positions
        # We're returning fixed positions for simplicity
        return [(0.2, 1.2, -0.5), (-0.2, 1.2, -0.5)]  # Left and right controller positions

# Step 3: Creating a simple VR scene
