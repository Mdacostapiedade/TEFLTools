Course Title: Sustainable Beekeeping: A Permaculture Approach
Course Description:
This hands-on course provides a comprehensive exploration of natural beekeeping methods through the lens of permaculture principles. Students will gain theoretical knowledge and practical skills for establishing and maintaining healthy, resilient bee colonies integrated within diverse, regenerative systems. The curriculum covers bee biology, apiary management, hive designs, integrated planting for pollinators, working with the local bee species, and creating community around beekeeping. Students will have the opportunity to work directly with bees, construct natural hives, and experience the rhythms and cycles of the apiary. The course emphasizes locally-adapted, low-input solutions that harmonize with nature and traditional wisdom practices.
Learning Objectives:
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

Understand the principles of natural beekeeping and its relationship to permaculture ethics
Articulate the anatomy, lifecycle, and behavior of honey bees
Establish bee-friendly gardens and food forests to support pollinator health
Construct and maintain different styles of top-bar and horizontal hives
Work with locally adapted bee species and races
Implement natural management practices throughout the beekeeping seasons
Capture wild swarms and induce natural propagation of hives
Harvest bee products sustainably without chemical treatments
Integrate bees within holistic home and farm-scale systems
Build community networks and share knowledge around natural beekeeping
