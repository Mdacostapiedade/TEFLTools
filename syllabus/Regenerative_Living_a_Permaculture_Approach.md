# Course Title: Regenerative Living: A Permaculture Approach

## Course Description:
This hands-on program immerses participants in the principles and practices of permaculture, equipping them with the knowledge and skills to design and implement sustainable, resilient living systems. Through a blend of classroom learning and field practice, students will explore regenerative approaches to water, soil, food, shelter, and community. The curriculum is grounded in both time-tested traditional wisdom and innovative ecological design, with a focus on locally appropriate solutions. Graduates will be prepared to serve as leaders and educators, guiding their communities towards a more secure, abundant, and connected way of life in harmony with nature.

## Learning Objectives: 
By the end of this program, students will be able to conceptually understand how to:
- Articulate the ethics and principles of permaculture design
- Conduct site assessments and develop integrated designs for homes, farms, and communities
- Implement water harvesting and conservation strategies, such as swales, ponds, and keyline design
- Build living soils through composting, vermicomposting, and other regenerative practices 
- Establish diverse perennial food systems, including food forests and forest gardens
- Raise small animals like chickens and bees in ecologically-integrated systems
- Construct simple structures using natural, locally-sourced materials 
- Preserve and enhance the value of harvests through fermenting, canning, and other methods
- Facilitate participatory design processes to create resilient, locally-adapted solutions

Through this dynamic exploration of regenerative systems, students will develop the practical skills and embodied wisdom to create resilient, thriving communities. The program aims to empower a network of local leaders and innovators, working together to revitalize traditional knowledge, heal ecosystems, and grow vibrant futures. Participants will leave with the confidence and capabilities to turn their homes, neighborhoods and landscapes into verdant, productive living systems, while building a culture of collaboration, creativity and connection to the living earth.
