# Human Anatomy and Physiology for Nursing Students in Timor-Leste

## Course Overview and Objectives

This course provides nursing students in Timor-Leste with a comprehensive introduction to human anatomy and physiology. It covers the fundamental structures and functions of the human body from the cellular level to organ systems. The content emphasizes the interrelationships between body systems and how they work together to maintain homeostasis, which is crucial knowledge for nursing practice and patient care in the Timorese healthcare context. Students will gain practical skills in identifying anatomical structures and understanding physiological processes relevant to common health issues in Timor-Leste.

Course objectives:
- Understand the levels of structural organization in the human body
