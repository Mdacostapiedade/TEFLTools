Here is a suggested syllabus for a program on sustainable aquaculture management in Timor-Leste, based on the key points from the document:

# Sustainable Aquaculture Management for Timor-Leste

## Course Overview and Objectives

This course aims to provide students with the knowledge and skills to implement sustainable aquaculture practices in Timor-Leste. The program will cover key principles of the ecosystem approach to aquaculture (EAA), focusing on spatial planning, water quality management, and disease control. Students will learn how to apply these concepts to the local context of Timor-Leste's developing aquaculture sector.
