CORRECTIONS TO ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS. 59

CHAPTER III.

CORRECTIONS TO ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS, DIP OF
THE HORIZON, PARALLAX, SEMI-DIAMETER, REFRAC-
TION, AND TWILIGHT.

81. Dip of the Horizon. |In observations of the altitude of a
heavenly body at sea, where the measurement is made from the sea-
line, a correction is needed on account of the fact that this visible
horizon does not coincide with the true astronomical horizon (which
is 90from the zenith), but falls sensibly below it by an amount
known as the Dip of the Horizon . The amount of this dip depends
upon the size of the earth and the height of the observer's eye above
the sea-level.

Fig. 33. |Dip of
the Horizon.In Fig. 33,Cis the centre of the earth, ABa
portion of its level surface, and Othe observer,
at an elevation haboveA. The lineOHis truly
horizontal, while the tangent line, OB, corre-
sponds to the line drawn from the eye to the vis-
ible horizon. The angle HOB is the dip. This is
obviously equal to the angle OCB at the centre
of the earth, if we regard the earth as spherical,
as we may do with quite sucient accuracy for
the purpose in hand.

From the right-angled triangle OBC we have
directly

cosOCB =BC
CO:

PuttingRfor the radius of the earth, and  for the dip, this be-
comes

cos  =R
R+h:

This formula is exact, but inconvenient, because it gives the small
angle  by means of its cosine. Since, however, 1  cos  = 2 sin21
2,

CORRECTIONS TO ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS. 60

we easily obtain the following:|

sin1
2 =s
h
2(R+h):

This gives the true depression of the sea horizon, as it would be if
the line of sight, drawn from the eye to the horizon line, were straight .
On account of refraction it is not straight, however, and the amount of
this \terrestrial refraction" is very variable and uncertain. It is usual
to diminish the dip computed from the formula by one-eighth its whole
amount.

An approximate formula1for the dip is

 (in minutes of arc) =p
h(feet);

1This approximate formula may be obtained thus:|

2 sin2(1
2) =h
R+h=h

:

But sinceh
Ris a very small fraction, it may be neglected in the divisor

1 +h
R
, and the expression becomes simply,

2 sin21
2 =h
R; whence sin1
2 =r

Since  is a very small angle,

 = sin  = 2 sin1
2;so that

 (in radians ) = 2r
h
2R=s

2R:

To reduce radians to minutes, we must multiply by 3438, the number of
minutes in a radian. Accordingly,

0(in minutes of arc) = 3438s
h
1
2R:

If we express hin feet, we must also use the same units for R. The mean
radius of the earth is about 20,884,000 feet, one-half of which is 10,442,000, and
the square root of this is 3231; so that the formula becomes

0=3438
3231p
h(feet);

which is near enough to that given in the text.

In fact, the refraction makes so much dierence that after taking the nu-
merical factor,3438
3231, as unity, the formula still gives 0about1
20part too
large.

The formula 0=p
3h(metres ) is yet more nearly correct.

CORRECTIONS TO ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS. 61

or, in words, the square root of the elevation of the eye (in feet )gives
the dip in minutes . This gives a value about1
20part too large.

Since the dip is applicable only to sextant observations made at
sea, where, from the nature of the instrument, and the rising and
falling of the observer with the vessel's motion, it is not possible to
measure altitudes more closely than within about 1500, there is no
need of any extreme precision in its calculation.

82. Parallax. |In the most general sense, \parallax" is the
change of a body's direction resulting from the observer's displace-
ment. In the restricted and technical sense in which we are to
employ it now, it may be dened as the dierence between the di-
rection of a body as actually observed and the direction it would have
if seen from the earth's centre. Thus in the gure, Fig. 34, where
the observer is supposed to be at O, the position of Pin the sky (as
seen fromO) would be marked by the point where OPproduced
would pierce the celestial sphere. Its position as seen from Cwould
be determined in the same way by producing CPto whichOXis
drawn parallel. The angle POX , therefore, or its equal, OPC , is
the parallax of Pfor an observer at O.

Fig. 34. |Diurnal Parallax.Obviously, from the gure, we may
also give the following denition of the
parallax. It is the angular distance
(number of seconds of arc) between the
observer's station and the centre of the
earth's disc, as seen from the body ob-
served . The moon's parallax at any mo-
ment for me is my angular distance from
the earth's centre, as seen by \the man
in the moon."

When a body is in the zenith its par-
allax is zero, and it is a maximum at the horizon. In all cases
itdepresses a body, diminishing the altitude without changing the
azimuth.

The \law" of the parallax is, that it varies as the sine of the
zenith distance directly, and inversely as the linear distance (in
miles) of the body.

This follows easily from the triangle COP , where we have PC:
OC= sinCOP : sinCPO .

PutDforPC, the distance of the body from the earth; Rfor the

earth's radius, CO;CPO , the parallax; forZOP , the apparent
zenith distance, and remember that the sine of is equal to the
sine of its supplement, COP : we then have as the translation of the
above proportion,

D:R= sin: sinp:

This gives us sin p=R
Dsin;

or, sincepis always a small angle,

p00= 20626500R
Dsin:

83. Horizontal Parallax. |When a body is at the horizon ( Ph
in the gure), then becomes 90, and sin= 1. In this case the
parallax reaches its maximum value, which is called the horizontal
parallax of the body. Taking phas the symbol for this, we have

sinph=R
D; or, nearly enough, ph= 20626500R
D:

Comparing this with the formula above, we see that the parallax of a
body at any zenith distance equals the horizontal parallax multiplied
by the sine of the zenith distance ; i.e.,p=phsin.

N.B. A glance at the gure will show that we may dene the
horizontal parallax ,OPC , of any body, as the angular semi-diameter
of the earth seen from that body . To say, for instance, that the sun's
horizontal parallax is 800:8, amounts to saying that, seen from the
sun, the earth's apparent diameter is twice 800:8, or 1700:6.

84. Relation between Horizontal Parallax and Distance.
|Since we have

sinph=R
D;

it follows of course that D=Rsinph;

or, (nearly) D=20626500

If the sun's parallax equals 800:8,

its distance =206265

85. Equatorial Parallax. |Owing to the \ellipticity" or
\oblateness" of the earth the horizontal parallax of a body varies
slightly at dierent places, being a maximum at the equator, where
the distance of an observer from the earth's centre is greatest. It is
agreed to take as the standard the equatorial horizontal parallax;
i.e., the earth's equatorial semi-diameter as seen from the body.

86. Diurnal Parallax. |The parallax we have been discussing
is sometimes called the diurnal parallax , because it runs through all
its possible changes in one day.

When the sun, for instance, is rising, its parallax is a maximum,
and by throwing it down towards the east, increases its apparent right
ascension. At noon, when the sun is on the meridian, its parallax is
a minimum, and aects only the declination. At sunset it is again a
maximum, but now throws the sun's apparent place down towards the
west. Although the sun is invisible while below the horizon, yet the par-
allax, geometrically considered , again becomes a minimum at midnight,
regaining its original value at the next sunrise.

The qualier, \diurnal," is seldom used except when it is nec-
essary to distinguish between this kind of parallax and the annual
parallax of the xed stars, which is due to the earth's orbital mo-
tion. The stars are so far away that they have no sensible diurnal
parallax (the earth is an innitesimal point as seen from them); but
some of them do have a slight and measurable annual parallax, by
means of which we can roughly determine their distances. (Chap.
XIX.)

87. Smallness of Parallax. |The horizontal parallax of even
the nearest of the heavenly bodies is always small. In the case of the
moon the average value is about 570, varying with her continually
changing distance. Excepting now and then a stray comet, no other
heavenly body ever comes within a distance a hundred times as
great as hers. Venus and Mars approach nearest, but the parallax
of neither of them ever reaches 4000.

88. Semi-Diameter. |In order to obtain the true altitude of
an object it is necessary, if the edge, or \limb," as it is called,
has been observed, to add or deduct the apparent semi-diameter
of the object. In most cases this will be sensibly the same in all
parts of the sky, but the moon is so near that there is quite a
perceptible dierence between her diameter when in the zenith and
in the horizon.

CORRECTIONS TO ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS. 64

A glance at Fig. 34 shows that in the zenith the moon's distance is less
than at the horizon, by almost exactly the earth's radius|the dierence
between the lines OZandOPh. Now this is very nearly one-sixtieth part
of the moon's distance, and consequently the moon, on a night when its
apparent diameter at rising is 300, will be 3000larger when near the
zenith. Since the semi-diameter given in the almanac is what would be
seen from the centre of the earth , every measure of the moon's distance
from stars or from the horizon will require us to take into account this
\augmentation of the semi-diameter," as it is technically called.

The formula, easily deduced from the gure by remembering that the
anglePCO = p(zenith distance parallax), and that the appar-
ent and \almanac" diameters will be inversely proportional to the two
distancesOPandCP, is

apparent semi-diameter = almanac s. d. sin
sin ( p):

This measurable increase of the moon's angular diameter at high
altitudes has nothing to do with the purely subjective illusion which
makes the disc look larger to us when near the horizon . That it is
a mere illusion may be made evident by simply looking through
a dark glass just dense enough to hide the horizon and interv
