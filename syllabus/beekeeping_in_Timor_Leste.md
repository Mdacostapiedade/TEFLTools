# Sustainable Beekeeping: A Permaculture Approach for Timor-Leste

## Course Overview and Objectives

This course introduces sustainable beekeeping practices tailored for Timor-Leste, integrating permaculture principles with traditional knowledge. Students will learn to establish and maintain healthy bee colonies using locally-appropriate methods that support biodiversity and community resilience. The course emphasizes hands-on experience with native Timorese bees, natural hive designs, and the creation of bee-friendly landscapes using indigenous plants.
