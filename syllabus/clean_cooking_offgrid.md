This syllabus is designed to be culturally appropriate for Timor-Leste, considering the local context of cooking practices, available resources, and community structures. The hands-on activities and community engagement components are crucial for ensuring practical application of the knowledge gained. The course should be delivered in local languages (Tetum and Portuguese) and adapted as needed based on specific regional variations within Timor-Leste.
