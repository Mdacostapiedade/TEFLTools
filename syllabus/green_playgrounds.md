# Designing Urban Green Infrastructure for Climate Resilience and Stormwater Management in Timor-Leste

## Course Overview and Objectives

This course examines how cities in Timor-Leste can design and implement green infrastructure, particularly in parks and public spaces, to build climate resilience and manage stormwater. It covers the impacts of climate change on urban areas in Timor-Leste, various green infrastructure design strategies appropriate for the local context, policy approaches for implementation, and the multiple environmental, economic and social benefits. Case studies highlight innovative projects that transform urban spaces, revitalize neighborhoods, and create multi-functional green areas while improving stormwater management and climate resilience in Timor-Leste's unique tropical environment.

Course objectives:
- Understand climate change impacts on urban areas in Timor-Leste 
- Learn green infrastructure design principles and techniques appropriate for Timor-Leste
- Analyze policy and planning approaches for implementing green infrastructure
- Evaluate the multiple benefits of green infrastructure projects
- Develop skills to design green infrastructure solutions for Timorese urban contexts
