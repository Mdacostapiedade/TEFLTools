This course explores the intricate relationship between nutrition, gut microbiota, and mental health across the human lifespan, with a focus on the Timorese context. Students will examine how dietary choices influence brain function, neuroplasticity, and the development of mental health disorders through the brain-gut-microbiota axis. The course emphasizes the importance of understanding these connections for developing effective interventions and promoting overall brain health and well-being in Timor-Leste.
