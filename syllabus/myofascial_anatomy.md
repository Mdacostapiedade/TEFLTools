# Myofascial Anatomy and Movement Integration for Timor-Leste

## Course Overview and Objectives

This course examines the body's myofascial system as an interconnected whole, moving beyond isolated muscle function to explore myofascial continuities and meridians in the context of Timor-Leste. It introduces the Anatomy Trains concept as a framework for understanding how myofascial connections influence posture, movement, and manual therapy approaches. The course integrates anatomical knowledge with practical applications for assessment and treatment, emphasizing cultural relevance and appropriateness for Timor-Leste.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand the concept of fascia and myofascial continuity
- Identify and palpate major Anatomy Trains myofascial meridians
- Analyze posture and movement patterns using the Anatomy Trains framework
- Apply myofascial anatomy concepts to manual and movement therapy techniques
- Integrate cultural considerations when applying these concepts in Timor-Leste
