# Neuroscience and Society in Timor-Leste

## Course Overview and Objectives

This course explores the intersection of neuroscience, philosophy, and society, with a focus on applying these concepts to the cultural context of Timor-Leste. Students will examine how brain structure and function influence human behavior, decision-making, and social dynamics. The course aims to develop critical thinking skills and encourage students to consider the ethical implications of neuroscientific advances in Timorese society.

- Topics:
  * Neuroanatomy overview
  * Neurotransmitters and synaptic transmission
  * Theories of consciousness
  * Free will debate in neuroscience
- Activities:
  * Group discussion on traditional Timorese beliefs about the mind and consciousness
  * Create a mind map of brain regions and their functions

## Learning Unit 2: Lateralization of Brain Function
- Objectives:
  * Understand hemispheric specialization
  * Explore the concept of brain lateralization in cognition and behavior
- Topics:
  * Left and right hemisphere functions
  * Language lateralization
  * Spatial processing and creativity
- Activities:
  * Conduct simple experiments to demonstrate hemispheric specialization
  * Debate the influence of brain lateralization on Timorese art and culture

## Learning Unit 3: Neuroscience of Decision-Making
- Objectives:
  * Understand neural mechanisms of decision-making
  * Explore cultural influences on decision-making processes
- Topics:
  * Reward pathways in the brain
  * Emotional influences on decision-making
  * Cultural neuroscience perspectives
- Activities:
  * Case study analysis of decision-making in Timorese community leadership
  * Role-play exercise demonstrating cultural differences in decision-making

## Learning Unit 4: Memory and Learning
- Objectives:
  * Understand the neurobiology of memory formation
  * Explore traditional and modern learning practices in Timor-Leste
- Topics:
  * Types of memory (short-term, long-term, procedural)
  * Neuroplasticity and learning
  * Cultural transmission of knowledge
- Activities:
  * Interview elders about traditional memory techniques
  * Design a learning activity that incorporates neuroscience principles and Timorese cultural elements

## Learning Unit 5: Neuroscience of Emotion and Social Behavior
- Objectives:
  * Understand neural bases of emotion and social cognition
  * Explore cultural expressions of emotion in Timor-Leste
- Topics:
  * Limbic system and emotion regulation
  * Mirror neurons and empathy
  * Cultural variations in emotional expression
- Activities:
  * Analyze Timorese folklore for emotional themes and social norms
  * Create a cultural emotion map comparing Timorese and Western emotional expressions

## Learning Unit 6: Neuroethics and Society
- Objectives:
  * Understand ethical implications of neuroscientific advances
  * Explore potential applications and challenges in Timorese society
- Topics:
  * Neuroenhancement and cognitive liberty
  * Privacy and brain data
  * Neuroscience in education and law
- Activities:
  * Debate the use of neurotechnology in Timorese schools
  * Develop guidelines for ethical neuroscience research in Timor-Leste
