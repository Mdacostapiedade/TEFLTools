# Earth System Science and Planetary Boundaries in Timor-Leste

## Course Overview and Objectives

This course explores the concept of planetary boundaries as a framework for understanding the limits of Earth's capacity to sustain human development, with a focus on Timor-Leste's unique environmental challenges and opportunities. Students will examine critical Earth system processes, their current status, and the risks associated with exceeding safe thresholds. The course emphasizes the interconnected nature of Earth's systems and the need for an integrated approach to global and local sustainability challenges.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of planetary boundaries and its relevance to Timor-Leste
2. Analyze the current status of key Earth system processes
3. Evaluate the risks of exceeding planetary boundaries in the Timorese context
4. Develop strategies for sustainable development within planetary limits
5. Apply Earth system thinking to local environmental challenges
