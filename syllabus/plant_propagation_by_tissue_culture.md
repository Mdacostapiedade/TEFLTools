# Plant Biotechnology and Tissue Culture Techniques for Timor Leste

## Course Overview and Objectives

This course introduces students to fundamental concepts and laboratory techniques in plant biotechnology, with a focus on tissue culture and micropropagation methods relevant to Timor Leste's agricultural context. Students will learn sterile techniques, media preparation, and plant tissue culture procedures to clone and propagate plants in vitro. The course explores applications in plant research, agriculture, and commercial plant production while providing hands-on experience with plant biotechnology methods. Emphasis will be placed on crops and plants important to Timor Leste's economy and food security.
