# Saline Agriculture for Timor-Leste

## Course Overview and Objectives

This course aims to introduce saline agriculture techniques and salt-tolerant crops to farmers and agricultural students in Timor-Leste. The goal is to expand agricultural production in coastal and saline-affected areas, improving food security and economic opportunities. By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

- Understand the principles of saline agriculture
- Identify salt-tolerant crops suitable for Timor-Leste's climate and conditions
- Apply techniques for managing saline soils and irrigation
- Develop plans for implementing saline agriculture projects in their communities
